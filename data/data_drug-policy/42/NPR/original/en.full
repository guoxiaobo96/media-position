{"original": "California Exchange Chief Rips UnitedHealth For Obamacare Excuses\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images\\n\\nAmid growing questions over the future of Obamacare exchanges, the head of California's marketplace said the nation's largest private health insurer should take responsibility for nearly $1 billion in losses and stop blaming the federal health law.\\n\\nIn a blistering critique, Covered California's executive director, Peter Lee, said UnitedHealth Group Inc. made a series of blunders on rates and networks that led to a $475 million loss in 2015 on individual policies across the country. The company estimates a similar exchange-related loss of $500 million in 2016.\\n\\nInstead of saying, 'We screwed up,' they said, 'Obamacare is the problem and we may not play anymore,'  Lee said in an interview with California Healthline. It was giving an excuse to Wall Street and throwing the Affordable Care Act under the bus.\\n\\nLee, a staunch defender of the health law and a former official in the Obama administration, has tangled with UnitedHealth in the past. He knocked the company for sitting out the launch of Obamacare in 2014, then welcomed UnitedHealth into Covered California for 2016.\\n\\nBut now, he said, the company is driving me bonkers because it has fed this political frenzy that Obamacare doesn't work. It's total spin and unanchored in reality.\\n\\nA company spokesman declined to comment on Lee's criticism, and referred to UnitedHealth's previous statements on the exchange business.\\n\\nDuring a Nov. 19 conference call with analysts, UnitedHealth's CEO Stephen Hemsley said: We can't really subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself. ... I think that basically is an industrywide proposition.\\n\\nAn Urban Institute report issued last week, however, found that some of UnitedHealth's troubles may have been self-inflicted. The company's premiums were substantially higher than its competitors' in many of the largest U.S. markets. The insurer also offered broader provider networks that tend to attract sicker customers who incur big medical bills.\\n\\nIn November, UnitedHealth surprised analysts and health-policy experts with its steep losses and said it might leave the exchanges altogether, just after expanding into new states. The sudden reversal prompted questions about the sustainability of the government-run marketplaces, the linchpin of President Obama's signature law.\\n\\nUnitedHealth reiterated its dour outlook for the exchange market when it announced quarterly results Jan. 19. The company said it has seen an influx of sicker patients during special enrollment, fewer healthy people signing up and costs rising as a result.\\n\\nUnitedHealth ended last year with about 500,000 customers in the public exchanges, and it expects membership to grow to about 800,000 during the recent open enrollment. It has said it will decide by midyear whether to continue selling in Obamacare marketplaces.\\n\\nOther major insurers have expressed similar concerns about doing business in the public exchanges, albeit with less red ink than UnitedHealth.\\n\\nAnthem Inc., the nation's second-largest health insurer, said last week that its exchange enrollment in California and 13 other states was running about 30 percent below expectations, but the business was still slightly profitable. Anthem ended last year with 791,000 exchange members.\\n\\nOn Monday, insurance giant Aetna Inc. said it lost up to $140 million, or a negative margin of 3 percent to 4 percent, on individual coverage last year. It has 1 million members with individual policies, about 75 percent of them on public exchanges. The company said it expects to break even this year, however.\\n\\nOur individual commercial business ended the year with improved results, Aetna's chief executive, Mark Bertolini, said Monday during an earnings conference call. Despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.\\n\\nIn response to industry criticism, the Obama administration is taking steps to prevent the misuse of special enrollment so people can't wait to sign up until they need care. Special enrollment is designed for people who lose coverage or need to make a change because of an event in their life, such as moving, getting married or having a child.\\n\\nInsurance markets can't function properly without enough healthy customers paying premiums, which are used to cover expenses incurred by sicker policyholders. The three-month open enrollment period for the federal and state exchanges just ended Jan. 31. California extended its deadline to Feb. 6 for people who already had begun the sign-up process by Sunday.\\n\\nJohn Holahan, a health-policy researcher at the Urban Institute, said the Obama administration does need to impose stricter rules for special enrollment. He also said concerns over affordability have hampered enrollment because some middle-class consumers and young, healthy people are put off by high premiums and large deductibles.\\n\\nBut I haven't seen anything that shows the exchanges are really in trouble, Holahan said. That doesn't mean every insurer is going to make it. Some companies don't make it, and that isn't a sign markets are unsustainable.\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services expects about 10 million people to be enrolled in federal and state exchanges at the end of 2016. That's far below previous government forecasts.\\n\\nUnitedHealth sat out Covered California for the first two years before joining in several rural areas. Lee said both sides will be analyzing whether the company returns for 2017. As an active purchaser, Covered California can decide whether or not to contract with certain health plans and allow them on the state exchange.\\n\\nUnited will be looking at what their prospects are in California, Lee said.\\n\\nWe will be looking at United as a plan to see if they offer good value for Californians. It's to be determined on both ends.\\n\\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California HealthCare Foundation."}
{"original": "Jeff Sessions Warns Illegal Border Crossers Of 'Zero Tolerance'\\n\\nAttorney General Sessions on Monday announced a tough policy on the southwest border. If you cross the border illegally, he said, you will be prosecuted and children will be separated from parents.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions insists that from now on, it's zero tolerance. He says anybody crossing the border illegally into the United States will now be prosecuted. That means anybody. Even people who ask for asylum will be prosecuted while seeking asylum. Sessions also warned that parents who come with their children may be separated. NPR's John Burnett covers the border. He's in our studios.\\n\\nJohn, good morning. Good to see you.\\n\\nJOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Morning, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So why would Sessions take this step, even against people seeking asylum?\\n\\nBURNETT: Well, he says people were taking advantage of the asylum process, that they would be released while their cases were working their way to immigration court. And now he says the Justice Department may lock them up. Recently, there has been a spike in the number of apprehensions on the Southwest border. Officials say in April, for the second month in a row, more than 50,000 people were caught entering illegally. That's triple the number from last year in the same month. And what complicates this is that many of the crossers were families with small children, asylum-seekers who say they are fleeing criminal violence in Central America. And so the Trump administration has been threatening for months to impose really severe measures to stop this migration of families, and that's what Sessions announced yesterday.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJEFF SESSIONS: If you're smuggling a child, then we're going to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law. If you don't want your child to be separated, then don't bring him across the border illegally.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So he's not defining a parent with a child here. He's saying, you're smuggling a child. What happens to the children?\\n\\nBURNETT: I mean, imagine federal agents forcibly separating children from their parents, kids as young as 4 years old. And if it's their first offense, the parent will be charged with an immigration misdemeanor. That's usually punishable by up to six months in a federal institution, though usually, it's a matter of weeks. Obviously, they can't lock up the kids, so they'll be handed over to another government agency, Health and Human Services. They contract with a network of juvenile shelters that take care of the kids and try to find foster homes for them.\\n\\nINSKEEP: How big a change is this, John Burnett?\\n\\nBURNETT: It's huge if they follow through with it. A month ago, I was in El Paso, and I met some immigrant families at a shelter there. They'd fled Guatemala and Honduras with their small kids in tow. They did what's called a credible fear interview. They asked for asylum. If they pass the interview, they had electronic ankle monitors strapped on, and then most of them hopped on a Greyhound and went to their cities of destination to await their day in immigration court. The immigrant families actually know if they travel with kids, they'll likely be released while their immigration courses go through the system. So this new policy of separation is supposed to be a harsh deterrent.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, how have immigrant advocates responded?\\n\\nBURNETT: Well, you can imagine this has caused a great upset across the land. The government has been separating children from families even before this, and human rights activists have been protesting it for months. In their defense, immigration officials said they would only separate families if the mom was unfit to care for their offspring or if they couldn't prove parentage. What Sessions is doing now has shocked people because this becomes an across-the-board policy.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Although, is this practical? Can the government actually prosecute tens of thousands of people per month, which is what we're talking about here?\\n\\nBURNETT: So these judicial districts along the border are already really crowded with lots of drug and human smuggler prosecutions. The Justice Department says it has sent 35 prosecutors to the border and 18 immigration judges. I spoke to a former U.S. attorney in Texas, Johnny Sutton, yesterday. He was appointed by a Republican, and he said, it's doable, but it's really going to take a lot more resources, more prison beds to lock up these immigrant parents, and they'll need more federal judges who are willing to take on all these misdemeanor immigration cases in already bulging dockets.\\n\\nINSKEEP: John, thanks very much, really appreciate it.\\n\\nBURNETT: You bet.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR's John Burnett covers the border.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Leaves White House For The Last Time As 45th President\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nThis is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThe sun rose over this city this morning for the last time with Donald Trump as president of the United States. It is a perfect morning. It's often cold on Inauguration Day - always January 20 - but less cold this time, with the temperature in the low 40s, heading up to 52 a bit later today. This morning, President-elect Biden will attend a prayer service. Leaders of Congress will join him, including Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell will be at that prayer service with the president-elect.\\n\\nA pandemic-restricted crowd of people is beginning to move toward the heavily guarded United States Capitol, which is where Biden takes the oath of office in about four hours, noon Eastern time today. And right now, we are watching video images of Marine One, the presidential helicopter, which has just landed on the South Lawn of the White House just in a bit of shade there, sun on other parts of the lawn. That chopper will take President Trump to Andrews Air Force Base for his final departure from Washington, D.C.\\n\\nNow, as we wait for the president to make that move, we're joined by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith, who has covered the whole of the Trump presidency and is with us once again. Tam, good morning.\\n\\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. Yeah, you and I were there on the west front of the Capitol four years ago.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Oh, my goodness. That's right. I've got pictures to prove it, and it was a lot colder then - a lot colder. This is a dramatic moment. Can you talk us through what the departing president's plans are for today?\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. So he is not following what has been a 150-year tradition of attending the inauguration of his successor. That peaceful transfer of power, that symbolism isn't going to be there. Instead, he will be heading out to Marine One at some point quite soon, and then he will go to Joint Base Andrews, the base where Air Force One awaits him. We are told by an administration official that he will deliver some remarks there, and then he will board Air Force One for the last time and head off to Florida.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And I guess we should mention that they are preparing to load the chopper here. The rotor blades are stopped on the South Lawn of the White House, and people have brought out a few containers. And the red carpet is rolled out for the president to depart for the last time. We do not see him yet.\\n\\nBut let's talk about that ceremony, which we're going to cover live here on NPR News. You said the president is scheduled to give remarks. There's been some news reporting in recent days about who, if anyone, would be there. It seems to be a kind of a frantic casting about of inviting people to try to find people who want to see him off.\\n\\nKEITH: Well, I can tell you who won't be there, and that's Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader of the House, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate. And Vice President Pence also will not be there. Pence is attending the inauguration at the Capitol. Now, logistically, he probably could've done both, but he will be attending that inauguration. And, you know, Pence has over the last couple of weeks really chosen to side with the Constitution in telling President Trump that he couldn't overturn the results of the election and ultimately certifying the election results and in sticking with tradition in going to this ceremony.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And Vice President Biden - I say vice president because that was his role - President-elect Biden said publicly he would be honored to have Vice President Pence there. Biden said he didn't seem to mind that President Trump was going to skip the inauguration, but he found it important and meaningful to him that Pence is showing up.\\n\\nKEITH: Right. And, you know, one of President Trump's last tweets before being completely deplatformed was to say that he wouldn't be there at the inauguration. In fact, President Trump, as we await his departure from the White House, he still has not congratulated Joe Biden either on the phone or in one of the videos that he's released. He released another video last night talking about his accomplishments as president, saying that there would be a transition, wishing the new administration luck, but never saying Joe Biden's name. He can't seem to bring himself to say Biden's name. And certainly during the campaign, Trump had said, you know, he couldn't imagine a candidate like Joe Biden beating him. What would he do with himself if Joe Biden won? Well, Joe Biden won, and President Trump is leaving office pretty much unlike anyone else.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And we're going to find out what he's going to do with himself over the next weeks and months and so forth. Let's bring another voice into this conversation. NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving has seen a few inaugurations. Ron, I don't want to give away your age by suggesting how many, but I imagine you've seen a lot. How different is this from any other inauguration you've seen?\\n\\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: It's unique - there's really no other word for it - and for a number of reasons, all of which have to do with Donald Trump. One reason it's unique is because we have an almost occupational-level force of something like 25,000 National Guard occupying Washington for the sole reason that there was a riot and an invasion of the Capitol two weeks ago that even the Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, has said was incited by President Trump.\\n\\nAnd today it's also unique because we are not going to see a president stand up and hand over the reins of power figuratively, almost literally, at noon on the 20 of January, as is provided by the Constitution and American tradition, both of which matter a great deal to creating a sense of order for the nation as a whole.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, let's hear a little bit of what the departing president had to say in that video message last night. Tamara mentioned that he never got around to saying Joe Biden's name. He was, in some ways, still defiant, although he did acknowledge that a new administration was coming. He never quite said that he lost the election, which is what officials from both parties in all 50 states, as well as dozens of courts, did find. The president had this to say, a kind of reference to the fact that he was knocked off social media for inciting a mob. Let's listen.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That's not who we are. It will never be who we are.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Tamara Keith, can you talk us through the president's immediate future here in terms of both politics and his legal issues? What awaits him once he gets on the plane and gets to Florida?\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. He has certainly hinted, and we have reporting that he's had lengthy discussions with his aides over the last couple of months about trying to launch some sort of new campaign to run again in 2024 to win back the presidency. But all of that is seriously in question after January 6, when there was an insurrection inspired by his words and his inability to admit that he had lost a free and fair election. And as a result of that, he has been impeached by the House. He is the only president ever impeached twice, and he now awaits a trial in the Senate.\\n\\nIt's not clear at this point who is going to represent him in that trial. He will be a former president. He will not have a White House counsel at his disposal. And some of the lawyers who represented him in his first impeachment and also in the Russia investigation have made it clear that they do not intend to represent him this time.\\n\\nThat doesn't even get into the investigations that are happening in New York state related to his business dealings and any number of other sort of legal and financial entanglements that he faces after leaving office.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that Senate trial, which we expect to come within days. The impeachment paperwork has not formally been sent over to the Senate and seems unlikely to be until a little bit later today, I guess, when Democrats formally take control of the Senate as new senators are sworn in. Something quite dramatic happened yesterday that relates to that trial. And let's remember, of course, they're not going to throw the president out of office. He's already leaving. But it's possible that he could be barred from holding office again. And this is, of course, also the verdict of history.\\n\\nThis Senate trial would require Republican votes for there to be a conviction because even though Democrats will have the barest of majorities, you need a two-thirds majority for conviction. And so it really matters what Republicans have to say. And we heard from the most important of those Republicans yesterday when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke of the events of January 6. Let's listen to a bit of what he said.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMITCH MCCONNELL: The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Ron Elving, so much in those few seconds there - first saying the mob was fed lies, referring to this long-running campaign by the president to pretend that he had won the election that he obviously lost, and also explicitly saying the president did this. They provoked - that he provoked the mob.\\n\\nELVING: That is a particularly stunning statement given that Mitch McConnell is still the Republican leader even after the majority changes hands. He is still representing 50 votes in the Senate. And also, he is going to be a juror. All 100 senators act as jurors in an impeachment trial. And we remember that the first time the president was impeached, Mitch McConnell was a highly effective organizer. He was not defending the president as one of his lawyers. But he was a highly effective organizer of the Republican vote against conviction, to support President Trump. And to have him pull that away in such explicit terms now is, at the very least, a green light to all Republican senators to follow their conscience, not to follow necessarily party or their vote in the first impeachment trial.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Can I mention one other bit? Oh, Tamara Keith, go right ahead.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. Let me just jump in to say that the single charge in this impeachment is incitement of insurrection. And what McConnell said, what those words were, he is saying that the insurrection was provoked by the president. That is very close to saying that he is guilty of what he is charged with.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yeah. And McConnell has said he's going to wait and hear the arguments before he decides. But if we said the charge was that the sky is blue, McConnell is saying, I'm going to wait for the facts to see if the sky is blue, but the sky is blue.\\n\\nELVING: But let's remember that there is, in a sense, a two-phase verdict in impeachment. It is possible that the senators could see the president as guilty of incitement but decide that, because he is no longer in office, it's not really an impeachable. And therefore, they don't have to vote for it. We heard that from some senators after the first impeachment. They said, we think he pretty much did everything he was accused of. But we don't think it rises to being an impeachable offense. Now you have the question of, can you impeach someone who's no longer in office? And the operative question is, can you bar him from future office?\\n\\nINSKEEP: And let's just go to one more little bit of that brief bit of audio that we heard from Senate Majority Leader - current Majority Leader McConnell, because he said that they were provoked. The crowd that was fed lies - and it's McConnell's word. The crowd that was fed lies was provoked by the president and by other powerful people. Who is McConnell understood to be talking about there?\\n\\nKEITH: Well, he is understood to be talking about fellow members of his - of the Senate, people like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, Republican senators who have their own not so well-hidden presidential ambitions.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And so there's going to be a lot of debate and a bit of conflict there as well. Let's bring another voice into this conversation as we wait to describe to you President Trump's departure from the White House and departure from Washington, D.C., his trip down to Florida today. NPR White House correspondent Scott Detrow covered Joe Biden's presidential campaign and is now standing by at the other end of the National Mall, a couple of miles away from the White House at the United States Capitol. And, Scott, would you just describe the scene there, please?\\n\\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: First, I want to fact check, Steve. You and Tam are saying it is warmer than it was four years ago. But I am here to tell you it is still cold on this inaugural platform.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, it's early in the morning. And you're on the west side of a very large building.\\n\\nDETROW: Yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Has the sun peeked over that building for you yet?\\n\\nDETROW: The sun is hitting the Washington Monument now. And it's creeping its way eastward toward the U.S. Capitol. And when it gets here, what it's going to see is a very different looking inaugural platform. You have the flags draping the front of the Capitol, the original 13-star flag, you know, other flags throughout American history. You have the bunting. You have the military band. They just brought out the big, comfortable armchairs where the president and vice president are going to be sitting before they're sworn in.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And let me just interrupt you, Scott, because the departing president of the United States, with holding hands with Melania Trump, has just emerged from the White House standing briefly on a red carpet and now stepping over toward a few people who are gathered there. I believe those would be members of the press and, perhaps, a few supporters as well.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. Those are the reporters.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK.\\n\\nKEITH: Those are journalists gathered there. The supporters are usually on the other side. So President Trump and the first lady - this is chopper talk. And this is one last chance for him to shout in the direction of the people he has called fake and enemies of the people.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And he just gave them a quick wave. If there is any audio, if he had any words to say, we'll, perhaps, get them a little bit later. And now President Trump, in a dark coat, dark suit and what looks to be a red tie from this great distance, Melania Trump, dressed also in dark colors, they're strolling across the grass. The sun, for the moment, has gone away. We're in shadow here. And they're stepping into the green and white form of Marine One, which will take, I believe, 10 to 15 minutes - no more than that - to race across Washington, D.C., the Washington area, to Andrews Air Force Base, which is a little bit east and south of here.\\n\\nTam, I'd just like to invite you to reflect a little bit. The president just stepped out of the White House, I would imagine, for the last time. I don't know that it's very common that a former president ever gets back into the White House. And this one in particular is not likely to be coming back in the next four years at least. It could be the last time that he's ever there. What are your thoughts as he prepares to go away?\\n\\nKEITH: Well, as president, he really cut himself off from the fraternity of former presidents. In a way, he is leaving in exile from the tradition of the American presidency. It has been a long four years, and the idea that America will not wake up to tweets, wondering who has been fired or what covfefe means, that - I mean, it's just - that members of Congress, that Republican members of Congress won't have to worry about being insulted by a president of their own party - this is going to be a very, very dramatic change.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You know, I would not be the first person to observe that life itself - if you are in journalism, if you cover any aspect of politics, life itself seemed to change the moment that President Trump's Twitter account was cut off.\\n\\nKEITH: Well, my kids then asked why I would ever look at Twitter again, so...\\n\\nINSKEEP: Did you have an answer to that, Tamara Keith?\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter) I don't have a good answer. I don't have a good answer. But certainly, you know, he really, in the last couple of weeks, has shrunk from the presidency, has shrunk from the ceremonial duties of the job. I mean, in many ways, much of the presidency included things that President Trump had little interest in. He had these legislative achievements. He, you know, he was able to nominate and get confirmed three Supreme Court justices, which is a remarkable thing for any president to have during especially just one term.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yeah.\\n\\nKEITH: But in the end, he took very little interest in the legislative process. In many ways, he just let the presidency wash over him. He picked fights and then had to solve the problems that he created. It was a cycle of self-defeat in so many ways.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And in the last couple of weeks after his Twitter was shut off, he had any number of other ways to communicate with the world. He could go on television at a moment's notice. There was certainly no shortage of things to talk about - the transition, the pandemic, various events in the world. But we heard very little from him the past couple of weeks.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. That's what I mean about him just sort of shrinking in the job. Ever since losing the election, he has had very little to say. He has taken almost no questions from reporters, as if he was unable to deal with any scrutiny about the big lie that was that he claims the election was stolen from him. He still hasn't admitted that he lost fair and square, even as he admits that he is leaving, and he is now on Marine One for the last time.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, perhaps our listeners can hear a rumbling sound. That is the sound of the rotors of Marine One, which have begun turning on the South Lawn of the White House, and we would expect any moment now for the chopper to take off and head, we would think, eastward and possibly over the head of NPR's Scott Detrow, who's a little bit south and east of there. And there's the chopper off the ground now.\\n\\nAnd, Scott Detrow, let's go to you. I want you to continue describing the scene where you are and what's happening on the west front of the Capitol, and I think you're going to get a view of the president passing over, if we're fortunate.\\n\\nDETROW: That's right. I'm looking down over the Mall, where we expect to see Marine One popping up any moment now. This Mall is, of course, totally empty. No one is able to come and stand on the Mall to watch Joe Biden's inauguration. Even before the attack on the Capitol, he had urged people not to come because of COVID.\\n\\nAnd I can see Marine One right now. It's flying at a low level. It's about to cross the Mall. And looking down, President Trump and the first lady will see a Mall covered with American flags that have been put there as a display for the people who could not come here.\\n\\nMarine One is just past the Washington Monument. It's banking west now, making its way toward the U.S. Capitol, so President Trump, even though he does not want to come to this inauguration, he can see the platform set up for Joe Biden, who will be president at noon. Vice President Mike Pence will be attending the ceremony. President Trump will not, but it looks like Marine One is now circling the Mall. It's making its way toward the Capitol still, on the eastern side of the Mall - the south side, rather. We can see Marine One right now. It's over the Botanic Gardens, if you've been to Washington, D.C.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Sure - a little bit to your left as you're looking out there, I believe.\\n\\nDETROW: That's right. And now we can hear it. It's passing directly over the U.S. Capitol now. Marine One is going over the House offices, offices where members of Congress had to barricade their doors two weeks ago because of the Trump extremists who had stormed the building. Marine One is now over the United States House Chamber, the place where President Trump delivered State of the Union addresses and where, just one week ago, he was impeached.\\n\\nLooks like it's banking around the east side of the building now, and this is about where the helicopter would've taken off had President Trump chosen to attend the inauguration of his successor. Typically, Joe Biden would've seen him off at the front of the Capitol and then gone into a luncheon. That's not happening, either.\\n\\nAnd I have now lost sight of the helicopter. It's making its way to Joint Base Andrews, where the president is going to have his ceremony and then take off on Air Force One.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You know, you're reminding me of a different inauguration in what seems like a different world, the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009, which was an inauguration attended by the departing president of the other party. George W. Bush had not been defeated. He was term limited. But he was very much at issue in that election, and the election of Obama was in some ways seen as a rebuke of George W. Bush. Very few people in that giant crowd for Obama were fans of George W. Bush. In fact, they cheered when his helicopter took off after the inauguration, but it was after the inauguration. George W. Bush showed up for that event.\\n\\nDETROW: They did. I was in the middle of the Mall that day as a member station reporter for WITF in Harrisburg. And the thousands and thousands of people all there to cheer Barack Obama took a moment from cheering and had less positive notes for President Bush as he circled the Mall and departed. Of course, a dozen years later, things are very different, and President Bush and President Obama have a friendly relationship. They'll be sitting next to each other today, and both of them have, in very different ways, spoken up against actions that President Trump has taken, particularly after the election, when he refused to concede the fact that he lost.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yeah. George W. Bush has made it clear through a spokesman that he wants to stay out of politics, that he's done with politics, but he made a number of strong statements, particularly after the attack on the Capitol but even before that, making - going out of his way to congratulate Joe Biden on the obvious election win in the face of false claims to the contrary.\\n\\nScott Detrow, as we await the arrival of Marine One at Andrews Air Force Base, which will be in the next 10 minutes or so, it looks like they are taking another trip - circuit around Washington, D.C., another last look for the departing president and first lady.\\n\\nDETROW: Yeah. I've caught sight of it again. The helicopter is about over the Museum of the Native American (ph), one of the Smithsonian museums here on the Mall. And now it looks like it is turning and heading in the direction of Joint Base Andrews after this loop of the Mall.\\n\\nINSKEEP: The symbolism of Washington, D.C., the symbolism of this chopper going over those particular locations that you're calling out - we could tell a story about just about every one. But I do want to ask about the president-elect, who you cover, because Marine One just passed over one portion of the National Mall that's not too far from the Lincoln Memorial, which is where the president-elect and vice president-elect were last night. Why were they there? What did they do?\\n\\nDETROW: They were there - and it's really hard to believe this. They were there to mark this pandemic that, as of yesterday, has killed 400,000 Americans. And what I say is hard to believe is that this was the first moment of a national memorial for a pandemic that has killed so many people, that has altered life in this country. It was a simple event. It was understated - Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, their spouses. The cardinal - Wilton Gregory, the cardinal of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., he gave a prayer. Biden and Harris briefly spoke. We heard two beautiful songs, Hallelujah and Amazing Grace.\\n\\nAnd then they stood and looked over the reflecting pool and lit lights. There were 400 lights, each one representing a thousand people who have died from this pandemic. And it was just a moment to pause and quietly mark the lives lost in something that's going to continue for several months even though Biden says - as he put it the other day, he wants to manage the hell out of this pandemic and, starting today, have a much more robust federal response to get vaccinations into people's arms and to get more tests out there so that we can start to get life slightly more back to normal.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Let's listen to a little bit of what the president-elect had to say at that ceremony last night.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: To heal, we must remember. It's hard sometimes to remember. But that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And we also heard Vice President-elect Kamala Harris say words to the effect of, you have - we have all suffered alone.\\n\\nDETROW: Yeah.\\n\\nINSKEEP: But now we can mourn together.\\n\\nDETROW: And it...\\n\\nINSKEEP: Go on, go on.\\n\\nDETROW: And it was - I mean, the social distancing we've all gotten used to but is still incredibly strange was just so striking to me. I was one of the reporters there. I was standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and just looking down at the total emptiness of the mall. Biden, Harris, Doug Emhoff, Jill Biden were standing there. Nobody was really around them, just a handful of reporters. Their families were off to the side. And the mall was totally empty. You're not used to seeing an empty mall in a moment like that, in a ceremony like that. But that's where we are right now in this country.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I also took a political message from that. If Vice President-elect Harris is saying we all had to suffer alone but now we will try to mourn together, it's not a direct criticism of the departing president. But it's implying just what you said. President Trump did not hold an event like that.\\n\\nDETROW: That's right. That's right. And I think Biden and Harris have been very careful, especially in the past few weeks as impeachment has started up again, to try to move on from President Trump. They have really resisted weighing in on everything that has happened. Their statements on the impeachment boil down to a simple statement. The House did impeach President Trump today. They do not want this - of course, they're not going to have a choice. The Senate's going to hold a trial. And that's going to slow down their early legislative agenda over the next few weeks. But I think, especially when we hear from Biden later today, he is going to try very hard to turn a page even if there will be all sorts of implicit rebukes of President Trump and what he has represented for this country in that inaugural address, in those messages of coming together.\\n\\nINSKEEP: There was some reporting suggesting that the president-elect was not entirely excited about the idea of a Senate trial that would go into the early days of his own presidency.\\n\\nDETROW: He - I was one of many reporters yelling this question at him as much as we could every time he was within earshot. And he would always revert to the same thing of simply saying, I've long thought President Trump should not be in office. He, of course, ran for president to get him out of office.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yes.\\n\\nDETROW: And the one thing that he said was, if this was midsummer, if there were months to go in this administration, we should do everything we can to get him out of office. But, of course, in a few hours, Trump will be out of office. And Biden is going to have to try to get his entire cabinet confirmed. No cabinet official has been voted on by the Senate yet. And we have two major pieces of legislation he's already proposed, a $1.9 trillion stimulus and a sweeping immigration bill that he's going to send to Congress later today.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Ron Elving, what are your thoughts as President Trump departs for the final time?\\n\\nELVING: This is a moment I think a lot of Americans have, in one sense or another, imagined, either in anticipation or, perhaps, in horror. I would like to know better what the thoughts are of all those people who breached the Capitol two weeks ago and marched in and, really, put an effective end to the Trump era meaning to do the opposite. They were meaning to extend it another four years. They really wanted Trump in office another four years and somehow had been led to believe that they could accomplish that by doing what they did that day.\\n\\nI wonder what they're thinking now as he leaves, as he goes off, truly, in ignominy, having been twice impeached, having had his own party leaders essentially leave him behind, having his vice president not attend his departure but instead choose to attend the inauguration of his rival. You have to wonder what those people are wondering about what they did and what the consequences of how blindly they followed President Trump will ultimately be for them.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And I want to mention that Marine One is now coming in low over Joint Base Andrews. So we would expect to see the departing president shortly and hear from the departing president shortly. But we now have some of his words. This is from a tweet by reporter Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg News, who, from the look of the photos that she's posted, was among that crowd of reporters watching the president and first lady as they left the White House and climbed on board the chopper. And she writes that Trump said it was, quote, the honor of a lifetime. He says thank you to the press. And he says he just wants to say goodbye and, quote, we love the American people. Those were the words of the departing president of the United States. Although, Tamara, I don't want to say they're out of character. But he was playing a different character any other time that he was confronting the press.\\n\\nKEITH: There are many different versions of President Trump. There's the version of the president who wanted approval from the press quite badly. There is the version of President Trump who attacked the press because they wrote the truth and because that truth could hurt him. And, you know, there is Twitter Trump, there is Teleprompter Trump, they're very, very different Trumps. There is Rally Trump. And I'm not sure which one will show up at Joint Base Andrews and deliver remarks now.\\n\\nBut I do know that in the audience, you have former members of his administration, you have longtime supporters, you have his family, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows. And it will be his final goodbye. Though, certainly, Donald Trump, before he was ever president, was really good at getting attention and monopolizing the news. And it's not clear what it will be like once he's out of office. He likely has, well, maintained that ability to drive the conversation with outrage and other things.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And it looks like just a small group of family and supporters are awaiting the departing president at Joint Base Andrews, which I earlier incorrectly called Andrews Air Force Base. It's Joint Base Andrews...\\n\\nKEITH: That's what it used to be called.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Exactly. Thank you.\\n\\n...In Maryland. Marine One is actually rolling along the tarmac not very far from Air Force One, so we would expect to hear from the president momentarily.\\n\\nBut I want to mention that NPR's Franco Ordoñez was also on the ground at the White House as the president departed, and I want to bring Franco into the conversation. Franco, we heard what the president's words were - that it was the honor of a lifetime, that he just wanted to say goodbye. Can you add to it a little bit of the body language? What did the president seem like as he departed for the last time?\\n\\nFRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah. It was very interesting. It was kind of a somber moment. You know, oftentimes, when President Trump would come out for these, you know, departures, chopper talk, as we'd sometimes say it colloquially, the president would come very, you know, close up to the cameras, up to the microphones and speak very boisterously.\\n\\nBut this time, you know, he kind of stood back. He stood a bit back with the first lady as he made these remarks and talked about how this was a, you know, an honor of the lifetime. He looked up at the White House several times in a somewhat of a longing way. You know, he thanked the American people. He thanked us. And, you know, he kind of ended on a note saying that this was not necessarily the end. But it was certainly a moment that he did not necessarily - you know, that I'm not sure he expected, and it's certainly not one that he was really hoping for in the last few weeks.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And I just want to mention as we look at these video images from Joint Base Andrews, I see Jared and Ivanka. I see the president's daughter and son-in-law. I see a few other close aides and family members. We don't have a full video sweep of the area, but it just does not look like a very large group of people who've come to see off the president. Tam?\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. The pool estimates it's about 200 to 300 people. It's cold.\\n\\nINSKEEP: (Laughter) It's cold. And it's, in some ways, a dramatic moment but, in some ways, an anticlimactic moment because it's been clear the way this has been headed for some time.\\n\\nKEITH: I just have to say, though, if this was in Florida, if this was at a fairgrounds in Florida, you'd still have tens of thousands of people or thousands and thousands of people - maybe 10,000, 15,000 - who would probably show up. President Trump still has an incredibly strong base of support, people who believe that they - he was fighting for them for these last four years, that his grievance was their grievance. And they truly still appreciate everything they did.\\n\\nAnd his legacy is going to last for quite some time, for any number of reasons, not just because of an insurrection that makes history, but also because there are three justices on the Supreme Court and lower courts packed with judges confirmed by the Senate led by Mitch McConnell. So as much as McConnell now is saying that Trump was to blame for that insurrection and has not ruled out voting to convict the president, McConnell got what he wanted. He got all of those judges through.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I'm glad you mentioned - as they've now opened Marine One here, I'm glad you mentioned the possibility that this departing president could draw a big crowd. We have every reason to think that is the case. And, in fact, there was a moment a couple of months ago, say, when a lot of Republican operatives were hoping he would do something like what you just described, that he would give up his fruitless pursuit of overturning the election, admit in some way, however unhappily, that he lost, and he might just go down to Mar-a-Lago and hold a giant rally the very day of the inauguration. That was a scenario that was available to this president, but he chose differently.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. I mean, in some ways, this is the tragedy of the last two months, that - President Trump's inability to admit loss. And this is a lifelong thing. You know, this is the same person who...\\n\\nINSKEEP: And I want to just interrupt you, Tam, to say that President Trump and Melania Trump have now come down the steps of Marine One, and they're walking over for some remarks, which we will get live. They're walking hand in hand. That crowd of 200 or 300 people does include both of the president's sons, Don Jr. and Eric Trump, along with Ivanka Trump and Lara Trump, Tiffany Trump and her fiance. Ivanka is there, as we mentioned. Kimberly Guilfoyle is there and a few other people.\\n\\nAnd we want to just mention that you're listening to Special Coverage from NPR News. And I think, perhaps distantly, you can hear in the background - let's bring up the sound.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nINSKEEP: We've got artillery firing and Hail To The Chief playing.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nINSKEEP: And they head to the platform. A president who had so badly wanted a giant military parade at some point in Washington is seen off with military-style honors, with artillery being fired. And let's listen.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUMP ADDRESS)\\n\\nINSKEEP: I believe I'm hearing, we love you.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUMP ADDRESS)\\n\\nINSKEEP: They're standing in front of a rolled (ph) American flag.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUMP ADDRESS)\\n\\nINSKEEP: We'll just note it's closer to 74 million, and he lost.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUMP ADDRESS)\\n\\nINSKEEP: We have a chant of, thank you, Trump, from the small crowd.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUMP ADDRESS)\\n\\nINSKEEP: Donald J. Trump in what we expect to be his final public remarks as president of the United States, although he does still have a bit more than three hours to go. If you're just joining us, the president was speaking at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C. Air Force One is nearby, and he and his - the first lady are about to climb on board and make the trip back to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Melania Trump making very brief remarks there. The president of the United States, Tamara Keith, I don't want to say entirely gracious. It's not a word that you associate with President Trump or that he seems to want to be associated with them, but he came as close as he has to seeming gracious to the new administration - still not saying Joe Biden's name, but saying he wished them great luck and great success and predicting that they will have great success.\\n\\nKEITH: Yes. And then adding that he left them a great foundation - so in a sense, taking credit for what is to come next. You know, I also - what really stood out to me was his effort to, as he say, pay his respects to the people who have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. He referred to it, as he often does, as the China virus. He said that - he really lingered on the idea that many people had suffered, which is something that he has not done much over the course of this past year. But last night, Joe Biden, the incoming president, held what amounted to a memorial service for the 400,000 Americans who have so far died. And President Trump seems to be, in essence, responding to that with his own words of condolence.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Although I feel obliged to mention here, Tamara Keith, he also said, you know, you need to be very, very careful, be very careful, be very careful - that's a quote from the president of the United States. But he's in this crowd. He was just shaking hands with people, giving people embraces, hands on the back. He's not wearing a mask. The first lady is not wearing a mask. Most of the people in the crowd are not wearing masks. A few of the people working, photographers and service members, are masked but not many other people.\\n\\nKEITH: Many of the people in that crowd are - you know, the people around the president have had the coronavirus and may still have some immunity. But also, let's just be honest - President Trump completely politicized mask-wearing. People around him made it like wearing a mask wouldn't be masculine. And President Trump's choice to doubt the value of masks, to undermine the use of masks, helped politicize something that is a basic public health measure that potentially, based on modeling, could have saved a lot of lives if it hadn't been politicized from the start. And even members of his own administration have said that they wished that it hadn't been politicized in that way.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, the president and first lady are walking a kind of gauntlet of soldiers with weapons at the ready up to the steps of Air Force One, and now they are climbing up the steps of Air Force One to get one final ride - a privilege afforded presidents at the end of their administration, of course, that they get a final ride back on Air Force One, which then returns to Washington, D.C., to be standing by at the service of the new president.\\n\\nAnd let's just describe the scene as they get to the top of the steps. He turns around for a last look at Andrews Air Force Base. The first lady does as well. And the president begins to applaud and wave and saying goodbye to his most dedicated supporters and his family. Notable there that he said his administration had worked hard, but he actually said, this family has worked very hard, acknowledging there the very close role that members of his family played as advisers to this administration.\\n\\nKEITH: Well, certainly Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were in the administration, but also the the president's adult children, although there was supposed to be a separation between the government and the politics and the business. A lot of that became intertwined. And his adult children were some of the best campaigners for him, becoming celebrities in their own right. And one wonders if any number of his adult children may ultimately run for office themselves. One thing to note in the president's remarks - he did go through sort of the greatest hits of his presidency, often inflating his accomplishments, as he has done...\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yes.\\n\\nKEITH: ...Many times. But he didn't mention what happened last week at the Capitol, the insurrection. He...\\n\\nINSKEEP: He had nothing to say about that.\\n\\nKEITH: He said nothing about it.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I - is subdued the right way? I mean, or mild? He just - he was not in a ferocious mood at all. But you're right - he was not referring at all to the events that he incited.\\n\\nKEITH: No, he didn't refer to it at all. I wouldn't call him subdued. That was sort of small-crowd Trump, small-crowd-rally Trump.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Oh, I see. Glad we have the years of observation to be clear on that. Ron Elving, I want to bring you into this conversation in just a moment. I do want to mention that it is about 10 minutes before 9 o'clock Eastern Time here in Washington, D.C. And the president-elect and the incoming first lady are expecting in just about 10 minutes or so to attend a religious service with leaders of Congress.\\n\\nAnd when I say leaders of Congress, I mean of both political parties. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, is expected there. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is expected there. But so, too, is Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, who has absolutely tangled in a very partisan way with Democrats over the years and can absolutely be expected to do so again. But on the occasion of this election, after being very slow to acknowledge Joe Biden's victory, has in recent weeks become much more definite, much more firm in insisting on the rule of law and the Constitution and the reality, as affirmed by election officials from both parties in all 50 states, as well as dozens of courts.\\n\\nNow, Ron Elving, in reflecting on the administration that's now coming to an end, I want to zero in on a remark that the president made in passing. He was referring to regular administrations, and he said, quote, we were not a regular administration. It seems that that is one line that the president and his critics would agree on.\\n\\nELVING: Yes, indeed. That is the statement that the nation can come together in agreement on. So what does that mean? It was not a regular administration. For millions, I think it means that he was an outsider, that he was able to bring the viewpoint of ordinary Americans who had felt forgotten to Washington and bring it to bear on policy. He worked closely with a lot of establishment people, of course, in order to get that done - mostly, of course, Republicans, and especially in the Senate because the Republicans had control there for all four years.\\n\\nBut it was, ultimately, also a highly irregular kind of administration when it came to the means that the president used - the, in some cases, extralegal, as we're struggling with right now with respect to the incitement of that invasion of the Capitol. It was irregular in a number of other ways - the way the president communicated, the degree to which the president relied on falsehoods, many every day, and selling them very hard to large rallies of people around the country. That was also something we have not seen in other presidential administrations, of all kinds, from both parties.\\n\\nINSKEEP: If you reflect on this, Ron Elving, is the - are the lies, the variance from truth, the falsehoods, the distortions, are they ultimately the distinguishing fact of this administration, even at the end? The thing that the president did that made it so clear that he had incited the attack on the Capitol was the claiming that he'd won the election when he had so obviously lost, the months of making that claim. It is impossible to imagine, really, that attack on the Capitol, certainly at that scale, without everything the president had said for months beforehand.\\n\\nELVING: That's right. It was a culmination of a long period of deception, a long period of overselling what the president had done. And we heard it, just a tiny little coda of it, in this small-rally Trump speech that we just carried live, in which he claimed things that were out of proportion to the reality - for example, the credit he takes for the changes that have come at the Veterans Administration, many of which had been initiated in the previous administration, the Obama administration.\\n\\nHe made a big deal about the treatment of veterans when he first began running for president. It was sort of the issue that transitioned him from birtherism, insisting Obama had not been born in America, to more legitimate issues, actual issues. And he made that transition largely through talking about the veterans and how they had been treated. And we heard a little - just a little echo of some of that misrepresentation this morning.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, I want to mention that it's time to talk about the new president or the incoming president, who is hours away from becoming president of the United States. Joe Biden and Jill Biden, along with leaders of Congress, will be attending a memorial service at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nI want you to know that it is a 19th century building, a building of stone and brick, a building of remarkable decor with murals on the inside and mosaics and just remarkable color, a very high-domed structure, a small but high cathedral in Washington, D.C. And it is a cathedral of a historic nature. There is a plaque in the floor noting that the coffin of John F. Kennedy rested in that spot. The funeral for President Kennedy after his assassination was held there at St. Matthew's Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. And that is where this religious observance will take place.\\n\\nOur White House correspondent Scott Detrow has been covering Joe Biden for many months throughout his campaign and is standing by at the Capitol, where Biden will be later on today. Scott, what is the day like for the president-elect?\\n\\nDETROW: Well, as you mentioned, he begins the day with mass. Biden - it's been overshadowed by all the other things happening, but Biden is just the second Catholic president, following President Kennedy, who as you mentioned had his funeral at St. Matthew's. Biden goes to church just about every week. He went to church the morning of Election Day. I've spent a lot of time in the pool van outside Biden's parish in Delaware, where he's been going for years.\\n\\nSo he starts the day with mass, and he has invited all of the congressional leaders to attend with him - Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, as well as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. And this is the first of many, many, many concerted efforts you will see from Joe Biden to reach out to Republican leadership, to treat them as equals and to try to craft deals with them and just interact with them as human beings. He is someone who's been in Washington for decades and decades and has always prized personal relationships and personal relationships across the aisle. So in the symbolism of the early days, you're going to see a lot of that.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And this is something that Biden himself - he seemed to be stung by criticism. He said in speeches again and again and again, people say I'm naive - which people actually did say...\\n\\nDETROW: Yeah.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...But that he believed that this was the way it was necessary to work. And we should note - shouldn't we? - Tamara Keith, having watched Washington work, even though Democrats will control Congress, the margins are narrow enough that he's going to need Republicans quite often to get things done.\\n\\nKEITH: Absolutely. He is going to need Republicans at almost every turn. The House margin is smaller - unlikely that you're going to get very many House Republicans on board with anything. But also, that Senate margin is just - it's a 50-50 Senate with the vice president breaking the tie. And there are - there is at least one and probably more than one Senate Democrat who will not necessarily toe the party line at every moment. But there are also Senate Republicans who are - who have built their brand on actually getting things done or trying to, who may be willing to partner with Biden. And as you've talked about, he has these long-standing relationships with members of the Senate. He spent his life as a Senate man before he became vice president.\\n\\nNow, will that be enough? Probably not. And I have lots of strong memories of the Obama administration covering Congress and, in particular, covering Republicans in Congress, where every single budget, every basic function of government was one big fight.\\n\\nDETROW: Though...\\n\\nKEITH: And at this moment, Joe Biden's trying to get $1.9 trillion in COVID relief, and already there's a lot of pushback coming from Republicans who say that's just too much.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Ron Elving, in just about 15 or 20 seconds, there's also the matter of the filibuster.\\n\\nELVING: That's right. It's possible with even a 50-50 Senate that Chuck Schumer could move to eliminate the filibuster. We're not anticipating that he's going to do that. And Mitch McConnell has certainly put up a fight for it and wants to make it part of the deal by which they're going to govern the Senate, 50-50, to keep the filibuster.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Which means that if you are President Biden, you need 10 Republicans, minimum, to pass ordinary legislation because it's gotten to the point where they routinely move to invoke cloture to cut off debate. You need to get up to 60 votes out of 100, a supermajority, and if you don't do that, you don't get anything done.\\n\\nI just want to note some of the video images we're watching as we head toward 9 o'clock Eastern Time. People are preparing for the service at St. Matthew's Catholic Cathedral. And at the very same time, Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland is taxiing to the end of the runway. President Trump is on board. First Lady Melania Trump is on board. And this plane is going to take the president and first lady out of Washington, D.C., for what could very well be the final time, although President Trump did say in his closing remarks to his supporters, we will be back in some form.\\n\\nWe're going to continue to have live coverage of the presidential inauguration throughout the day.

He advocates drilling for new sources of fuel and has battled with federal regulators (notably the Environmental Protection Agency) over rules aimed at curbing pollution and emissions.\\n\\nPerry has been a vocal skeptic of climate change.\\n\\nBut there is a green side to Perry's energy policy. Along with the traditional support of the oil and gas, Perry has overseen record growth in some renewable energy sectors. During Perry's ten years in office, Texas has become a world leader in wind power.\\n\\nThe governor's office website touts millions of dollars in investment from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund in renewable energy. It even features a video of the governor announcing more than $8 million for wind power research at Texas Tech University and touting the expansion of wind power transmission into major cities. But the Sierra Club points out that much of Texas' wind power infrastructure was mandated by electric deregulation that took place before Perry took office.\\n\\nPerry was criticized at times during his campaign for being absent from the state. While Rick Perry was away, Texans grappled with the impacts of a historic drought, the profits and pitfalls of a newly invigorated natural gas industry, and saw continued battles between state policymakers and the federal government over environmental regulations. During the Labor Day wildfires in Bastrop County, shouts of Where's the governor?! interrupted a speech by Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, who had been sent in Perry's place.

Two more candidates officially announced over the weekend – Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\\n\\nAnd while those two potentially embody the core split within the Democratic primary – pragmatism vs. pugilism – Trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: socialism vs. greatness.\\n\\nThe Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream, Trump said in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.\\n\\nPolitics State Of The Union Is Trump's First Major Speech In 2020 Election Cycle State Of The Union Is Trump's First Major Speech In 2020 Election Cycle Listen · 5:03 5:03\\n\\nIt's a message he began trying out a week ago during his State of the Union address. He tied the unrest in Venezuela to domestic U.S. politics.\\n\\nHere in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country, he said. America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\\n\\nThe denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to Democrats is Trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. The president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull Democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic Democrat, Trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of America.\\n\\nHe's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said Bruce Mehlman, a Republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department for technology policy. The resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last November. The economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. Mr. Mueller's report and/or Democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. And voters want change.\\n\\nRepublicans tried a version of Trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. They tried to paint Democrats as wanting to abolish ICE (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care.\\n\\nRepublicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. It didn't happen. Instead, in an election where Trump was front of mind, Democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the House by flipping 40 seats.\\n\\nIn 2020, Trump gets to try to make the argument himself. And people close to him think he can make a winning one.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said Andy Surabian, who worked in the 2016 Trump campaign war room, was political director for Tea Party Express and is now a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr. The biggest gift to Trump is for Democrats to nominate what I call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.\\n\\nMehlman added: If the Dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. But if they go hard left, there is a path for Donald Trump to get re-elected.\\n\\nIt is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. His potential Democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in GOP primaries).\\n\\nThe new debate over socialism\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n\\nAlready, many of the Democrats running or thinking about it are embracing Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal. Both of those ideas have been put forward by the party's two highest-profile democratic socialists — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\\n\\nThis is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the Democratic Party rather than at the fringes. Sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.\\n\\nIt's going to be interesting to see how Democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. The word makes many Americans — and some Democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.\\n\\nA remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more Democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), Gallup found last year.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nDon't see the graphic? Click here.\\n\\nThat diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of Americans have a positive view of socialism. Socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. Since Trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.\\n\\nThere is a huge generational divide: A majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. Older Americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.\\n\\nThis younger generation, after all, are not Cold War kids. Someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the Iron Curtain. The word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-World War II arms race with the Soviet Union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\\n\\nAs viewed by Americans, that debate was between the free, capitalistic West on one side and the repressive communism and socialism of the USSR on the other.\\n\\nSome Democrats are trying to find more nuance. Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, for example, sparked an interesting debate on the left with his tweet that he's not a socialist but does believe that every American deserves health care, that college should be debt free, and that America must lead boldly on climate change.\\n\\nAnd Schatz may be on to something. When younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like Venezuela or Cuba. To them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.\\n\\nPresident Trump is moving aggressively to define the Democrats as old-fashioned, Cold War-style socialists. Now, it's up to the Democrats to define what it is they are for.\\n\\nMuch of the difference comes down to semantics — the wording and view of what socialism really is.\\n\\nThe problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries."}
{"original": "FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's Republican Convention Speech, Annotated\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out America's struggles with crime, terrorism and immigration and how he plans to address them.\\n\\nNPR's politics team has annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.\\n\\nThank you, thank you. Thank you very much.\\n\\nFriends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\\n\\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\\n\\nWho would have believed that when we started this journey // because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed this. Who would have believed this.\\n\\nThe Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good. Not so good.\\n\\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.\\n\\nWe will be a country of generosity and warmth.\\n\\nBut we will also be a country of law and order.\\n\\n[Law and order has become a big theme for Trump in recent weeks, particularly since the killings of five police officers in Dallas. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\\n\\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.\\n\\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\\n\\n[Policing, public safety and the vast majority of the criminal justice apparatus are controlled by state and local authorities, not the federal government. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\\n\\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly.\\n\\nWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\\n\\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\\n\\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\\n\\n[Fact checkers might beg to differ. PolitiFact, for instance, has found a number of false statements uttered at this week's RNC. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nThese are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.\\n\\n[These data seem to come from a January Washington Post analysis that found homicides were up by 17 percent in 2015 over 2014, and that it indeed was the largest increase since 1990. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [However, violent crime is an intensely local phenomenon and murders were not up in all of those 50 cities. — Carrie Johnson] [And there's a broader context for crime figures: While violent crime may be climbing this year, rates are far below their peak in the early 1990s. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Americans in recent years have said they believe crime is getting worse even though the overall trend is down. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nIn our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\\n\\n[That same Post analysis found murders up by 54.3 percent in Washington, D.C., and 58.5 percent in Baltimore in 2015 over 2014. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone.\\n\\n[Just three days ago, the Chicago Tribune reported that nearly 2,200 people have been shot in Chicago this year, with 329 of those people dead. The Tribune also reported that that's 100 more such deaths than at this point last year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnd more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\\n\\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.\\n\\n[The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund says as of July 21, 2016, total fatalities this year compared with the same time last year reflect an increase of five deaths, or 8 percent. Deaths related to firearms are up by 14 deaths, or 78 percent. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nNearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\\n\\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.\\n\\n[The number of families apprehended this fiscal year along the Southwestern border thus far (that is, starting in October 2015) is around 51,000, according to Border Patrol data. That is already over the nearly 40,000 apprehended during fiscal year 2015. Total apprehensions are also on pace to exceed their 2015 total, as well, according to these data. However, that wouldn't be a very high number in the context of recent years; total apprehensions at the border today are far, far lower than they were in the early 2000s. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\\n\\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more.\\n\\nOne more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.\\n\\n[America does not have open borders. It has restrictions on immigration and Border Patrol agents who make hundreds of thousands of apprehensions a year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWhat about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed.\\n\\n[Thirty-six percent of African-Americans under 18 were below the poverty line as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. It's not entirely clear what Trump means by not employed, which is not technically the same as unemployed, which counts people who aren't working and are looking for work. However, the unemployment rate for black Americans ages 16 to 19 was 38.1 percent as of June. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\n2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.\\n\\n[That's roughly true, by the latest data available. Around 11 million Hispanic-Americans were in poverty in 2008, compared with 13.1 million in 2014. The poverty rate makes more sense to compare, though — that has grown 0.4 points since 2008, but it has also declined lately, down by nearly 3 points since 2010. As for whether President Obama is responsible for this, we get to that below. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnother 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\\n\\n[There's a lot going on in this statistic. So here goes: Trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force — that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). That figure has climbed by 14 million since January 2009 (importantly, this isn't people leaving the labor force; it's just people not in it, period). But while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing — Trump's 14 million figure might imply that it's not. And that low labor force participation isn't entirely about a tough economy — a lot of it is simple demographics. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office found that half of a recent 3-point drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. The other half was economic factors. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's sixteen years ago.\\n\\n[That's true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the Obama administration as he is for the other stats here. If he measured from 2008, the drop was $1,656. Measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure's near-peak. [A broader point about all of these economic statistics: A lot of them have been true, but the question is whether Obama is to blame. Higher poverty, for example, doesn't appear to be Obama's doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. Moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nOur trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone. We're going to fix that.\\n\\nThe budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\\n\\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.\\n\\n[PolitiFact has debunked this — that $150 billion is an estimate (and a high one) of the value of Iranian assets tied up by economic sanctions, according to the site. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnother humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.\\n\\n[The diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was not a consulate. Here's how former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell described it in a Politico article: [The State Department facility in Benghazi has been widely mischaracterized as a US consulate. In fact it was a Temporary Mission Facility (TMF), a presence that was not continuously staffed by senior personnel and that was never given formal diplomatic status by the Libyan government. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nAmerica is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\\n\\n[Editor's note: Crowd chants Lock her up.]\\n\\nLet's defeat her in November, okay?\\n\\nI am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.\\n\\n[President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed Clinton, so it would seem unlikely that he regrets choosing her to be his secretary of state. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nHer bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\\n\\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\\n\\n[Attacks on Hillary Clinton and the argument that she is part of the status quo that is making many Americans unhappy in their lives are a common theme at Trump rallies. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nThe problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.\\n\\nA change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.\\n\\n[Many of these ideas are familiar: making better trade deals, fighting terrorism, putting America first, and the notion that only a dramatic change in the leadership of the country will be able to solve national problems. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nTonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.\\n\\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve.\\n\\nThe American People will come first once again.\\n\\nMy plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.\\n\\nOn the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\\n\\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It's for their benefit.\\n\\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.\\n\\nThey are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\\n\\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever.\\n\\n[Clinton has reams of plans and proposals to change everything from the nation's immigration system and criminal justice policies to the way people pay for college. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nMy message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.\\n\\nEvery day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten. But they're not going to be forgotten long.\\n\\nThese are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.\\n\\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice -\\n\\n[Editor's note: Protester interrupts, crowd shouts USA]\\n\\nHow great are our police! And how great is Cleveland?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way.\\n\\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\\n\\n[There was no official determination that the private server was illegal, although the State Department inspector general found it was not approved and would not have been had Clinton asked. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless and negligent, in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.\\n\\n[FBI Director James Comey had plenty of criticism for Clinton but said no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton with a crime for the emails. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nThey were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.\\n\\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.\\n\\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.\\n\\nNobody knows the system better than me.\\n\\nWhich is why I alone can fix it.\\n\\nI have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. Never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.\\n\\n[Sanders had a lot of issues that he was deeply passionate about, including trade, but it wouldn't be at the top of his list. His campaign revolved most intensely around two things: income inequality and a broken campaign finance system. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nMillions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.\\n\\n[A recent Pew poll found that just 9 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning Sanders supporters said they planned to vote for Trump in the general election. 85% say they plan to vote for Clinton in the general election, compared with 9% who say they will vote for Trump and 6% who volunteer that they will vote for another candidate or don't know. [Sanders got approximately 12 million popular votes. Back-of-the-envelope calculation, 9 percent of 12 million is a bit more than 1 million, not millions. And that poll was taken before Sanders endorsed Clinton. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nIn this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\\n\\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. Which is amazing.\\n\\nHe's a man of character and accomplishment. He's the man for the job.\\n\\n[Trump is saying that he and Pence will improve U.S. trade deals, but trade is just one of several areas on which they differ. Pence has been a strong proponent of free trade in the past, having approved of NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as the New York Times reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nThe first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\\n\\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\\n\\nI have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me.\\n\\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.\\n\\n[The president does select U.S. attorneys, but those top federal prosecutors handle a small fraction of violent crime cases in the nation. Most murders, robberies and assaults are prosecuted by local authorities. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nIn this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.\\n\\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\\n\\n[The Brennan Center for Justice says overall crime rates from 2014 to 2015 were nearly identical. Violent crime rose by 3 percent over that period. — Carrie Johnson]\\n\\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and at every single level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\\n\\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child.\\n\\nTo make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.\\n\\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many many other locations.\\n\\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we're going to stop it.\\n\\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.\\n\\n[The party is well to Trump's right on LGBT issues, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported. The Log Cabin Republicans have called it the most anti-LGBT platform in GOP history, according to ABC News. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnd I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\\n\\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\\n\\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\\n\\nRecently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.\\n\\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\\n\\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this. Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening. A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.\\n\\nShe proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\\n\\n[PolitiFact ranked the claim about the lack of a vetting system false. [However, PolitiFact did find that Trump's number is correct as to the increase in refugee admissions proposed by Clinton. Interestingly, about a month ago, Trump said it would be a 500 percent increase. PolitiFact noted that it actually worked out to 550 percent. Trump has adjusted to the higher and more accurate number. [In 2015, the U.S. admitted (per the State Department) 1,682 Syrian refugees. That is well under President Obama's goal. It would be hard to argue that is massive. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.\\n\\nAnyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\\n\\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\\n\\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve. We have to solve it.\\n\\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.\\n\\nBut where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\\n\\nWhere was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.\\n\\nTonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\\n\\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.\\n\\nI have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.\\n\\nAnd will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\\n\\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me.\\n\\nPeace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve.\\n\\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.\\n\\nWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\\n\\nUSA. USA. USA.\\n\\n[Editor's note: Trump chanted along with the crowd here.]\\n\\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.\\n\\nHer plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.\\n\\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. Of which there are many.\\n\\nIt's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\\n\\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.\\n\\nUsing the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.\\n\\nAmerica has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.\\n\\n[As we have pointed out in two earlier Trump speech annotations, and as NPR's Chris Arnold reported this year, it appears that NAFTA didn't have a huge effect on jobs. As the Congressional Research Service reported in 2015, the agreement neither lived up to proponents' promises nor caused the massive job losses that opponents claimed it would. Also, Bill Clinton was not solely responsible for NAFTA; it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush before it became law under Clinton. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore.\\n\\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\\n\\nShe supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen.\\n\\nI pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence. We will never sign bad trade deals. America First again. America First.\\n\\nInstead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.\\n\\nWe are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats.\\n\\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about. They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.\\n\\nOur horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.\\n\\nOur country is going to start building and making things again.\\n\\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.\\n\\nMiddle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone.\\n\\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.\\n\\nReducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.\\n\\nThen we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.\\n\\n[A few analyses have found that regulation costs around $2 trillion — one of the best-known, from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, estimated it at around $1.9 trillion this year. But as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out, in the past this figure has been characterized as a back of the envelope count, and that moreover, it doesn't make sense to talk about costs without trying to count the benefits of regulation. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.\\n\\nThis will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.\\n\\nWith these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\\n\\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing. And that's what's she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\\n\\nYou will be able to choose your own doctor again.\\n\\nAnd we will fix TSA at the airports! Which is a total disaster.\\n\\nWe're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problem.\\n\\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.\\n\\nWe will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.\\n\\nMy just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.\\n\\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal. One more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.\\n\\nThe politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.\\n\\n[Editor's note: Crowd chants Yes You Will]\\n\\nWe are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\\n\\nThe replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\\n\\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what. Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing. And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True. So true.\\n\\nThey have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\\n\\n[Here's an IRS explanation of the rules on churches and taxes, saying that to be tax-exempt, a church may not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office. This LA Times piece from 2008 is a breakdown of some of the arguments for and against the Johnson Amendment. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.\\n\\nWe can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\\n\\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job.\\n\\n[There's also a bit more of the personal in this speech. Trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. This week we've seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nMy Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.\\n\\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.\\n\\nHe was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\\n\\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\\n\\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.\\n\\nI have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again.\\n\\nBut to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\\n\\nRemember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance. The same people. Oh we love defeating those people. Don't we? Don't we? Love it. Love it. Love it.\\n\\nNo longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.\\n\\n[Americans as a whole aren't fans of the news media, but Republicans dislike the media even more. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 17 percent of Republicans say the national news media has a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, compared with 33 percent of Democrats. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nInstead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. We don't have much time, but history is watching. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.\\n\\nI am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House. And I will be your champion.\\n\\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: I'm With Her. I choose to recite a different pledge.\\n\\n[I'm With Her started out as a hashtag and sometimes supporters do chant it at events, but the Clinton campaign doesn't ask supporters to pledge loyalty by reciting it. The campaign's current slogan is Stronger Together. — Tamara Keith]\\n\\nMy pledge reads: I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\\n\\nI am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\\n\\nTo all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.\\n\\nGod bless you, and goodnight. I love you."}
{"original": "Why China Supports New Sanctions Against North Korea\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nInternational pressure on North Korea has ratcheted up in recent days, as the U.S. imposed new unilateral sanctions and China began taking steps to implement a strict, new United Nations Security Council resolution.\\n\\nBut while the U.S. has few economic ties with North Korea to cut, China has plenty of screws to tighten. And so whether international sanctions work or fail may depend to a large degree on how strictly China implements them.\\n\\nBeijing has begun instructing Chinese banks, ports and shipping and trading companies doing business with North Korea to implement the U.N. resolution to the letter.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Don Emmert /AFP/Getty Images Don Emmert /AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAdam Szubin, the Treasury Department's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, tells NPR that China is taking this very seriously.\\n\\nI know from my meetings here in Beijing that my counterparts have very much taken the resolution to heart, he says.\\n\\nSzubin, who visited Beijing this week, says the new sanctions will hit hard enough to change Pyongyang's decision-making calculus.\\n\\nThe new U.N. resolution is not just adding a few new companies to a sanctions list or a few new North Korean officials, Szubin says. Instead, it targets every major aspect of North Korea's access to international shipping, international banking [and] international trade to develop revenues for its missile and illicit nuclear programs.\\n\\nAlthough China appears committed, the sanctions put it in a tough spot.\\n\\nFirst, says People's University international relations expert Cheng Xiaohe, some Chinese companies are going to take a hit to their bottom line. China-North Korea trade was worth $6.86 billion in 2014.\\n\\nAt the same time as we protect our national security interests, we must be prepared to sacrifice some of our own economic interests in order to accurately target North Korea with sanctions, he says.\\n\\nCheng says the U.S. has its work cut out for it, collecting intelligence on the hundreds of Chinese firms doing business with North Korea, and on North Korean firms adept at concealing their business dealings behind fronts and shells.\\n\\nAnd if Chinese firms are found to be violating the U.N. resolution, Cheng points out, they could themselves face sanctions.\\n\\nThis could create new frictions between the U.S. and China, he warns. I hope that the U.S. will think carefully before it uses this big stick to crack down on Chinese firms.\\n\\nCheng notes that China continues to supply North Korea with crude oil as humanitarian assistance. The sanctions allow this, even if North Korea may be able to refine some of the oil for military uses.\\n\\nChina says neither a humanitarian crisis nor regime collapse are acceptable outcomes for North Korea. But Zhang Liangui, a veteran North Korea watcher at China's Central Party School in Beijing, says that at the end of the day, China cannot save North Korea from its fate.\\n\\nIf North Korea is going to collapse, he says, no external force can prop it up. Frankly speaking, whether it collapses or continues to develop will mainly depend on its own domestic and foreign policies.\\n\\nNorth Korea's most recent nuclear test has put Beijing on the back foot, undermining its diplomatic ties with Seoul and raising the possibility that the U.S. could install missile defense systems in South Korea.\\n\\nCheng Xiaohe says Beijing doesn't like this — but there's not much it can do.\\n\\nChina has neither the ability nor the political will to give South Korea the security guarantees it seeks, he says. But the U.S. does.\\n\\nThe setbacks have led some Chinese observers to wonder, Has China's North Korea policy failed? — as the official People's Daily newspaper recently asked in an online headline.\\n\\nZhang Liangui says the possibility of failure is not one that Chinese diplomats dare admit. Then again, Zhang says, for the past two decades, no country has succeeded in keeping the Korean peninsula nuclear-free. North Korea's current suspected stockpile is estimated to include 10 to 16 nuclear weapons.\\n\\nThe way this situation has developed is a collective failure for all of us, he laments, a failure for the entire international community, including the United Nations."}
{"original": "Trump Orders Ban On Chinese Software Apps, Citing Potential Espionage\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump has signed an executive order banning business with several leading Chinese technology companies, claiming apps run by the companies have the ability to spy on Americans, including federal employees.\\n\\nTrump's order seeks to prohibit transactions with eight companies including Alipay, owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma; the payment platform on the popular app WeChat; and a Chinese messaging service called QQ owned by the Chinese tech giant Tencent.\\n\\nOther software apps included in the order are CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, VMate and WPS Office.\\n\\nIt's the latest push by the administration to clamp down on ascendant Chinese technology companies over fears that authorities in China could use the apps to spy on Americans.\\n\\nIn the order on Tuesday, the president suggested such software poses an unacceptable risk to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\\n\\n[By] accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information, the order says.\\n\\nNational security adviser Robert O'Brien praised the move on Tuesday, saying that all Chinese companies are required by the government to support the Communist Party's political objectives.\\n\\nChina's Military-Civil Fusion strategy explicitly aims to co-opt or coerce civilian enterprises into assisting the People's Liberation Army, O'Brien wrote.\\n\\nHe added that the order paves the way for developing a program to control the export of exploitable United States user data to foreign adversaries.\\n\\nBut with the mandate not going into effect for another 45 days — long after Trump's out of office — its actual implementation would require the buy-in of the incoming Biden administration. And that is not certain.\\n\\nA senior official with the Trump administration said in a briefing with reporters Tuesday night that the Biden administration had not been consulted in devising the far-reaching executive order.\\n\\nShould President-elect Joe Biden choose to move ahead with the bans, it is not likely to have a tremendous impact on U.S. consumers, who represent a fraction of the companies' customer base. Most users of the apps are Chinese citizens.\\n\\nEven so, the apps are increasingly crucial to U.S. businesses operating in China, with most having virtual storefronts tied into Alibaba/Alipay and WeChat.\\n\\nThe order does not take aim at video app TikTok, which is also owned by a Chinese company. Trump's attempt to put that app out of business over national security concerns has been blocked by multiple federal courts.\\n\\nStill, it is another attempt by the administration to crack down on foreign companies. Last month, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a list of Chinese and Russian companies with alleged military ties that bar them from buying a wide range of American goods and technology.\\n\\nChina has consistently denied claims that these companies share their data with the Chinese government and in response has retaliated by issuing its restrictions on exports of military technology."}
{"original": "Kenyan 'Wonk' Breaks Barriers As Student Body Prez At UNC\\n\\ntoggle caption Jason Beaubien/NPR\\n\\nHe wasn't sure he had the right name to run for student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\\n\\nHis first name was pretty ordinary — Bradley. But his last name is Opere — definitely not a familiar-sounding name in the U.S.\\n\\nYou have to have a white-sounding name to run for office, says Opere, a business major who's from Nairobi, Kenya. The ambitious 24-year-old ran anyway.\\n\\nAnd with his air of quiet confidence – and the skills he gained from two-years spent at the African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg — he won 53 percent of the vote.\\n\\nWalking across the campus at UNC, Opere in his dark blue blazer stands out amid a sea of Tarheels t-shirts and baggy sweatpants. I manage about 250 people every day, says Opere, who's now a senior, about his role as the head of student government at the prestigious public university.\\n\\nOpere has quickly become comfortable with the lingo of American college life. He trash talks UNC's archrival Duke University. He's developed an appreciation for basketball and football.\\n\\nUNC is doing really well this football season — if we have to call it football, he says.\\n\\nLike many Africans, Opere is a big fan of the other type of football and even plays on an intramural team at UNC.\\n\\nI play soccer a lot. I'm a midfielder, an attacking midfielder, he adds.\\n\\nHe's also learned a lot about how race in America is very different than in his homeland.\\n\\nYou know you look at race when you grow up in Kenya purely from a colonialism perspective, he says. It's historical.\\n\\nThen he went to post-apartheid South Africa where the sting of the racist apartheid system is still raw and present.\\n\\nIn South Africa it [race] is staring at you. You could clearly see it with the economic differences across different places.\\n\\nThen he landed in North Carolina.\\n\\nYou quickly learn that you've become black [in the U.S.], which isn't really an experience that you get when you are in predominantly black countries like South Africa or Kenya, he says with a laugh.\\n\\nHis stint at the African Leadership Academy, which aims to train the next generation of African leaders, was a turning point.\\n\\nI'd finished high school in Kenya. I got really good grades and I just didn't have any joy off of that, he says. He was antsy and looking for a new direction. I was reading about a school in South Africa and they said they want to develop the next generation of African leaders and I thought that's something that not a lot of schools are saying their vision wants to be.\\n\\nThe two-year private prep school has a pan-African focus, seeking to train African leaders to tackle Africa's biggest challenges. The curriculum is heavy on entrepreneurship, African politics and African history.\\n\\nThe school has a hefty price tag of $30,000 a year although it offers a lot of financial aid — and a loan forgiveness program for alumni who commit to live in Africa after college.\\n\\nOpere says he'd go back whether his loans were forgiven or not. He wants to make an impact on his home continent.\\n\\nThe American dream isn't there for billions of other people all over the world, he says. As much as life may be good here, easier here, there are other areas that also need to develop as much, leap as much and that are also beautiful in their own different ways.\\n\\nThe campaign at UNC was Opere's second run for student body president. At the African Leadership Academy, he was elected the head of student government.\\n\\nHis rival in the race at the ALA, Goodman Lepota, is now studying at Marist College in New York. When Lepota heard that Opere was running at UNC, he volunteered to be Opere's campaign strategist from 600 miles away.\\n\\nLepota, who grew up in an impoverished township in Johannesburg, affectionately calls Opere a wonk.\\n\\nHe focuses on policy details, Lepota says. I remember when he was at ALA he created an honor council and he spent the entire summer drafting how the honor council was going to operate.\\n\\nOpere wanted the honor council to serve as a forum to resolve disciplinary issues that previously had been handled by the dean's office.\\n\\nA lot of people were either getting expelled from school or getting in a lot of trouble, Lepota says. And he felt the students could take the responsibility to discipline themselves.\\n\\nOpere has a lot of ideas about what he might do after UNC — maybe work as a diplomat or go in to business or possibly stay in politics. What he is clear on is that he wants to return home to be part of what he calls a wave of change in Africa."}
{"original": "Israel To Start Vaccinating Palestinian Prisoners Next Week\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\\n\\nIsrael's health minister announced Thursday the country would vaccinate Palestinian prisoners against COVID-19, after Israel's president said withholding vaccines was against Israel's Jewish and democratic values.\\n\\nHealth Minister Yuli Edelstein said the prisoners would be vaccinated early next week, on Monday or Tuesday. The minister informed NPR of the decision before making a public announcement.\\n\\nThe decision comes amid a larger debate about whether Israel, which is leading the world in vaccinations per capita, should ensure vaccines for the Palestinian public in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, which is blockaded by Israel and Egypt.\\n\\nAbout 4,700 Palestinian detainees and prisoners are held in Israeli facilities, accused or convicted of crimes ranging from entering Israel illegally to attacking and killing Israelis.\\n\\nPalestinian prisoners have contracted the coronavirus, including 30 in a single prison who tested positive Thursday, Israel Prison Services spokeswoman Hana Herbst tells NPR.\\n\\nIn this case, you're talking about terrorists, but also other criminals, Edelstein says. There are lots of people together 24/7, and as we all know, this kind of situation sometimes leads to infection.\\n\\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross and rights groups have repeatedly called on Israel to vaccinate Palestinian inmates. But in late December, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, who is in charge of prisons, instructed prison officials not to do so.\\n\\nOhana reportedly objected to vaccinating Palestinian prisoners convicted of attacks on Israelis. He instructed only prison staff to be vaccinated for the time being, excluding all Israeli and Palestinian prisoners, Herbst says.\\n\\nHuman rights groups petitioned Israel's Supreme Court to reverse the ban on Palestinian prisoners. On Monday, Israel's defense minister also called for vaccination of prisoners. On Thursday, President Reuven Rivlin urged the health minister to vaccinate all prisoners.\\n\\nPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison — whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention before reaching a verdict — is inconsistent with our values, the values of the Jewish and democratic state, Rivlin wrote in a letter to Edelstein.\\n\\nIsrael has vaccinated a larger share of its population than than any other country. About 20% of the population — including Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem — has been vaccinated.\\n\\nEdelstein says Israel has also provided vaccines for about 100 Palestinian medical workers in the West Bank. The Palestinian Health Ministry says it requested vaccines for its medical workers but denies Israel supplied any.\\n\\nIsrael is not providing vaccines to the Palestinian public in the West Bank and Gaza.\\n\\nThe normal policy of every country is to vaccinate its own citizens. That's what they pay taxes for, Edelstein said.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the Palestinian Authority signed its own deals to receive vaccines for the West Bank and Gaza from a World Health Organization program, as well as from Russia, AstraZeneca and other drugmakers. Vaccines are expected to arrive in the Palestinian territories in the coming months."}
{"original": "Biden Leads In Virginia Poll Ahead Of Super Tuesday, Edges Past Sanders, Bloomberg\\n\\ntoggle caption Daniella Cheslow/WAMU\\n\\nUpdated at 12:56 p.m.\\n\\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine (D) endorsed Joe Biden on Friday in his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The hefty lift, just days before Super Tuesday, comes as a new poll shows the former vice president with a slight lead in Virginia, ahead of rivals Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.\\n\\nKaine, the former governor of Virginia and Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016, took aim at President Trump in his endorsement of Biden, writing, We deserve better in the Oval Office.\\n\\nAmerica is afflicted by a President who delights in division, cruelty, lies, and chaos. We deserve better in the Oval Office. In Virginia's primary, I will proudly vote for @JoeBiden. Joe has exemplary heart, character, and experience—and he's a leader our kids can look up to. — Tim Kaine (@timkaine) February 28, 2020\\n\\nBiden has received endorsements from a handful of other prominent Democrats in Virginia, including U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin and Rep. Elaine Luria.\\n\\nKaine's endorsement came shortly after a poll by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University showed Biden gaining 22% of likely voters in the Democratic primary. That's four points higher than Biden scored in a Feb. 18 poll conducted by Monmouth University. Sanders declined in support to 17%, but is still close behind. Bloomberg, meanwhile, slid to 13%; he and Sanders had previously been tied in first place.\\n\\nStill, Biden faces an uphill battle, particularly as Bloomberg threatens to attract notable support, potentially tipping the scales toward Sanders.\\n\\nWere going to see a pretty competitive contest at the top three, Biden, Sanders and Bloomberg, said poll co-author Rachel Bitecofer, Assistant Director of the Wason Center. There's potential for Bloomberg to pull enough votes from Biden, or vice versa, that Sanders could thread the needle.\\n\\nFormer South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren each earned 8% of likely primary voters in the poll. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar had 5% and billionaire Tom Steyer 1%. The remaining voters said they were undecided or chose another candidate.\\n\\nThe poll surveyed 866 registered voters, including 561 likely primary voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.\\n\\nAuthors of the poll caution that it was conducted throughout the month of February, a tumultuous month of campaigning, debates and early primary contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Biden placed poorly in those early states, trounced by Sanders and Buttigieg. Polling ahead of South Carolina's Saturday primary shows Biden could reverse his losses; he leads there by double digits, fueled by strong support from African American voters.\\n\\nAmeshia Cross, a Democratic strategist who served in the Obama administration, said Virginia's political dynamics hue closely to South Carolina's.\\n\\nConsidering the diverse landscape of Virginia and the strong Black caucus leadership and advocacy there, the latest poll numbers aren't surprising, Cross wrote to WAMU in an email. Virginia voters are pragmatic, realistic and want to carry the nation. Many don't see Democratic socialism as a winning policy ideology specifically for downballot races and maintaining the seats moderates won in Trump districts in the midterms.\\n\\nPoll co-author Bitecofer said Bloomberg has altered the playing field.\\n\\nBecause Bloomberg suddenly enters this race and appears to be competitive in it, I really don't think that Biden can win South Carolina and suddenly win the nomination, Bitecofer said. I think the party faces a real problem ... It's quite possible that Sanders will become the nominee because the moderate flank is divided between two candidates.\\n\\nAlthough Biden secured the most prominent endorsements in Virginia, the state's black leadership and the wider party have no clear favorite. Various members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Biden, Bloomberg and Warren; and all six top presidential contenders have garnered endorsements from state lawmakers in the General Assembly. Congressman Don Beyer supports Buttigieg, comparing him to former President Obama at a recent rally in Arlington.\\n\\nVirginia will send 99 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, fewer than heavyweight states like California and Texas. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is seen as an important indicator ahead of presidential elections and is a key campaign stop for candidates. Bloomberg announced a Saturday morning event in Manassas, Sanders was set to rally Saturday afternoon in Leesburg, and Biden said he would meet supporters in Norfolk. Klobuchar planned to speak Friday in Falls Church. Buttigieg and Warren also made earlier February stops in Virginia.\\n\\nThe early contests give Sanders 45 of the delegates to Biden's 15. Biden will likely narrow that gap in South Carolina Saturday, but Super Tuesday could shift the landscape once more. With 14 states voting, Tuesday's primaries will determine how a full third of delegates to the Democratic National Convention will vote in July.\\n\\nThe Friday poll revealed that voters in Virginia continue to support tighter gun control, legalization of marijuana and expanding access to healthcare. However, Bitecofer said she noticed those positions were tempered. A full 60% of respondents, support maintaining the current system of private health care insurance. Cancelling all student debt was popular among just 15% of voters.\\n\\nI saw a preference for moderation and centrism in the policy preferences of the issues that I tested that are being talked about in the Democratic primary, Bitecofer said. Medicare for all and student loan forgiveness, for example, the preference for Virginia voters are modest reforms, not the full monty that the Sanders campaign is offering.\\n\\nThe poll found Virginia primary voters evenly split on whether they valued electability or agreement on issues, which Bitecofer said was surprising given that Sanders polls at 17%. If there were only one moderate candidate, she said, that person would likely far outpoll him.\\n\\nWhomever Democrats choose, Virginians surveyed appeared unlikely to vote for Trump. In the Wason Center poll, 59% of voters said they would choose someone else over Trump, and 82% said they would support the eventual nominee in the general election.\\n\\nDespite deep red southern and rural areas, Virginia will likely be a challenge for Trump in November; Obama won twice in Virginia, and Clinton took the state by more than five points in 2016. Over the past three years, the state has continued to shift blue, with Democrats claiming the governor's office and flipping both chambers of the General Assembly. The change is most pronounced in the Northern Virginia suburbs, where onetime Republican strongholds have turned into Democratic bastions.\\n\\nAt a steakhouse in McLean this week, ads for Bloomberg played on large TV screens mounted above the bar. Marc Steckel, a retired federal employee, said in 2016 he voted against Republicans for the first time, choosing a third-party candidate. Steckel, 63, said if he votes in the primary, he will likely pick Klobuchar. He said in November, he would support any Democratic nominee against Trump – except Sanders.\\n\\nJust can't do it, Steckel said. I'm afraid he'll turn this country into Venezuela.\\n\\nSteckel said he was particularly concerned that public health insurance and other Sanders ideas would raise taxes for his children.\\n\\nHair stylist Rebekah Harrington, 30, said she voted for Republican presidential candidates until 2016, when she sat out the election. Ahead of Super Tuesday, Harrington said she was watching debates closely and favored Buttigieg and Steyer for their environmental programs. However, she wanted primarily to send a signal against the current occupant of the White House.\\n\\nI'm upset enough with Trump and the Republican party that I just want something that's not that, she said."}
{"original": "U.S. Steel Says China Is Using Cyber Stealth To Steal Its Secrets\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption STR/AFP/Getty Images STR/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nInternational trade disputes used to be relatively simple.\\n\\nOne country would build up an industry to create jobs, and then dump excess products in another country at below-cost prices. Competitors facing unrealistically cheap imports would file anti-dumping complaints to seek government-backed protections.\\n\\nThat's what happened decades ago when U.S. steel companies got fed up with Japanese makers of steel pipe. In 1978, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued a cease and desist order to stop Japan's predatory pricing.\\n\\nAh, but those were simpler times.\\n\\nThis week, U.S. Steel Corp. filed a trade complaint with the ITC, starting off with a traditional pricing complaint: The Chinese industry has formed a cartel that sets purchase and sale prices, and controls production and export volumes to target export markets.\\n\\nBut then it added a 21st century twist: The Chinese industry has used its government to steal U.S. Steel's closely guarded trade secrets and uses those trade secrets to produce advanced steel products it could not make on its own.\\n\\nThe Pittsburgh-based steelmaker says its Chinese rivals must be investigated. We will use every tool available to fight for fair trade, U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi said in a statement.\\n\\nThe complaint was filed with the independent agency charged with reviewing complaints and enforcing U.S. trade policy. It has 30 days to decide whether to investigate charges; usually, it says yes.\\n\\nChina's Commerce Ministry said that the complaints have no factual basis, and it urged the ITC to reject U.S. Steel's case.\\n\\nU.S. Steel's tough language may add to the rising trade tensions between China and other major steel-producing nations. The U.S. government already has hit Chinese steel imports with new duties this year, and it has launched an investigation into China's alleged overproduction of aluminum.\\n\\nLast week, officials from the U.S., Europe, Japan and other steel-producing nations met in Brussels to push for a multinational, comprehensive agreement to cut steelmaking capacity. But China wouldn't go along with such plans.\\n\\nSo now U.S. Steel says it is pursuing countervailing and anti-dumping cases and pushing for increased enforcement of existing laws.\\n\\nAmerican steel companies are agitated about China because they already are facing lots of problems. For example, tighter fuel standards are pushing car makers to switch to lighter materials. And energy companies are buying a lot less pipe for drilling.\\n\\nSo U.S. companies want to focus on more advanced products, such as high-strength stainless steels. But changing over to making new types of steel is expensive. Having competitors hack into — and steal — valuable research would be very damaging.\\n\\nIn its public complaint, U.S. Steel did not provide evidence of hacking by Chinese officials, but said a 2011 hack fit the pattern of previous attacks that the Chinese government conducted to benefit their state-owned companies. The attack circumvented the technological safeguards U.S. Steel uses to protect its trade secrets, and stole several gigabytes of valuable research data on advanced steels.\\n\\nIf the ITC decides to go forward, the investigation may take a while. That's because the agency is being asked to, in effect, weigh three separate issues: price fixing, false labeling to avoid duties and theft of trade secrets.\\n\\nDerek Scissors, a resident scholar and China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while U.S. Steel has not yet presented public evidence, it would be no surprise if China turned up guilty of hacking.\\n\\nWhen it comes to stealing trade secrets, they do it all the time, Scissors said. There's no defense for such behavior, he added.\\n\\nScissors says U.S. Steel also probably would be able to prove that China is flooding markets with cheap steel. They have too much [steelmaking] capacity and it looks like dumping, he said of the import surge. However, he pointed out that cheap steel helps other U.S. manufacturers hold down the cost of goods made with steel — like autos.\\n\\nIt's not necessarily bad for the country, he said of Chinese steel. Ford benefits from dumped steel."}
{"original": "U.S. Prosecutors Sue To Stop Nation's First Supervised Injection Site For Opioids\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Emma Lee/WHYY Emma Lee/WHYY\\n\\nAfter months of threats, federal prosecutors in Philadelphia launched a legal challenge on Wednesday against the nonprofit Safehouse, which is hoping to open what could be the nation's first site where people with opioid addiction can use drugs under medical supervision.\\n\\nThe civil lawsuit, which is jointly being pursued by Pennsylvania-based prosecutors and the Department of Justice in Washington, is the first time the federal government has intervened in the hotly debated issue of supervised injection sites. The lawsuit could become an important legal test case as about a dozen cities across the country consider similar proposals.\\n\\nThe suit comes just as Safehouse officials ramp up fundraising efforts and continue to scout a location for what they say is a medical facility that can save lives.\\n\\nIf federal officials succeed in court, the momentum behind Safehouse may be lost.\\n\\nThis is in-your-face illegal activity using some of the most deadly, dangerous drugs that are on the streets. We have a responsibility to step in, says William McSwain, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It's saying, 'Safehouse, we think this is illegal. Stop what you're doing.' \\n\\nAccording to the suit, a supervised injection site would violate a section added to the Controlled Substances Act in the 1980s during the height of the crack epidemic. That section of law was written to close crack houses, but legal experts say it has been used more expansively in the past.\\n\\nMcSwain's comments affirm remarks made last year by Rod Rosenstein, deputy U.S. attorney general, who said in an interview with WHYY that swift and aggressive action would follow the opening of a supervised injection site. Such facilities operate in Canada and Europe, but none exist in the United States. That has not stopped other cities like New York, Denver and Seattle from publicly debating similar proposals.\\n\\nIn Philadelphia, the one-count civil lawsuit is far from the most assertive posture federal prosecutors could have taken, McSwain says.\\n\\nThe suit is asking U.S. District Court Judge Gerald McHugh to rule on the legality of Safehouse's plans, rather than waiting for Safehouse to open and then cracking down with arrests and a prosecution.\\n\\nWe're not bringing a criminal case right now. We're not arresting anybody. We're not asking to forfeit property. We're not looking to be heavy-handed, McSwain says. This can serve everyone's interest, in order to find out what the court thinks of this. But this, in our view, is illegal.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\\n\\nRonda Goldfein, vice president and attorney for Safehouse, says federal drug laws were not written to obstruct a medical facility focused on saving lives and moving people who are addicted to opioids into treatment.\\n\\nShe is confident the court will rule in Safehouse's favor.\\n\\nWe have a disagreement on the analysis and intention of the law, Goldfein says. We don't think it was intended to prevent activities such as this, and perhaps it will take a court's ruling to move the issue forward.\\n\\nThe provision of the law in question is widely known as the crack house statute. It makes it illegal to maintain a space for the purpose of making, storing, distributing or using an illegal drug. Safehouse would not make or provide opioids to users. But it would allow people to bring in their own drugs, to use while being monitored by medical staff.\\n\\nA study by Alex Kreit, a drug policy specialist and law professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, found that the law has been successfully used by prosecutors in situations that include a drug seller operating out of a car dealership; rave parties where ecstasy was prevalent; and a concert promoter who threw jam band music festivals where illegal drugs flowed freely.\\n\\nKreit says that while the language of the Controlled Substances Act is broad enough to encompass an injection site, he can also imagine a defense based on local conviction about the need for such a medical service gaining traction in the face of the opioid crisis. But he says winning with that pitch would be an uphill battle in federal court.\\n\\nIt is completely untested in terms of how federal law will apply to safe injection sites, Kreit says. People will be watching this very closely — particularly in other cities that have expressed their intention of starting a safe injection site.\\n\\nSafehouse is a privately run nonprofit that has the support of top city officials but will not be receiving any taxpayer funding. Planners say they aspire to open a facility in 2019, though, at least publicly, they have not committed to a more specific timeline.\\n\\nPhiladelphia health officials estimate that opioid-related drug overdoses kill about three people a day in the city. The more than 1,100 people who died from an overdose last year is triple the murder rate.\\n\\nThe overdose mortality rate hit a five-year low last year, and city officials attribute the decline to the distribution of naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan. Transit workers, police and paramedics now all are equipped with the overdose-reversing drug.\\n\\nStudies have shown that in Canada and Europe, supervised injection sites have curbed the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases. And the programs have been credited with averting lethal overdoses and extending a link to treatment services.\\n\\nMcSwain, though, remains a skeptic.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean that you're not going to overdose when you're not at the site. And it doesn't mean that there couldn't be other negative effects of having a site, where more people are, for example, getting hooked on drugs or trying drugs, because they think it's safe, or they think it's legitimate or they think it's legal, McSwain says. We don't attract people to go down this path of drug dependency that destroys their lives.\\n\\nMcSwain says there is no evidence that such a model would definitively work in Philadelphia. He worries an injection site would normalize or even entice people to use unpredictable synthetic opioids like fentanyl — a drug that can be 50 times as powerful as heroin.\\n\\nIn November, McSwain wrote Safehouse officials a letter imploring the nonprofit to comply with federal law, writing that the federal statute makes no exception for entities, such as Safehouse, who claim a benevolent purpose.\\n\\nIn response, Safehouse officials told McSwain they respectfully disagree that the injection site would violate federal law, since the statutes were never intended to be used to attack a medical injection site.\\n\\nWe hope that the U.S. Attorney's office will exercise prosecutorial discretion in assessing our proposed overdose prevention services, Goldfein wrote.\\n\\nThree months later, federal officials took Safehouse to court.\\n\\nThese folks have good intentions and they're trying their best to combat the opioid epidemic, McSwain says, but this step of opening an injection site crosses the line. If Safehouse or others want to open this type of site, they need to steer their efforts to get the law changed.\\n\\nThis story comes from Keystone Crossroads, a statewide public media initiative reporting on cities across Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "In 'Service,' A Celebrated Photographer Turns His Lens On U.S. Troops\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nAs a celebrated portrait photographer, Platon Antoniou (who goes professionally by his first name) is well-known for his close-up depictions of the powerful. He has aimed his camera at the faces of celebrities and world leaders ranging from Vladimir Putin and Moammar Gadhafi to Willie Nelson and Woody Allen.\\n\\nSometimes, he says, you look in their eyes and you see angels. And sometimes you see demons.\\n\\nPlaton's 2011 book, Power, featured photos of more than 100 world leaders. In Service (Prestel Publishing), the British-born photographer turns his lens on U.S. military personnel and their loved ones.\\n\\nCourtesy of Prestel\\n\\nI have a rather strange perspective on the times we're living in, he says, because I've had very intimate moments with heads of state, and yet I've also had these very powerful moments with the people who have to play out the policies that our leaders put forward. It leaves me as someone in the middle.\\n\\nThe book results from a project that began back in 2008, an assignment Platon took on after he was appointed as Richard Avedon's successor as staff photographer at the New Yorker. (He now dedicates much of his time to The People's Portfolio, a nonprofit organization he founded to highlight underreported stories around the world.)\\n\\nFirst, he spent time with troops while they trained in a simulated Iraqi village at the U.S. Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin in the Mojave Desert, before they were deployed. Then he waited for them to return. When it was possible, he photographed them again — or the loved ones who survived them.\\n\\nI had done so many portraits of leaders, he says. And what is great leadership? We have seen it being about confidence, charisma, strength, decision-making. We all know that side. But there's another side that's far more complicated — that's the idea of service. I wanted to find out what happens when you're asked to do something and you do it — and it's very dangerous, and the sacrifices you make. This is where I learned about the other side of leadership, which is service.\\n\\nIn the waning weeks of the 2008 presidential campaign, the New Yorker published several of Platon's images. One, showing a grieving mother at Arlington Cemetery embracing the headstone of her son — a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq — caught the eye of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who highlighted it as he announced his endorsement of Barack Obama, who he hoped would be a unifying figure as U.S. president.\\n\\nThe picture of the mother is the big question of our time: What is it to be American, to be patriotic, to give good service? Platon says. Unfortunately, the reason why the [image of the] mother was so powerful — that terrain is even more heightened now. I'm left with this sadness. Did we learn nothing?\\n\\nWhat did you first set out to do in this project?\\n\\nWe had an election coming, as we do now. We had this idea: How do we do a large-scale photo essay that provokes and stimulates respectful debate? I was interested in looking at poverty in America, but other issues came up and the U.S. military was one of them.\\n\\nWe focused on America's role militarily, and slowly, it morphed into this idea of service — it became less about war and was more about the human story behind the war. We wanted to avoid politics. We had this idea not to photograph anyone famous. This is really about ordinary men and women and families who all give great service. It was certainly an emotional roller coaster and it pushed me so far.\\n\\nDescribe the training camp you spent time in.\\n\\nIt's 100 square miles in California, in the desert, where they built Iraq. [The simulated Iraqi village] was called Medina Wasl. The soldiers called it The Suck. They were sent there for the last two weeks before deployment to really get their heads in the zone. There's tanks tipped over on fire. All the signs are in Arabic. They had a Humvee which was exploded five times a day on routine patrols with IED explosives. It was more and more disfigured as the demonstrations continued.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Platon Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nYou feel like you're in Iraq; it's 105 degrees. [The soldiers] are ambushed by role-playing terrorists; people are screaming. They use amputee role players coming out screaming, holding part of their foot.\\n\\nI was allowed to photograph all this. I built a small studio and invited [people] in.\\n\\nThey called this street [at the camp] Trauma Lane, and that was the working title of the book for a long time. As the project shifted to the return home, I realized there was something more than just trauma here. There was tenderness, feelings, love and compassion. So it shifted to something more universal, which became Service.\\n\\nThe conditions sound challenging, not your usual studio photography.\\n\\nIt was a godforsaken place. I've never been to war; I've never experienced anything like that. I was suddenly put in this hellhole of a place, and that wasn't even the real thing. It felt a bit like Apocalypse Now. Things start to get a bit warped. The Hasselblad, the camera I use, has this leather on the side glued onto the metal, and it was so hot, the glue was melting. All the casing started to come off.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nWe worked 15-hour days in the heat for four or five days. There was nowhere to shower. At night, you could hear explosions going off, but after awhile you'd fall asleep because you were exhausted.\\n\\nYou had a rude awakening one night, right?\\n\\nI remember I felt this pressure between my eyes, and I woke up and there was a gun — I don't know what kind of gun because I'm not a gun kind of guy — but it was one of these machine gun things pointing right between my eyes, with night vision. The guy looked like some version of Robocop — I nearly had a heart attack. He just whispers as he presses the barrel more and more into my flesh, Don't. Move.\\n\\nIt was a [simulated] nighttime patrol mission. I just lay there. He steps over me and just carries on walking. I wanted to say, But I'm a New Yorker photographer! I'm just here doing portraits! But obviously you daren't speak.\\n\\nI actually found the guy who did it the next day. I wanted to show everyone what it felt like — Would you help me do that? He said sure. And he points the gun right at the camera. It's not the same, because [originally] it was nighttime and I was half-asleep. But the feeling of that giant looming over you with perspective, the gun literally coming into your face, was the nearest I could get to it as a portrait photographer.\\n\\nYou met some of the soldiers when they returned.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nYes, they were deployed. Then they come back and it's all different. I waited with the families. I waited with this young lady [Beth Pisarsky]. The Humvee pulls up, [Airman 1st Class Christopher Wilson] steps out, and when these guys come back, they are built like rock — not just physically, but emotionally.\\n\\n[Pisarsky] charged at him like a team of wild horses and almost knocked him over. And it was almost like an attack of love. I remember having to tilt the camera because I wasn't expecting it, it surprised me. It was the beginning of emotion — now I'm not just seeing a sense of bravado, I'm now seeing what did it take to be a good servant. What price did you have to pay? You know he's come back different.\\n\\nThere's another shot of a soldier hugging [a loved one] and there's a tear rolling down his face that isn't just happiness. It's complicated. And from now on, it's going to be really complicated. He's seen things you can't unsee. And she hasn't. But she's experienced that they had a relationship that's now going to be fundamentally changed.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Platon Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nSo it became really human. It stopped being about the military and war, and turned into this human story that I never really expected it to be. I ended up taking pictures of love in the second half of the book.\\n\\nTell me about the portraits you shot at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\\n\\nI did a portrait of [Jacquelyne Kay] with her arms around [husband Sgt. Tim Johannsen] in a wheelchair. And it became what I saw as this transference of power. She's his wife and saying, I've got him home now, no one is going to hurt him anymore. The picture is divided into two halves. I remember thinking consciously, do I show his legs cut off? Maybe I should be more sanitized about it. Then I thought, no. You have to acknowledge both — the love and tenderness, and the brutality, danger, pain and trauma that's also there.\\n\\nHe closed his eyes in her embrace. It was the most powerful thing. For him to show a sense of vulnerability, it made him all the more tough for me.\\n\\nYou also photographed people grieving in Arlington Cemetery.\\n\\nI was photographing many bereaved families I had appointments with. And I was dreading that day. I was worn down. I also read the weather reports and they said in D.C., there were going to be terrible thunderstorms and wind and rain. I use strobe lights, it's a whole operation, and on top of that, I'm dealing with the most acute sensitivities you can imagine. I am literally treading on sacred ground here. I was really nervous.\\n\\nAs the rain faded away, I noticed at the far corner of the cemetery a woman I didn't have an appointment with. She brings a foldout picnic chair and would sit and read [at her son's grave] every day. It was such a powerful and tender thing to witness. The dialogue between mother and son continues even after his passing. I went over and asked permission to take her picture.\\n\\nShe puts the book at the bottom of the headstone and goes behind it and cuddles the headstone as if she is cuddling her son. And then she closed her eyes. I was standing on the wet ground, where her son is buried, and I was so aware of the delicacies of my body language, and I was really looking at her face and hands and her mannerisms. I had no extra attention left over to notice that the book was the Quran or that the name on the headstone was a Muslim name. I thanked her and asked her name and she said, Elsheba Khan. I still didn't think.\\n\\nI took the pictures back to the magazine. When we were doing the edits, it was [New Yorker Editor] David Remnick who said, Look at that. We thought, Oh my goodness. We ran it in the photo essay with all the other pictures [in September 2008].\\n\\nAnd shortly thereafter, that photo came up when former Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed Obama for president on Meet the Press. He warned against divisiveness and said, I feel strongly about this particular point because of a picture I saw in a magazine.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went on to describe exactly my picture. I'm sitting there with my mouth open.\\n\\nThat picture was described as a game changer, but it was not [a photo] of anyone powerful. I had worked with all the power players. But it wasn't any of those that shifted people's hearts and minds. It was an ordinary person, dealing with the one thing we have in common — we all love and lose. We're all united by that. I received a letter from [Powell] that said, thank you for showing me in a very painful way what America really is all about.\\n\\nUnlike the celebrities and power players you've photographed, here you were dealing with people often in a state of vulnerability. How did you establish trust with them?\\n\\nIt's the difficult question — how do you do that? I wish I had a gimmick; I wish I had a trick. Trust means you have to be courageous first, with all your emotions open and so respectful and humble that there's no room for your ego in this space. I am your servant and I am here to tell the world what happened to you. I can't do it alone. I need you to be courageous with me. And if you really mean it, if you're 100 percent committed, you can't bulls*** that. You can't fake it. It's called authenticity.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nAnd of course, that's very traumatic. It's very traumatic for me. Before a shoot, I don't have a storyboard. I don't know whether this person will be angry at the world — or maybe at me — or if they will break, how to deal with vulnerability. You have to be ready for the whole human condition to play out. You go in so raw. You just have to make very quick emotional decisions.\\n\\nAnd sometimes I get it wrong.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nI went to a lady's house. Her name is Jessica [Gray]. Her husband wrote an op-ed criticizing America's policy. Shortly after that, he was killed in Iraq. They'd recently had a little girl.\\n\\nI'm setting up my studio in her living room. I'm dealing with a woman's pain and courage, facing a new life that's going to be difficult. That becomes consuming. I saw the flag they'd draped over his coffin and I said, Would you be prepared to hold the flag? She said of course and took the flag out of the box.\\n\\nI asked her, how would you feel wearing a piece of his clothing in tribute to him? She said, that's a good idea. She had received a box of his clothing, it was at the base of the bed but she had not yet had the courage to open it. All his clothes, his Army T-shirts were in the box. She said, maybe now is the time to open it.\\n\\nAnd then I thought, oh — what am I doing here?\\n\\nShe undid one latch. I undid the other. And as she lifted the lid, she burst into tears.\\n\\nI felt so ashamed. I really blew it. I thought, for the sake of a photograph, you went too far. I said, I feel so ashamed. I didn't want to hurt you. Let's not do this. This was a bad idea.\\n\\nShe said, You don't know why I'm crying. I've just realized they washed his clothes and I wanted to smell him again. She said, The pain is there whether I open the box or not. Now the box is open and I think I would like to wear his T-shirt.\\n\\nThis is not the look of a victim. This is the look of a woman trying to pull all her strength together to face the future.\\n\\nHave you stayed in touch with Jessica Gray or any of the other people you photographed for this project?\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Platon\\n\\nMost were deployed; a few I did have some contact with. In putting together the book, in some cases, I found out some passed away or changed completely. I very rarely seek to have a friendship with the people I work with. Sometimes it happens accidentally. All my attention and affection goes into the work. And my subject knows that. When I'm actually taking the picture, that's the moment. I know there's a good chance I'll never see this person again.\\n\\nI've done some emotional projects before, but not at this relentless pace, day after day. The way I work is, I'm very subjective. I'm not the objective journalist who doesn't get involved. I'm not the observer. How the hell can you be objective when you're in a widow's house and she's standing there in front of you and she's crying? You can't. You're in. You find yourself becoming part of the story in a weird way.\\n\\nThe picture is a complete collaboration between me and the sitter. There's no stolen moment. It's a discussion — a visual lesson they are teaching me about life, and I'm just learning it and recording my lessons on film.\\n\\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.

{"original": "A Trump Spokesman On The Administration's Ukraine Policy\\n\\nAs Presdent Trump's lawyers prepare make their case in the Senate impeachment trial, NPR's Scott Simon speaks with Steven Groves, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nHouse managers presented their case to remove President Trump from office this week. They contend he abused his powers by pressuring Ukraine to provide damaging information on Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress by refusing to provide testimony and documents. Today, the president's legal team began their defense of the president. We have a roundup of those arguments elsewhere in the program. But as the trial continues, we wanted to hear from the White House. So we spoke with Steven Groves, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary. Here's what he told us earlier today.\\n\\nYou were head of the Heritage Foundation's Freedom Project that worked to preserve and protect American sovereignty.\\n\\nSTEVEN GROVES: That's right.\\n\\nSIMON: So how do you feel about a U.S. president, who according to witnesses, invited a foreign government to influence U.S. elections?\\n\\nGROVES: Well, the only evidence - and I put scare quotes around the term evidence - of that is a comment that the president made during the 2016 race where he says, oh Russia if you're listening, you know, go and get those emails. But, of course, everybody wanted those e-mails....\\n\\nSIMON: I think it's...\\n\\nGROVES: So I think that - I think that the president is just fine with protecting American sovereignty and every action that he's taken since he's been president in the foreign sphere is to protect our sovereignty, so I have no qualms about that.\\n\\nSIMON: I think that - I think the testimony has been a great deal larger than that. Several diplomats have talked about the president's interest in stopping Ukraine aid in exchange for information which raises this question, does the president say he didn't pressure Ukraine by withholding aid to Congress that was approved - and it was withheld for a couple of months - or is his argument that he did, but that's just politics, it's not impeachable?\\n\\nGROVES: Well, his argument is going to be laid out ably by his attorneys in, I think, about 45 minutes so we'll hear directly from them. But the president's been perfectly clear...\\n\\nSIMON: Well, why don't you just tell us the truth? Why don't you just tell us the truth now?\\n\\nGROVES: Well, the truth will out and the president's attorneys are the ones that are going to present it to the American people and to the 100 members of the Senate. And their statements and their presentation will be based on the evidence, not on hearsay and speculation and inferences based on inferences. And the American people and the Senate will hear the president's defense.\\n\\nSIMON: Did the president, Mr. Groves, withhold aid from Congress in exchange - withhold aid from Ukraine, that was approved by Congress, in exchange for damaging information about a political rival?\\n\\nGROVES: No, he didn't, and there's been no evidence to the contrary. You've seen the transcript of the call. You've heard the Democrats case put forward by me...\\n\\nSIMON: Well I asked the question because we - we've seen the transcript of the call. And I ask the question because we've heard testimony from...\\n\\nGROVES: There is nothing in the transcript and the call and there is nothing in the transcript that said anything about withholding aid. There was nothing in the transcript that said anything about withholding a White House meeting.\\n\\nSIMON: But it was withheld.\\n\\nGROVES: There's nothing in the transcript that says so. There - President Zelenskiy has not been to the White House, but the meetings with the president were scheduled for Warsaw and then for the United Nations at the General Assembly where the president and President Zelenskiy did meet. So the White House - the meeting with the president was not held and there was nothing in the transcript that said so.\\n\\nSIMON: Mr. Groves, Secretary of State Pompeo is reportedly on his way to Ukraine next week, but he had an interview with one of my colleagues yesterday and asked, do you think Americans care about Ukraine? Does the Trump administration believe the American people don't care about Ukraine?\\n\\nGROVES: I don't know. I wasn't party to that conversation and apparently that was a conversation that happened behind closed doors, after your colleague interviewed Secretary Pompeo.\\n\\nSIMON: It's still on...\\n\\nGROVES: So if that's what we're going to do. If you're going to...\\n\\nSIMON: ...On the record.\\n\\nGROVES: ...Question me, sir. Sir, if you're going to question me about a conversation that the secretary of state had with one of your reporters...\\n\\nSIMON: No, no, no, I'm -\\n\\nGROVES: ...After their reporting, then we can have that conversation, sir.\\n\\nSIMON: Well I'm questioning you about the Trump administration's belief about Ukraine and whether or not the American people believe that you don't care about Ukraine. You don't have to refer to that conversation to answer the question.\\n\\nGROVES: Of course, the - well the American people care about Ukraine the same way they care about any other country. I think most Americans care a lot more about their own country, before what's happening in some other country.\\n\\nSIMON: Well, one last question if we can. There are recordings, of course, that are surfacing saying that President Trump said to get rid of her, about Ambassador Yovanovitch to people who weren't in the U.S. government. Why make that demand of people who weren't in the U.S. government? Does that suggest they had a role in Ukrainian policy?\\n\\nGROVES: Well, you should probably listen a little bit more closely to that recording and to Lev Parnas' explanation because he made it clear that President Trump's comment was made to Johnny DeStefano who was in charge of personnel at the time. So he wasn't telling Lev Parnas to fire Secretary Yovanovitch, so do a little bit more homework and then come back to me.\\n\\nSIMON: Steven Groves, Special Assistant to the president, Deputy Press Secretary.

{"original": "How Social Media Can Approach Free Speech During A Polarizing Time\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nAfter President Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter, right-wing social media platform Parler was booted off of Apple's App Store and Amazon's web-hosting services, effectively putting them both offline. Parler is suing Amazon. We should note that both Apple and Amazon are NPR underwriters.\\n\\nThese decisions followed last week's deadly attack at the U.S. Capitol launched by President Trump's extreme supporters and are applauded by many. But many also are concerned the actions might set a precedent for censoring free speech on social media.\\n\\nDaphne Keller, who is the Platform Regulation director at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, joins us now. Professor, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nDAPHNE KELLER: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nSIMON: First big question - do you consider these bans a violation of the First Amendment?\\n\\nKELLER: No, and I can't imagine a court considering them violations of the First Amendment either. There have been more than 30 lawsuits in the U.S. by users saying they have a right to speak on platforms and demanding that platforms reinstate them. And the platforms always win those cases. One big reason is because the First Amendment defines your rights against the government; it doesn't define rights against a private company.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah.\\n\\nKELLER: Another big reason is because the platforms themselves have their own First Amendment rights to set editorial policy and decide what to take down.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah. But at the same time, do you have some concerns about these platforms seeming to regulate speech? And I note that Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, said this week that he thought the ban on President Trump was right, but he's concerned that it might set a precedent.\\n\\nKELLER: You know, I think everyone has that concern. Everyone who pays attention is worried about the idea that a very small number of private companies exercise gatekeeper power over some of the most important forums for public discussion these days.\\n\\nSIMON: And we should note these are some of the same platforms that have complied with tyrannies in some countries that suppress speech, haven't they?\\n\\nKELLER: In some cases, yes. There's globalization that goes on where American platforms at one point were sort of net exporters of First Amendment values, and now they tend to be net importers of European speech rules. But there's a risk that they become importers of Chinese speech rules or Turkish speech rules.\\n\\nSIMON: How can social media companies and web-hosting services moderate or regulate racist and violent messages when a lot of the people who post them speak in a coded language?\\n\\nKELLER: Well, it's hard for a number of reasons. One reason is that we are very far from consensus among the American public about what speech platforms should be taking down. But then beyond that is the point that you raise in your question about, well, once they do set a policy, how can they tell when a new meme or a euphemism is in circulation? And part of the answer is that they employ people who are experts and following the research on this. And so hopefully, the big platforms who can afford to employ those people are relatively up to date.\\n\\nSIMON: What about the concerns some people have that - I'll cite an old example - that someone like Lenny Bruce wouldn't be able to be on these social media platforms now?\\n\\nKELLER: That is absolutely a concern. There's also a risk of the harm from taking down the wrong things falling disproportionately on certain groups - in particular, people of color, people who are not native English speakers. There are studies showing that when platforms rely on automation to figure out whose speech is hateful, they falsely penalize speakers of African American English more than everyone else. So it's not just a speech issue. There's an equality issue.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah.\\n\\nKELLER: There's also an economic issue with proposing rules that the giant platforms can afford to comply with but their smaller competitors cannot.\\n\\nSIMON: Let me cast back one last time to what Jack Dorsey of Twitter suggested this week. And to paraphrase him, he said, we took the step only reluctantly because we really do seek to be a worldwide platform for a free exchange of ideas all over the world, even ones that some people consider to be offensive. We have to be careful about this because this is the way that some national liberation groups - the only way that they can communicate with each other against a dictatorship.\\n\\nKELLER: I think it's something we all should pay attention to as we press for more takedowns of bad content - the risk that that will become a mechanism for silencing important public discourse. But also, I think they don't want to have to make decisions that will make half of the country very angry with them. Any shift that would let them outsource that decision and point the finger at somebody else, as Facebook is doing with the Facebook Oversight Board, I think they would be very happy to find that.\\n\\nSIMON: Are there some dangers as we become increasingly reliant for these platforms to carry national dialogue - is that instead of people talking to each other and exchanging different ideas, we're going to have everybody crawl under their favorite platform and exchange only ideas there?\\n\\nKELLER: Well, that is a risk in particular as we drive hateful speakers off of mainstream platforms where other people can respond to them and disagree with them into smaller and more marginalized, you know, echo chambers where they're going to hear only views that agree with theirs or views that are more radicalizing. That is one of the costs.\\n\\nSIMON: Daphne Keller, Platform Regulation director at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nKELLER: Thank you.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Experts Cast Doubt On What Else FBI Might Get From Suspect's iPhone\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe showdown between the FBI and Apple could result in huge changes for security and privacy, but one thing it may not do is deliver a big break in the San Bernardino case.\\n\\nInvestigators say they want to exhaust every avenue as they piece together what led to the Dec. 2 attack. That's why they've asked a court to order Apple to unlock an iPhone that belonged to Syed Farook, one of the shooters. Apple is refusing to cooperate.\\n\\nBeyond the larger battle of principle, however, skeptics wonder whether the FBI can learn much of value from Farook's phone.\\n\\nWe have to ask ourselves what they'll discover on the San Bernardino shooter's phone that they don't already have, said Susan Landau, a professor of Cybersecurity Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\\n\\nThey should already have the information on whom he called, and who called him; they can get that information from the metadata at the phone company, she said. In the same way, they can get some of the email data from his Internet service provider. So what they are really looking for is anything Farook might have saved on his phone — and you have to wonder what the value will be of that.\\n\\nInvestigators are concerned that Farook allegedly turned off the iCloud backup for the phone about a month before the attacks. That leads them to suspect Farook might have something saved on the phone itself that could provide clues about other people who might have been involved or help authorities pin down the precise motive or triggering event for the shooting.\\n\\nFor skeptics and privacy advocates, the focus on the phone feels a little misguided. The FBI has already been able to follow a fulsome digital trail on computers and social media that has helped investigators piece together what happened.\\n\\nWhat's more, although Farook and his wife were killed in a police shootout, the FBI has arrested a man who not only bought the weapons used in the attack, but also provided a long narrative about Farook and his radicalization.\\n\\nEven so, government officials want as much information as they can get.\\n\\nThere is a deep-seated law enforcement mentality of wanting everything in an investigation, irrespective of its relevance or whether the information duplicates data available somewhere else, said Fred Cate, vice president for Research at Indiana University and a senior fellow of its Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. You can easily understand where this comes from, but in an increasingly digital world, it is unworkable.\\n\\nFBI officials concede that Farook's phone may be an investigative dead end, but they feel pressure to follow every lead they can. The Justice Department said as much in a statement released Wednesday by Eileen Decker, the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.\\n\\nWe have made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible, she said. These victims and families deserve nothing less.\\n\\nTop national security and law enforcement officials have spent years warning about the dangers of encryption. FBI Director James Comey has said enhanced security on cellphones and other devices blunts the bureau's ability to find terrorists before they strike or to prosecute them if they are caught.\\n\\nCIA Director John Brennan has said terrorists use encrypted technology to make it exceptionally difficult, both technically, as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it.\\n\\nBoth men worry aloud that encryption of the kind on Apple's new phones will turn otherwise solvable cases into cold ones. They've also warned about encrypted communications apps and social networks, which they argue enable terrorists to operate outside the view of the agencies charged with stopping their attacks.\\n\\nThe Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University released a report earlier this month to look at whether cellphone encryption is as crucial to an investigation as authorities claim. The report, titled Don't Panic: Making Progress on the 'Going Dark' Debate was written by a diverse group that included former leaders at the National Counterterrorism Center like Matthew Olsen and denizens of the cyber world like Bruce Schneier.\\n\\nWhile the report's authors couldn't agree on the best balance between privacy and security, it conceded that they could see how conducting certain types of surveillance has, to some extent, become more difficult. But, at the same time it questioned whether the 'going dark' metaphor accurately describes the state of affairs. Are we really headed to a future in which our ability to effectively surveil criminals and bad actors is impossible? We think not.\\n\\nWorcester Polytechnic's Landau, who helped author the report, said it's easy to appreciate why the FBI is trying to corral as much information as it can in the San Bernardino case.\\n\\nI do understand that this and every investigation requires due diligence, she said. But at this point it is unlikely, even if the Farook phone is opened, that the FBI is going to get much new information from doing this.\\n\\nBut Stewart Baker, former general counsel at the National Security Agency and a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security, says that for today's investigations, cellphone data is still a cornerstone of process.\\n\\nI think that the argument that you can get a lot of information elsewhere to solve crimes so you don't have to worry about encrypted cellphones is disingenuous, Baker said.\\n\\nSure, sometimes that will be true, he said. There will be crimes that can be solved that way that might not be solved otherwise and that might be a good response on average. It might be enough on average. But if you look at something like San Bernardino, that's a crime about which we need to know as much as we can — and whatever might be hiding on that cellphone is part of that."}
{"original": "How Pinterest Jumped Into The Fight Against Health Misinformation\\n\\nSince 2017, the social media website Pinterest has limited search results for false cures and anti-vaccine advice. NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Pinterest's Ifeoma Ozoma about the policy.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nMore than 120 people have been diagnosed with measles so far this year in outbreaks in Texas, New York and Washington. One factor public health officials suspect is contributing to these outbreaks - anti-vaccine information on social media. Pinterest, the visual bookmarking site, has decided to intervene. A 2017 policy limits search results related to, quote, health misinformation, including about vaccines. Ifeoma Ozoma is the public policy and social impact manager for Pinterest. Before this policy was in place...\\n\\nIFEOMA OZOMA: For a term like vaccine, if you had searched vaccine, much of the content was in violation of our community guidelines because it was anti-vaccine advice.\\n\\nCORNISH: A search on the site for cancer cures might have brought up pins or bookmarks for pages about herbs and juices that work better than chemotherapy. Now you'll find a message that says pins about this topic often violate our community guidelines, so we're currently unable to show search results.\\n\\nOZOMA: Our goal, really, is harm reduction. And so because we're humble about our limitations and our own expertise here, we look to outside experts like the WHO, CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics and their guidance on what's harmful.\\n\\nCORNISH: Now, there are some critics of this move. Jennifer Granick of the ACLU told The Wall Street Journal that this is dangerous, that it's essentially a secretive process, no real appeal. People are making very difficult subject calls when it comes to politics and culture and religion. What's your response?\\n\\nOZOMA: So to that, we have clear and transparent community guidelines. And this is just one way of enforcing, like...\\n\\nCORNISH: Like buried in the terms and conditions or what do you mean by that?\\n\\nOZOMA: No. Nope. They're clear in our community guidelines on our website. And we also, whenever we have a search that we've removed results for, we explain right in there in the search advisory why we removed it, and we link to those community guidelines. And we also have an appeals process for any content that's taken down.\\n\\nCORNISH: Is this essentially censorship?\\n\\nOZOMA: For us, we don't see it as that. There's an enthusiasm gap between those who save harmful health misinformation and organizations like the CDC and WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics. And so because of that, you're going to find more health misinformation than, say, journal articles on the virtues of vaccination or other science-based health interventions. We've taken the view that further sharing that harmful content through our search results isn't in line with enforcing our community guidelines.\\n\\nCORNISH: Your title is public policy and social impact manager. None of those things are things we thought about when we thought about social media when it was first starting up, right? We called them platforms. They were just places we put things that we wanted to share. When do you think this mindset changed?\\n\\nOZOMA: We have had content policy and trust and safety teams since the beginning. And so safety has always been a consideration when you think about different types of harmful content, whether they're illegal or not illegal. Safety has been top of mind and still is for every team across the company.\\n\\nCORNISH: People go to the Internet and go to these platforms to find like-minded communities and to share information. Are you doing damage to that, that kind of agreement that they think they have with you?\\n\\nOZOMA: Yeah. So harmful misinformation is not inspiring, and it's not the kind of content that our platform hopes to promote. And because...\\n\\nCORNISH: But what if people think you shouldn't be the one to make that decision for them? As adults who are on the Internet doing research on their own, why should you get to make that call?\\n\\nOZOMA: Well, we aren't making the call because vaccines are settled science. And we also are very clear because we know that there may be questions about the decisions that we've made. We're really clear and transparent in our community guidelines and use simple language so that everyone can understand why we're considering certain content harmful.\\n\\nCORNISH: Ifeoma Ozoma is the Pinterest public policy social impact manager.

{"original": "Congressional Republicans Lobby Trump To Back Down On Tariffs\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 3:00 p.m. ET\\n\\nFears of economic and political backlash are motivating senior congressional Republicans to move forward this week with public and private lobbying efforts aimed at getting President Trump to change his mind about tariffs he intends to levy on steel and aluminium imports.\\n\\nWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.\\n\\nPresident Trump downplayed congressional GOP concerns. I don't think you're going to have a trade war, he said Monday at the White House, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. People have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. Everybody.\\n\\nThe president noted that his efforts to renegotiate NAFTA continue as well. We are renegotiating NAFTA as I said I would, and if we don't make a deal I will terminate NAFTA, he warned.\\n\\nCongress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.\\n\\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, David Reichert, R-Wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. They are seeking additional signatures from House Republicans. Aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader GOP can get behind.\\n\\nAs the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers, Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.\\n\\nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, Hatch said in a weekend statement.\\n\\nThe White House showed no indication Monday that the president was considering changing his mind. The president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen, said National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, a top Trump aide who, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.\\n\\nUnderstand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on K Street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the American worker and on behalf of the country, Navarro said. This is a very well-informed decision.\\n\\nTrump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating, said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Likewise, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called Trump's decision a welcome step.\\n\\nRepublicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.\\n\\nI don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade, Thune told reporters. Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would let China off the hook while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping, Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.\\n\\nCongress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade."}
{"original": "Week In Politics: The White House's Response To The Coronavirus Crisis\\n\\nWe discuss the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the points of tension between President Trump and some governors demanding more resources for their state.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nFirst COVID-19 fatality in the United States was announced on February 29, when 22 cases were confirmed in the country. Twenty-eight days later, we have over 1,700 deaths and over 100,000 cases confirmed, as the White House response to this ongoing crisis has been more political than pragmatic. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.\\n\\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\\n\\nSIMON: The president has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of being lax about planning for a pandemic, said he had to fix a broken health care system. During Thursday's briefing, he said he had to take over an empty shelf for medical supplies. People are dying. This is a serious charge. Do any facts support the president's charge?\\n\\nELVING: Scott, you're not hearing those charges from the health professionals around the president. They come when the president starts freelancing on Twitter or in a briefing. And if there was something missing when Trump came to power - that was, of course, over three years ago. What we do know is that there was an extensive plan, almost 70 pages, prepared by a special office within the National Security Council in the White House and turned over to the Trump administration. In 2018, almost two years ago, that office was essentially disbanded, and that plan was essentially discarded. So those are the facts. Those are the things that we do know.\\n\\nAnd we do know also that there were tests offered to the Trump administration by the World Health Organization. Those were refused. And in both cases, of course, the Trump people have been saying they had something better to put in its place.\\n\\nSIMON: And I have to ask, is there a difference between how responsive the president has been, or supportive, to governors from predominantly Republican states than Democratic states?\\n\\nELVING: There do seem to be two kinds of response - one for states with very few cases, often red states that are less densely populated, and another for states with heavily Democratic, dense metro areas. We should say the president does seem concerned about New York and New Jersey. And he wants to be seen as effective against the virus in general nationwide. But he has also gone to war with several of the big state Democratic governors who have been pointing to the lack of ventilators and other problems.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I say, Mike, don't call the governor of Washington. You're wasting your time with him. Don't call the woman in Michigan. It doesn't make any difference what happens...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The governor of Washington...\\n\\nTRUMP: No. You know what I say? If they don't treat you right, I don't call.\\n\\nELVING: So that is what I would describe as going to war with some of the blue-state governors. And he has also called the governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, a snake.\\n\\nSIMON: Of course, we know New York has been especially hard-hit. Governor Andrew Cuomo has been front and center day after day. Has he suddenly become the face and voice of national Democratic leaderships?\\n\\nELVING: Yes, to some degree. As governor of a big state and a state that's a media hub and, as you say, so hard-hit, Governor Cuomo is a natural point man to lead the call for greater supplies and to lead Democratic governors in their critique of the president. But he is not himself a candidate for president just now and won't be unless something happens to Joe Biden.\\n\\nSIMON: Bernie Sanders is still running for the Democratic nomination for president, says he wants to participate in the next debate. What effect does his - if he still runs, what effect does his candidacy even have now?\\n\\nELVING: His effect is on the conversation about issues and policy and the crisis, And we can see a lot of Sanders' thinking in the big relief bill Congress just passed - $2 trillion.\\n\\nBut as for the nomination, he is down and fading. Wisconsin votes in 10 days. They still plan to go ahead on April 7. That was one of Bernie Sanders' best states four years ago. So he needs to win Wisconsin to stay in the race this year. He was ahead in Wisconsin when there was a big field of candidates, but that big field now seems to have largely consolidated to Joe Biden. And at the last polling, I saw Bernie Sanders was losing to Biden badly.\\n\\nSIMON: NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

President Trump had earlier said the announcement could come at some point over the weekend.\\n\\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump pledged to immediately terminate DACA, the program that former President Barack Obama began five years ago to protect immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\\n\\nBut once in the White House, Trump took a softer stance.\\n\\nThe DACA situation is a very, very — it's a very difficult thing for me, he said during a February 2017 news conference. He added, You have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way. It's a very — It's a very, very tough subject. We're going to deal with DACA with heart.\\n\\nThree months later, Trump told the Associated Press, The DREAMers should rest easy. The term DREAMers is often used to refer to DACA participants.\\n\\nOn Friday, when asked if DREAMers should be worried, Trump replied, We love the DREAMers. We love everybody.\\n\\nBut the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is under threat with the administration facing a potential legal challenge over its future. Supporters fear the policy that has shielded hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation could soon be phased out.\\n\\nWe hear that the president is conflicted about it, and we hope that that is because there is a clear understanding that rescinding DACA is morally bankrupt because it would destroy the lives of youth who know no other country but this one as their own, said Clarissa Martínez de Castro, deputy vice president of the Latino advocacy group UnidosUS.\\n\\nPolitics Immigrant Advocates Prepare For Threats Against DACA Program Immigrant Advocates Prepare For Threats Against DACA Program Listen · 3:55 3:55\\n\\nDACA deadline looming\\n\\nNow a deadline is looming: Sept. 5. That is the date attorneys general from Texas and nine other Republican-led states are giving the Trump administration to answer an ultimatum: End the DACA program or face a legal challenge.\\n\\nBecause it's temporary, because it was based on an executive action taken by President Obama, it's very vulnerable to a change, said Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice.\\n\\nDACA critics argue the policy represents executive overreach and, as a result, is unconstitutional.\\n\\nSupporter: DACA 'helps advance the rule of law'\\n\\nThis is actually a program that helps advance the rule of law by having people come forward and be on the books and working just like everybody else, said de Castro.\\n\\nDACA allows some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children to get renewable, two-year deferrals from deportation and work legally, so long as they are enrolled in or graduated from high school or college and pass a background check, among other things.\\n\\nLuis Angel Aguilar, 29, applied for DACA protections in 2013.

Aguilar's father had previously immigrated illegally and was deported roughly four years later.\\n\\nAguilar says that without the DACA policy, he fears he would be an immediate target for deportation because he doesn't qualify for family-sponsored immigration or the program for high-skilled foreign workers.\\n\\nI think that's one misconception that often gets told — that I can just apply for citizenship, he said. There's no line, per se, for me to be able to get behind.\\n\\nAguilar now lives in Virginia and works for an immigrant rights group.\\n\\nConsidering the options\\n\\nTrump staffers have been weighing the options available to the president, but it's not clear what Trump will do.\\n\\nHe could revoke the DACA participants' work permits outright or gradually phase out the program by refusing new applicants and letting the current permits expire.\\n\\nHe could also choose to do nothing and refuse to defend the program in court.\\n\\nSome White House officials have encouraged the president pursue another path: Strike a deal with Congress to enshrine DACA in law in exchange for funding for his long-promised southern border wall.\\n\\nBut Democrats and immigration advocates say that option seems less viable.\\n\\nNobody wants to protect DREAMers at the expense of other groups of immigrants, said Sharry. Honestly, I think I think the real call is for President Trump to maintain DACA as is until Congress can act and enact a permanent solution.\\n\\nIn an interview with Wisconsin talk radio WCLO on Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., says that he opposes the Trump administration ending DACA and that it is up to Congress to find a legislative fix to the question of what to do with the children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. The speaker said that Obama was wrong to act without Congress and that Trump should defer to Congress to fix the issue.\\n\\nHaving said all of that there are people who are in limbo. These are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don't know another home, Ryan said. And so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that's one that we're working on, and I think we want to give people peace of mind.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday told reporters that the Trump administration is still reviewing DACA.\\n\\nIt has not been finalized, and when it is, we will certainly let you know, she said.\\n\\nIn the meantime, supporters of the DACA policy say they're bracing for what comes next.\\n\\nNPR's Susan Davis contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Justice Department Knew 2018 Border Policy Would Separate Children From Families\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\\n\\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions knew his zero tolerance policy on illegal entry along the Southwest border in 2018 would separate children from their parents, a watchdog office reported on Thursday. Despite warnings that the government couldn't care for the children, he pushed forward with the policy. As a result, more than 3,000 children were separated from their families.\\n\\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a critical review which found the department failed to effectively prepare for and manage the policy's implementation.\\n\\nTrump administration officials significantly underestimated [the policy's] complexities and demonstrated a deficient understanding of the legal requirements related to the care and custody of separated children.\\n\\nThe review concludes that the Justice Department's single-minded focus on increasing immigration prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact of family unit prosecutions and child separations.\\n\\nThe administration had told federal prosecutors in 2017 to prioritize immigration prosecutions. Throughout the year, the DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security discussed possible policy changes, including criminally prosecuting family unit adults and separating them from their children, the report said.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Western District of Texas U.S. Attorney's Office had begun prosecuting adults in certain instances, even if it resulted in separation from their children. It was referred to as the El Paso Initiative. Prosecutors and judges noted concerns about the whereabouts of the children of approximately 280 broken families.\\n\\nFollowing the perceived success of the El Paso Initiative, Sessions' policy went into effect on April 6, 2018.\\n\\nI have put in place a 'zero tolerance' policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border, Sessions said one month later in San Diego. If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It's that simple. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images\\n\\nDays after his speech in San Diego, U.S. attorneys along the border raised concerns about family separations as well as the whereabouts of children, the review notes. Sessions promised additional resources, but instructed them to stay the course.\\n\\nThe review says Sessions had grossly underestimated the legal and logistical challenges accompanying his policy. His department also failed to effectively coordinate with other agencies, including the U.S. Marshal's Service, who were given no advanced notice, the review said. The USMS told the DOJ there would be resource shortages, which would impact the safety of the public, courthouses, detention facilities and staff.\\n\\nFederal judges and other stakeholders along the border grew concerned as the courts became burdened with cases. On June 20, 2018, President Trump issued an executive order that curtailed the policy, replacing it with a similar one that kept families together. The damage had already been done.\\n\\nDenise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA, called on the incoming Biden administration to make families whole and provide pathways for them to obtain legal status.\\n\\nThis report reinforces what we already knew: the cruelty was the point and the government ripped families apart intentionally to keep families from seeking safety here, Bell said in a statement. This utter disregard for people's lives caused irreparable harm."}
{"original": "Why Some Patients Getting Drugmakers' Help Are Paying More\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\\n\\nSince Kristen Catton started taking the drug Gilenya two years ago, she's had only one minor relapse of her multiple sclerosis, following a bout of the flu.\\n\\nThanks to the medicine, she says, she's able to walk comfortably, see clearly and work part time as a nurse case manager at a hospital near her home in Columbus, Ohio. This is a big step forward; two drugs she previously tried failed to control her physical symptoms or prevent repeated flare-ups.\\n\\nThe drug is expensive — about $90,000 a year. Novartis, the company that makes Gilenya, helps defray that cost for Catton and other patients by making their copayments directly to the patient's health plan; Catton's copay for the medicine is roughly $3,800 a month.\\n\\nUntil recently those payments by the drug company helped Catton save money on her medical out-of-pocket expenses, because they counted toward her family's $8,800 annual pharmacy deductible on their health plan.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kristen Catton Courtesy of Kristen Catton\\n\\nBut his year, Catton got a shock. Her health plan changed the way it handles Novartis' payments, and the money no longer counts toward that deductible.\\n\\nCatton is one of a growing number of consumers taking expensive medicine who are discovering they are no longer insulated by copay assistance programs that used to help cover their costs.\\n\\nThrough such programs, consumers typically have owed nothing or have had modest monthly copays for pricey drugs, thanks to a financial contribution by the drugmaker that chips away at the consumer's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum limits until the health plan starts paying the whole tab.\\n\\nUnder the copay accumulator programs introduced by some health plans in 2018, the process has changed.\\n\\nIn Catton's case the change meant that after she hit the drug manufacturer's payment cap for the copay assistance in April, she's had to pay the entire co-payment herself — roughly $3,800 — and will have to continue to pay it until her health plan's pharmacy deductible is met.\\n\\nFor May, Catton has put the $3,800 copay on a credit card. But, she says, her family can't afford to pay nearly $9,000 a year out-of-pocket for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nI'm talking to my doctor to see if I can I take it every other day, she says. I guess I'm winging it until I can figure out what to do.\\n\\nDrug copay assistance programs have long been controversial. Proponents say that in an age of increasingly high deductibles and coinsurance charges, such help from the manufacturer is the only way some patients can afford crucial medications.\\n\\nBut opponents to such assistance say the programs increase drug spending on expensive brand-name drugs by discouraging patients from using more cost-effective alternatives.\\n\\nThat last argument misses an important point, according to Bari Talente, executive vice president for advocacy at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\\n\\nGenerally the multiple sclerosis drugs are not substitutable, she says. Most have different mechanisms of action, different administration and different side effect profiles. And generics, when they're available, are pricey too — typically costing $60,000 or more annually, she says.\\n\\nMost annual copay assistance limits for MS drugs, if available, are between $9,000 and $12,000, Talente says.\\n\\nSome employers argue that the drug copayment programs are an attempt to circumvent their efforts to manage health care costs. There's also the issue of fairness, they say.\\n\\nFrom an employer perspective, everyone under the plan has to be treated the same, says Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers.\\n\\nIf someone needs medical care such as surgery, for example, that person doesn't get help covering his deductible, he says.\\n\\nIn an NBGH survey of about 140 multistate employers with at least 5,000 workers, 17 percent report they have a copay accumulator program in place this year, Marcotte says. Fifty-six percent say they're considering them for 2019 or 2020.\\n\\nMarcotte says that if there is no other comparable drug available, drug copayment programs may have a role to play if they can be structured so that participating patients are paying some amount toward their deductible. But, he argues, assistance programs for drugs that are available from more than one source — such as a brand drug that is also available as a generic — shouldn't be allowed.\\n\\nIn 2016, 20 percent of prescriptions for brand-name drugs used a drug copay assistance coupon, according to an analysis by researchers at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. Among the top 200 drugs (based on spending) in 2014, the study found that 132 were brand-name drugs, and 90 of them offered copay coupons.\\n\\nFifty-one percent of the drugs with copay coupons had no substitute at all, or only another brand drug as a close therapeutic substitute, the analysis found.\\n\\nAdvocates for people with HIV and AIDS say copay accumulators are cropping up in their patients' plans and beginning to cause patients trouble. Drugs to treat HIV typically don't have generic alternatives.\\n\\nThe biggest impact for the community their organizations serve may be for PrEP — a daily pill that helps prevent HIV infection, says Carl Schmid, deputy executive director at the AIDS Institute, an advocacy group. A 30-day supply of PrEP (brand-name Truvada) can cost nearly $2,000. Gilead, the drug's manufacturer, offers a copay assistance program that covers up to $3,600 annually in copay assistance, with no limit on how much is paid per month.\\n\\nThey're at risk for HIV, they know it and want to protect themselves, Schmid says. It's a public health issue.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the AIDS Institute was among 60 HIV organizations that sent letters to state attorneys general and insurance commissioners across the country asking them to investigate this practice, which has emerged in employer and marketplace plans this year.\\n\\nCompounding advocates' concerns is the fact that these coverage changes are frequently not communicated clearly to patients, Schmid says. They are typically buried deep in the plan documents and don't appear in the user-friendly summary of benefits and coverage that consumers receive from their health plan.\\n\\nHow is a patient to know? Schmid asks. They learn of the change only when they get a big bill midway through the year. And then they're stuck.\\n\\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

{"original": "Despite Few Details And Much Doubt, The Green New Deal Generates Enthusiasm\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nFor a nonbinding resolution with an uncertain future, the Green New Deal is getting a lot of attention, along with a decidedly mixed reaction.\\n\\nDozens of Democrats on Thursday introduced the measure, an ambitious framework for future legislation designed to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030.\\n\\nOur energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun, said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., as he announced the legislation on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nThe resolution has few details, but it aims to overhaul the U.S. economy and spread wealth more evenly. It calls for a speedy shift in energy generation, from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar, and for a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.\\n\\nMuch of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan, which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem.\\n\\nAll great American programs, everything from The Great Society to The New Deal, started with a vision for our future, said co-sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\\n\\nBut this vision is for an extremely near-term future.\\n\\nI'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10-year time frame, former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz tells NPR's All Things Considered.\\n\\nMoniz, now CEO of Energy Futures Initiative, agrees that the U.S. needs to pick up the pace of its shift away from carbon, but he calls the decade-long time frame impractical. He worries it could turn off key constituencies needed in the climate effort, including labor unions, oil companies and the business community.\\n\\nI'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10-year time frame.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal doesn't even mention some of the usual ideas for addressing climate change, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. Instead, it calls for lots of spending to create, among other things, infrastructure and transport that don't rely on fossil fuels.\\n\\nEnvironmental groups generally support the resolution.\\n\\nIt is a breath of fresh air to see leaders in Congress discussing climate solutions that rise to the scale of the challenge, said Aliya Haq, federal policy director for the Climate & Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in a statement.\\n\\nBut some groups were disappointed the plan doesn't call for a complete end to using fossil fuels.\\n\\nWe have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth.\\n\\nThe oil industry says it's already reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector as coal plants switch to natural gas.\\n\\nThey need to do a whole lot more homework\\n\\nThese days, transportation accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Green New Deal backers say they want more high-speed trains to make airline travel less necessary, and more electric cars and charging stations. But experts warn that changing the existing fleet of cars in the U.S. would be an extraordinary effort.\\n\\nThere's 350 million liquid fuel cars on the road today in the United States and most Americans don't buy a new car except every decade, says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the program on Energy Security and Climate Change at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\nGreen New Deal backers say they also want to eventually phase out nuclear energy, which currently supplies 20 percent of electricity in the U.S. The Nuclear Energy Institute argues in a statement that its electricity is carbon-free and should be a part of any program addressing climate change.\\n\\nThe proposal takes aim at methane from cows, too. Methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas, and cows produce a lot of it. But the beef industry is at a loss to respond because of the lack of details in the Green New Deal.\\n\\nThey need to do a whole lot more homework and much more research and analysis before we can ever even really engage in this discussion, says Colin Woodall, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\\n\\nSo far the plan's biggest success may be that it's energizing thousands of young activists.\\n\\nA group called the Sunrise Movement held a Web meeting with supporters around the country Tuesday. Jeremy Ornstein, 18, says he deferred going to college to work with the organization.\\n\\nOrnstein is among the Sunrise Movement organizers who plan three weeks of activism, including lobbying members of Congress to sign onto the Green New Deal.\\n\\nAnd we're going to give our elected officials a deadline. They've got to get an answer to us by Feb. 26 or face the consequences, warns Ornstein. He says activists around the country will occupy members' offices in what the group calls a nationwide day of action.\\n\\nGiven the scope and ambitious nature of the Green New Deal, it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. But Amy Myers Jaffe hopes older, more experienced policymakers won't do that.\\n\\nWe need not to discourage them, she says. They have an energy and will to innovation that is not only infectious, but inspiring.\\n\\nAnd she says that could be what's needed to address a problem as daunting as climate change."}

Bush administration. Before that, he was a senior policy adviser at CMS working on the implementation of Medicare's then-new drug coverage for seniors.\\n\\nGottlieb is a prolific writer on health care issues, particularly the pharmaceutical industry. He is seen as a strong supporter of that industry and has championed deregulation.\\n\\nI think Scott is absolutely qualified, lawyer John Taylor of Greenleaf Health tells STAT. He has good professional credentials and personal integrity, and a track record that shows the ability to make difficult decisions.\\n\\nWhile Trump has promised at various times to make fairly radical changes at the FDA, Gottlieb is a seen as a conventional choice for commissioner by a Republican president.\\n\\nEarlier in the year, odds were favoring the nomination of Jim O'Neill, an associate of Silicon Valley entrepreneur and billionaire Peter Thiel, a close Trump adviser. O'Neill created waves when he called for drugs to be approved as soon as they had been judged to be safe but before they are proved to be effective, as required under current law.\\n\\nShould Gottlieb be approved by the Senate, one early target he may aim for is so-called off-label promotion of prescription drugs. The Obama administration issued tighter restrictions on how companies could market drugs for conditions not mentioned on drug labels — signifying the lack of FDA approval for that cause. Gottlieb has been highly critical of the Obama rules.\\n\\nGottlieb has many possible financial conflicts that could feature prominently in his confirmation hearings. He serves on advisory boards for several major pharmaceutical companies.\\n\\nGottlieb is entangled in an unprecedented web of Big Pharma ties, says Dr. Michael Carome, the director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a pro-consumer advocacy group. He has spent most of his career dedicated to promoting the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry, and the U.S. Senate must reject him.\\n\\nAccording to the ProPublica website Dollars for Docs, Gottlieb received more than $400,000 between August 2013 and December 2015 in promotional talks, research, consulting and travel while practicing at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut.\\n\\nAs FDA commissioner, Gottlieb would oversee an agency that has regulatory power over a quarter of the U.S. economy, including not just pharmaceuticals but medical devices, food safety, cosmetics and other areas of human and animal health."}
{"original": "Many Veterans Gained Health Care Through The Affordable Care Act\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption ERproductions Ltd/Blend Images RM/Getty Images ERproductions Ltd/Blend Images RM/Getty Images\\n\\nAlmost half a million veterans gained health care coverage during the first two years of the Affordable Care Act, a report finds.\\n\\nIn the years leading up to the implementation of the ACA's major coverage provisions, from 2010 to 2013, nearly 1 million of the nation's approximately 22 million veterans didn't have health insurance. Almost half of all veterans are enrolled in the VA health system; others get health care through employers or Medicare. But some don't quality for those options, and others don't know that they have them.\\n\\nTwo years after the ACA's implementation, 429,000 veterans under the age of 65 gained coverage, which is a 40 percent drop in vets without insurance from 2013 to 2015. The vets were covered for the most part through Medicaid expansion, privately purchased plans and marketplace coverage, according to the report.\\n\\nThe number of insured veterans rose across demographics like age, gender, race and education level. The gains in coverage were really broad, says Jennifer Haley, a research associate at the Urban Institute, a research group based in Washington, D.C., who was an author on the report.\\n\\nVeterans with the lowest incomes saw the greatest increase in coverage, especially in states that adopted Medicaid expansion. Vets with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $16,394 a year for an individual, became eligible for Medicaid in expansion states, the report notes.\\n\\nIn 2015, just 4.8 percent of veterans were uninsured in states that participated in Medicaid expansion, compared to 7.1 percent in states that did not.\\n\\nOne in 5 uninsured vets live in states that did not expand Medicaid and would have been eligible for coverage had their state chosen to expand the program, the report found. Haley says these are key data points when considering changes to policy.\\n\\nIf states would adopt the expansion, more vets would qualify for publicly supported coverage, she says. Currently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid programs, including California, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois. Another 19 states, including Florida and Texas, have not expanded access to the program.\\n\\nVeterans weren't the only ones to benefit from expanded insurance access. Their family members had access to more coverage, too, and by a similar margin.\\n\\nThe overall rate of uninsurance among relatives sank from 9.2 percent in 2013 to 4.5 percent in 2015. For children, the rates fell from 4.5 to 2.9 percent. Overall, 730,000 fewer vets and their family members were lacking health insurance from 2013 to 2015.\\n\\nThe report, published by the Urban Institute, used data from the American Community Survey, which is performed annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. It surveys around 100,000 veterans and 100,000 family members of veterans. The report also considered data from the National Health Interview Survey which is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.\\n\\nA repeal of the ACA or a rollback of Medicaid could negate these coverage increases and leave more vets without health insurance coverage, the authors note in their report. The VA health system continues to struggle with delays in delivery of services to veterans.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a law extending the Veterans Choice program, which allows some vets get health care from private providers paid for by the VA and was created to help improve access to timely care.\\n\\nThe $10 billion program has been riddled with problems, as Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports, including long waits, a confusing, complicated system and delayed payments to providers."}

She says there are 50 kids at this complex, all between the ages of 15 and 18. They come from countries across Africa and the Middle East — mostly boys, and a handful of girls.\\n\\nThey can stay in this protected environment until they are 21, Pfeifer says. Staff members are on hand to help 24 hours a day. Many of the kids have endured traumatic trips. They can talk about it with a psychologist if they want, but she says the staff doesn't question the youngsters about what they went through.\\n\\nWe are working with them from now and the future, says Pfeifer. That's the important thing: What do you want in the future?\\n\\nNo one knows exactly how many unaccompanied minors are on the move across Europe, but Germany registered 60,000 and Sweden 35,000 last year alone. Sweden has created hundreds of homes for unaccompanied minors across the country.\\n\\nSweden has been accepting about 400 unaccompanied minors a year since 2004, says Sophia Ohvall Lindberg of the Swedish Migration Agency. But, she adds, I must say we weren't ready for 35,000.\\n\\nIn Ronneby, Pfeifer says these kids have risked a lot and show great determination.\\n\\nThey have a mission. They have to do something, they have to show something, she says. So they don't come here to be asleep the whole day. They want to start school immediately. They want to work. They want to do something.

There's really nothing I don't like about Sweden. I even love the weather!\\n\\nAt Stockholm University, researcher Aycan Celikaksoy is following the progress of unaccompanied young asylum seekers who've been coming to Sweden for more than a decade.\\n\\nSometimes the whole traveling process without their families takes several years, she says. The kids have to work in transit countries to be able to pay smugglers. So it's not only [their] arrival age that's important — but of course, at what age these children have been left alone and how long they've been fleeing their countries.\\n\\nOhvall Lindberg says the huge number of arrivals has put pressure on the system, but Sweden still strives to do what's best for the children. They attend special language classes to prepare them for education in Sweden. Every unaccompanied minor is assigned a legal guardian who manages the child's monthly stipend from the government and makes sure he or she is in school and receiving proper care. Ohvall Lindberg says there has been a shortage of people to serve as legal guardians.\\n\\nThis year, Sweden passed a law saying that every municipality must accommodate its share of migrants. This country of 10 million took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 alone, most from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That would be the equivalent of the U.S. opening its doors to 5 million asylum seekers.\\n\\nReconsidering The Open-Door Policy\\n\\nBut many Swedes appear to be rethinking the country's decades-long open-door policy for refugees. Some polls late last year showed Sweden's anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, with growing support.\\n\\nMigrants under age 18 get special consideration when they apply for asylum in Sweden. But Kent Ekeroth, a Sweden Democratic member of parliament, believes many who claim to be minors are actually much older. He is calling for medical tests to confirm the actual ages.\\n\\nDenmark and Norway already carry out tests to measure bone density and estimate age. But the Swedish medical community has called them unreliable and unethical. Meanwhile, Ekeroth complains that Sweden now spends more to support migrants than it does to help Swedes.\\n\\nOur own population, our own elderly people who've been working 40, 50 years, who grew up here, they have to pay a lot more, says Ekeroth. So now we're discriminating against Swedes for the benefit of immigrants who have no respect for our country.\\n\\nSwedish officials say the country has successfully integrated previous waves of immigrants. A recent Stockholm University study shows unaccompanied minors who arrived in past years have generally been successful in finding jobs in the Swedish economy.\\n\\nThe Swedish migration agency's Ohvall Lindberg believes today's unaccompanied youths could be an asset for Sweden.\\n\\nWe need to understand that the children are going to be with us in the system for three, four years, and if we work very well with them during that time, then they are a resource for our country, she says. Because Sweden is going to need more people."}
{"original": "Air Travelers To U.S. Must Test Negative For COVID-19 Before Boarding\\n\\nAny air passengers flying to the U.S. will have to test negative for COVID-19. The CDC policy takes effect later this month and require passengers to get tested within 3 days of their flight.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nImportant news for people intending to fly to the U.S. - the CDC has announced that all travelers flying in from other countries will have to test negative for the coronavirus before they arrive. The policy goes into effect on January 26. NPR's Pien Huang reports.\\n\\nPIEN HUANG, BYLINE: It can be a spit test, a swab test, a 15-minute rapid antigen test. The key thing is that it's a documented negative test result for the coronavirus before you get on the plane.\\n\\nDr. Martin Cetron is CDC's director of Global Migration and Quarantine.\\n\\nMARTIN CETRON: So there is an obligation on the passengers to have a test within three days - a negative test result that they can show to the airline when they check in - to fill out an attestation that they had this test and for the airlines to only issue a boarding pass for folks coming into the United States that have had a documented negative test.\\n\\nHUANG: Passengers can also show proof that they've recently had the virus and recovered. Airlines are responsible for checking documentation and must refuse to board any passengers without it. The CDC says the new policy is in response to new variants that appear to be more contagious emerging around the world.\\n\\nDr. Claudia Hoyen is an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals in Cleveland.\\n\\nCLAUDIA HOYEN: They're really trying to protect us if there should be other variants that may pop up in other areas of the world that could potentially be not only more contagious, but cause more severe disease.\\n\\nHUANG: That hasn't happened yet as far as public health experts know, but it's something they're watching for. Other countries are even more restrictive, says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine. In Hong Kong, for instance, all arriving passengers are bussed to a convention center.\\n\\nLIN CHEN: And then they get tested there, and then they wait a few hours until the results are known. If they're positive, they go into isolation. If they're negative, they're allowed to go through their quarantine.\\n\\nHUANG: By contrast, the CDC is only suggesting that people self-quarantine for seven days and get retested a few days after arrival. The U.S. policy won't catch every infection, but Cetron from the CDC says it could make a difference in managing the caseload.\\n\\nCETRON: Right now, we're in a critical race between infection and vaccination. And the bridge to succeeding in the time it takes to get herd immunity and a successful vaccination going is to double down on all of our tools in our toolkit to suppress viral transmission.\\n\\nHUANG: He says it's no replacement for other public health measures, but it's one more thing that could help.\\n\\nPien Huang, NPR News.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE END OF THE OCEAN'S FORSAKEN)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Our Favorite Global TikToks Of 2020: From A Handwashing Dance To A Literal Ice Box\\n\\nWhen lockdown went into effect earlier this year, many people turned to TikTok to pass the time.\\n\\nLike, a lot of people: the short-video platform has now hit over 2.6 billion downloads globally and was the most downloaded app of 2020, according to mobile app analytics firm App Annie.\\n\\nThe pandemic is part of the reason for surging TikTok popularity.\\n\\nIt's been a bleak year for many people. Much of the content you see on TikTok is fun, upbeat and a welcome break from the day-to-day realities of the COVID crisis, says Damian Radcliffe, a professor at the University of Oregon who researches digital trends.\\n\\nSo what's distracting people from what Radcliffe calls the doom and gloom of 2020?\\n\\nActually, you'd be surprised at the viral TikToks of the year. How to ... get dirt out from under your fingernails, for one. Here are some of our favorite TikTok moments of 2020 from the year's most popular videos.\\n\\nGhen Cô Vy (Vietnam)\\n\\nIn February, a pop song-turned-PSA in Vietnam quickly became a TikTok sensation. The 2017 hit breakup song Ghen by Min and Erik received a lyrical makeover from the Ministry of Health to send a message about COVID-19 safety precautions. Newly titled Ghen Cô Vy, the song inspired a dance from choreographer Quang Đăng about how to thoroughly wash your hands — around the thumbs, under your fingernails, between the fingers. People then started filming themselves doing the dance on TikTok for the #ghencovychallenge, which has surpassed 41 million hashtag views.\\n\\nMuseo de Filipino (The Philippines)\\n\\nWe can fight corruption. I have shown it! — that's how one of the most popular #MuseodeFilipino videos kicks off. It's about the legacy of Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, who is known for holding public officials accountable. In this trend, users dress up as significant human rights defenders and activists in the Philippines and turn an on switch to share notable information about that person's life. The point-of-view style videos have become popular with young users who wish to educate their generation about trailblazers in their country.\\n\\nJerusalema Challenge (South Africa)\\n\\nIn late 2019, South African producer Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode released Jerusalema, an upbeat Zulu song about seeking salvation in the city of Jerusalem. As the pandemic wore on in the spring and people tried to manage the fear and anxiety surrounding the virus, a video of a group of friends in Angola joyfully dancing to the song inspired millions of people across Africa and the rest of the world to do the same.\\n\\nOn South Africa's Heritage Day holiday in September, President Cyril Ramaphosa praised the #JerusalemaChallenge for helping raise people's spirits during a time of crisis and encouraged everyone to try it out. Over 382 million people have viewed the hashtag on TikTok.\\n\\nMadiba Jive Challenge (South Africa)\\n\\nAnd there's another popular dance trend from South Africa, this time to commemorate the late Nelson Mandela. The #MadibaJiveChallenge, started in South Africa, features users from around the world emulating Mandela's dance moves — which he was famously photographed doing throughout his life — on what would've been his 102nd birthday on July 18. The modern take on Mandela's Madiba Dance, named after his clan name Madiba, has racked up over 8.7 million hashtag views on TikTok.\\n\\nMat kar forward (India)\\n\\nWith TikTok's growing popularity, digital researcher Damian Radcliffe says one of the biggest issues the app is facing globally is the spread of misinformation on its platform. We've already seen the app – like many other platforms – rife with conspiracy theories, misinformation around elections and misinformation related to the COVID vaccine and the wider health crisis, he explains.\\n\\nIn India, TikTok launched a campaign called #MatKarForward to tackle the issue of misinformation. The hashtag, which has received over 3.7 billion views, encourages users to stop and think before forwarding videos that promote fake news, such as COVID-19 homemade remedies and various conspiracies. The initial PSA stars cricket player Virat Kohli as well as famous actors Sara Ali Khan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon.\\n\\nA Stand Against Gender-Based Discrimination (Egypt)\\n\\nIn May, Egyptian teenager Aya Khamees made a now-deleted TikTok demanding justice after she says she was sexually assaulted at a party. The viral video resulted in her arrest for prostitution, drug use and violating family values. The latter charge is part of a larger crackdown of the Egyptian government against female influencers on TikTok for posting videos wearing clothes or participating in dances that are deemed inappropriate by a cybercrime law that targets any online violation of public morals.\\n\\nAlthough the state eventually dropped the charges against Aya Khamees, other TikTokers – like Haneen Hossam, whose video is embedded above — have faced arrests, hefty fines and even jail sentences for their content. The Tahrir Institute for Middle Eastern Policy reports that a group of women have since launched an online petition and campaign with the hashtag with permission from the Egyptian family, to advocate for the release of the TikTok users and call out what they say is the government's criminalization of women's free expression online.\\n\\nFrozen Life in Tibet\\n\\nIn the icy Himalayas, user kebi057 on TikTok shows people around the world about everyday life in Tibet. Pay attention to me to understand what my life is like, his bio reads. And people are definitely taking a look. He has over 236,000 followers and nearly 4 million likes for his videos — clips of himself pulling his sled with his dog, preparing food and, in his most popular video, building a natural refrigerator out of ice blocks over several days — to the amazement of people in the comments, who marveled at his literal ice box."}
{"original": "Lego Says It Is Changing Its Policy After Ai Weiwei Controversy\\n\\nA photo of Ai Weiwei covered in Lego bricks was posted to his Instagram account. 😄 A photo posted by Ai Weiwei (@aiww) on Jan 12, 2016 at 10:42pm PST\\n\\nLego says it is changing its guidelines for the purchase of large amounts of its iconic toy bricks, a policy that had generated a social media firestorm when used to block sales to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.\\n\\nThe company said in a statement that it will no longer ask people who want to buy the bricks in bulk what they're using them for:\\n\\nInstead, the customers will be asked to make it clear — if they intend to display their LEGO creations in public — that the LEGO Group does not support or endorse the specific projects.\\n\\nIn October, Ai said Lego had refused to sell him the bricks he needed for an exhibition on free speech at Australia's National Gallery of Victoria. He intended to use the bricks to create portraits of freedom advocates.\\n\\nA frequent critic of China who was imprisoned by the government, Ai accused the Danish company of censorship and said it was afraid to offend Beijing.\\n\\nAfter the company's decision, supporters of Ai set up donation points around the world for people to donate used bricks. Ai also told NPR that he was flooded with messages of support on social media:\\n\\nThey're not necessarily museumgoers, but they understand what is the most important meaning of art, which is to really express yourself successfully and to really defend the essential values.\\n\\nAi said pressure from his supporters had pressured Lego to change its policy on bulk orders, and he told The Associated Press that it was a good move:"}
{"original": "'Chappelle's Show' Co-Creator Moves Into The Limelight With '3 Mics'\\n\\nAfter working mostly as a behind-the-scenes guy on Chappelle's Show and Inside Amy Schumer, Neal Brennan is now stepping out as a performer. Originally broadcast Feb. 22, 2017.\\n\\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\\n\\nThis This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Today's guest, comic Neal Brennan, is mostly known for being a behind-the-scenes guy. With Dave Chappelle, he co-created and co-wrote the sketch comedy series Chappelle's Show, and he co-wrote a sketch for Saturday Night Live when Chappelle hosted just after Donald Trump was elected president. Brennan also has directed episodes of Inside Amy Schumer and wrote some material for Seth Meyers for his 2011 performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Brennan wrote for The Daily Show on Comedy Central, but Brennan has begun stepping out more as a performer. In February, when Terry spoke with him, he had recently released a comedy special on Netflix, which is still available for streaming. It's called 3 Mics, and he literally works with three different microphones. One mic is for his one-liners. One is for stand-up. And one is for his personal stories about things like depression and his family. Let's hear a clip from the stand-up section.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, 3 MICS)\\n\\nNEAL BRENNAN: I hang out with a lot of black dudes. Yeah, white people are always like - what's it like? It's, like, we don't do anything crazy. We just, like, eat and talk. Like, I don't have to rap.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Let's play a game called Sounds Racist, Isn't Racist - ready?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Such a horrible setup for a white person again. No, here it is. There have been a lot of good slave movies lately, right?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Sounds racist - I just enjoy them as movies. You guys think I'm, like, thinking it's a documentary. I get it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Here's what I've learned hanging out with black dudes. When a new slave movie comes out, it can't be your idea as the white person to go see it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Can't be like, have I got a movie for us? Follow me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Hi. Could I get 14 for Django, please? Thank you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: Slavery is such a big deal. It's such a big deal. If I were black, I would talk about it constantly. I really would. And a lot of white people go - well, I think black people talk about slavery too much as it is. First of all, if Italians went through slavery, they'd never shut the [expletive] up about, and you know that.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBRENNAN: You know it. And they'd all have some heroic story of escape, too, like - so finally My Uncle Fabrizio was like [expletive]. He punched the slave master, and he walked from North Carolina straight to Jersey. All right.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: I would talk about it constantly, constantly. Like, if I were black and waiting tables, I'd be like - all right, guys. Here's your check, and don't forget - slavery.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: If a cop stops me and he's like, you know why I pulled you over? I'd be like, to apologize for slavery?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nNeal Brennan, welcome to FRESH AIR.\\n\\nSo one of your mics on the 3 Mics is for, like, autobiographical stories - some of them are, you know, pretty sad - about your life and your family.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Thank you.\\n\\nGROSS: Yes, you're welcome.\\n\\nBRENNAN: (Laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: So was that a way of saying to people, look, there's three mics. There's one for stand-up. There's one for, like, one-liners and then there's one for, like, more serious stuff. Don't expect the big laughs in the more serious - like, don't start heckling me because I'm telling you (laughter) - because I'm telling you, like, more personal stories. Like, I'm on that mic. I'm on the mic set aside for that. We'll get back to the one-liners.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. It's expressly for serious stuff. And I found a lot of people start liking it more than the stand-up, which is kind of insulting. But - no, but they like it - like, they start to kind of - you build up a - sort of a - you metabolize it in a certain way, and then you're like I can't wait to get to the sad stuff.\\n\\nGROSS: So in your show, you're the guy onstage. You're the guy behind the mic - or the mics (laughter). But really, you had become best known for being a behind-the-scenes guy - directing Amy Schumer's show, writing for Chappelle's Show.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: I want to ask you about writing with him for the show. You co-created the show as well...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: ...As co-writing it. And so many of the sketches are about - were about race. And so you were, like, the white person writing from a black point of view. Were there times it was uncomfortable to be a white person writing sketches from a black point of view in the sense that there's always comedy you're allowed to do, for instance, about Jews - but only if you're Jewish - or about...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Gay people - but only if you're gay or about black people - but only if you're black? I could go on.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: No, please do. What else? No - yeah, I mean, there was never - it wasn't too awkward because it was just me and him. It was more just, like, pitching jokes. Like, hey, how about this? How about this? You want to do this? You want to do that? It was never - I would never take big swings in terms of racial jokes. Like, you know - well, hey, you know, black people do this. It was never that sort of bald.\\n\\nIt was more like a premise, and then we would sort of know. And a lot of what we did was make fun of white people's perception of black people. So I think, in some ways, I was a benefit that I could sort of not even - not explain, like, you know, white people see this. But there were certain things that I could maybe express - not like Dave wouldn't know but I could maybe verify. So it was never too awkward between...\\n\\nGROSS: Can you think of an example of that?\\n\\nBRENNAN: I'm thinking - the ones I'm thinking of are so broad, and they're not even good jokes. Like - and I - again, I don't like to - we had a deal where we wouldn't say who wrote what, but there are some jokes that are just like, who cares? We did a racial draft sketch when Tiger Woods gets drafted.\\n\\nGROSS: You have to explain the premise.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Oh, right. OK. So we did a racial draft where different racial groups draft people that are sort of in between. So Tiger Woods is half Asian and half black, so basically, he gets adopted by black people. He gets drafted by black people, and now he's officially black. And we did a bunch of them, like the Wu-Tang Clan got drafted by Asians, a bunch of things like that. I think Colin Powell got drafted by white people...\\n\\nGROSS: Yes.\\n\\nBRENNAN: ...I think. Yeah, so...\\n\\nGROSS: But only if they took Condoleezza Rice, too.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: That's correct. So anyway - so I was like - we were just - Chappelle - Dave was like, hey, I need - what should I say as Tiger Woods? And I was like, I don't know - goodbye, fried rice; hello, fried chicken? It's like - and it's a decent joke. But it's not anything I'm especially proud of. But it got the job done. It was like a Band-Aid line.\\n\\nGROSS: So you were actually on Chappelle's Show in a position that a lot of black people are in, which is being the minority person (laughter), I guess...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: You were the white person working with Chappelle and with a, you know, largely black cast and hanging out with a lot of fellow comics who were largely African-American. And I should mention here, your podcast Champs only has on comics of color (laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes, for the most part, yeah. And a few - we - and we had like - yeah, but yeah, we had - it wasn't all black people. But it was no - we had a no-white-people policy.\\n\\nGROSS: So I've asked a lot of African-Americans over the years what it's like to be, like, the black person who's, like, integrating the school or, you know, the only black person in their class or the only black person on the job or the only black writer on the show. So let me ask you the reverse question - what was it like being, like, the white guy?\\n\\nBRENNAN: It was very hard. No, it was great.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: It was - there is such a thing as being a minority but not being oppressed. I was a minority with power, I guess. I was a minority, but I was still the No. 2 guy. So I never felt like - I never felt oppressed. I think my whole goal was just to do right by Dave because I was thankful for the opportunity and to do right by black people at large, I think, vis-a-vis Dave.\\n\\nGROSS: So you also got to be the man directing Amy Schumer's show because you directed - what? - like, 10 episodes?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, the first season.\\n\\nGROSS: And there's so much real, like, girl and feminist stuff on that show. Did you feel like you learned things about women by doing that show?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Well, yeah. The thing that I would say about Schumer's show is that it - the way that the Chappelle's Show was about the horror of being a black man, Schumer's show was about the horror of being a woman, just the day-to-day inconvenience, you know. It's like, what's it like to have a world-class intellect in a world where you're treated like a third-class citizen? And that applies to Amy and Dave.\\n\\nIt's like, Dave's smarter than everyone he talks to and yet has to - and is routinely spoken down to by merit of being black, maybe less so now that he's famous. But as it was, you know, before he was famous, it was always this ongoing condescension, which I think women have to deal with on an hourly basis as well - and Amy being a great example of that. And maybe she - because she's famous now, there's less talking down to, but there's still a ton of it in both their cases.\\n\\nGROSS: All right. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Neal Brennan. He's a comic, writer and director. He has a Netflix comedy special that's called 3 Mics - that's as in microphone. And he was the co-creator of Chappelle's Show. He directed a bunch of episodes of Amy Schumer's show. He's written for Saturday Night Live. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is comic, writer and director Neal Brennan. And he has a Netflix comedy special called 3 Mics - mics as in microphones. One mic is for one-liners. One mic is for stand-up. And one mic is for his autobiographical monologues, which include stories about depression and his family. He also co-created Chappelle's Show and directed episodes of Inside Amy Schumer.\\n\\nLet's get back to 3 Mics. You talk about depression in your show. At what age did you become aware that other people weren't feeling what you were feeling, that you were sadder than other people, you had a problem most people did not?\\n\\nBRENNAN: That's a good question. You know, when I was a kid, I used to cry every day, like, when I was like, you know, 7 through 11 or 6 through 11, to the point where my brother and sisters would like - there was an ongoing joke where they would make me cry to keep my streak alive of crying every day.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: You know, pretty great. And so I think that's probably an indicator. It never occurred to me, like, you know, this is clinical depression. And I don't even know if it was. I maybe just was a sensitive little kid. But I think probably once I was, like, an adult, then you sort of realize like - oh, this isn't just like an attitude. This is actual - there may be something clinically happening here. And I think I started taking medication when I was 24.\\n\\nGROSS: You describe depression as being like a virus that attacks your brain with negative thoughts. And you also say, like, to say I had low self-esteem isn't true. I had no self-esteem. So it must be hard to decide to get onstage when you feel like you have no self-esteem.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. It's - it is hard. But it's also like a Hail Mary. It's a bit of a, like, well, screw it. Let me see if this works. Let me see if, like, you know, gale force approval works. And a lot of times it does, you know. I mean, that's the truth. It doesn't last long. It doesn't - it is a bit of a sieve, where the - it's hard to bank good feelings or approval. But it certainly is a short-term fix, getting approval from an audience.\\n\\nGROSS: Does it feel better when you're onstage delivering it yourself than when you've written it for somebody else and they're getting a laugh?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. It's definitely more direct. You know, I liken it to - when you write a joke for somebody else, it's like you - you know, like the Wile E. Coyote dynamite plunger, where he pushes the plunger down and then you see the fuse go then there's an explosion in the distance? That's like writing a joke for somebody. When you tell the joke, you're in the explosion. And you get all that approval for yourself, Terry.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) You know a lot of comics. And a lot of comics have depression. So do you have a theory of why that's so?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Comedy is almost like the valve, you know. So you can - you're, like, desperately trying to feel better. And I think you'll, like, think in different ways. You'll think in unique ways, and that will beget comedy because it's this desperation to feel a little bit better. There's also the theory, which Chris Rock has mentioned when he was talking about Robin Williams. He said, you know, if ignorance is bliss, you know, then consciousness can be miserable. You know, like, real paying attention and real observation and deep thought and deep consideration can be a bit, you know, miserable-making.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, that's the thing about really good comics is, like, you guys see beneath the surface of things and have the verbal facility and irony and comedy to kind of turn that into something that everybody gets and can - or at least a lot of people get...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: ...And can identify with. And plus, you can make it funny, so there's a moment of relief for everybody listening.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. It's like I've gone to the netherworld, and I brought back this, you know.\\n\\nGROSS: Right.\\n\\nBRENNAN: I brought back this nugget of thought or comedy or whatever.\\n\\nGROSS: So you're the youngest of 10 siblings, and you talk about this in your show 3 Mics. Your father was abusive. He was violent. He was an alcoholic. What kind of drunk was he?\\n\\nBRENNAN: He wasn't like a 10-drink guy. He was a three-drink guy every day. And it would sort of give him the - he - and then he would feel deputized to kind of rage or be vitriolic. I think it gave him the confidence to sort of let out his true self, which was kind of nasty and competitive and petty. I think that's more - it was never like fall-down, stumbling, slurring drunk. It was just more like a bullying drunk.\\n\\nGROSS: Did watching your father be a mean drunk affect how you felt about starting to drink, you know, when you became of age?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. I drank a lot in high school.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. No, I drank a lot in high school, mostly just to, like - I guess just to, like, fit in. But I've maybe gotten drunk three times in my adult life, twice maybe. Like, I can count - I just don't - it just doesn't do anything for me. Like I, A, like my personality. And B, I need energy. I don't need a depressant. So, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: So if your father became very insulting when he got drunk - and he got drunk a lot - did he insult you a lot? And did he insult you colorfully? Like, were they interesting insults or just mean ones?\\n\\nBRENNAN: My father was sort of - a lot of what he - I think a lot of his - the things he said were sort of stolen from, like, Frank Sinatra records.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) Are you kidding?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Like, just sort of - I remember hearing a, like, a live, like, Frank Sinatra Live From The Mirage or some Vegas show. And I'm like, oh, this sound - this was like where my dad - this is like where my dad's sort of style came from. You see it actually with Donald Trump, too. Like, where he - you can see, like, he believes in that, like, sort of Rat Pack-y (ph) - he - Donald Trump, like, you look at his press conference. He's just emceeing. Like - he's kind of doing, like, a Rat Pack thing, where he's kind of insulting people and a bit like Don Rickles-y (ph). So I think generationally, like, my father - were he alive, he'd be 80 - my dad would be 87 now, so he's older than Donald Trump. But, yeah. Like, that was the - that was sort of their paradigm of cool and funny was that kind of like Rat Pack-y thing.\\n\\nHe would get in on that crying thing. I remember him saying I'd be on the Olympic crying team, which is not a great joke. But he - I think he thought it was funny. So it was just, like, you know, kind of a cool little snap. But, you know, I was the - because I was the youngest, I was kind of, like, the mascot of the family. I was precocious. I was kind of cute. I had a bob haircut. And so I think my father - there was, like, a grudging respect he had for me because my brothers and sisters were all nice to me. And I think I was sort of considered wise and intelligent from a fairly young age. So I think I was a bit of like the opposition leader. Like, he knew I was against him. He knew I didn't approve of him. But I think he had to kind of respect me because he knew I was fairly intelligent.\\n\\nGROSS: In your autobiographical monologues in your show 3 Mics, you describe your father as a narcissist. Was that your diagnosis?\\n\\nBRENNAN: No, that was a doctor's diagnosis. In true, narcissistic fashion, when my father was diagnosed as a narcissist, he called us all up individually to tell us, and he did it with true pride. Like, he was like, - I have some - are you sitting down? I have some news. I'm a narcissist.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: So it was like - it was incredibly ironic. But yeah, he was a proud narcissist. I think he liked it. I think it made him feel, like, confident in himself. Like, I think he was like - it was somehow affirming to him that, like, I knew it. I knew I thought I was great...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: ...If that makes sense.\\n\\nGROSS: So what does it mean in the official lexicon of psychiatry that you're a narcissist - when you're a narcissist?\\n\\nBRENNAN: I think he - you know, my understanding is no empathy and every single thing is about how it affects you. And every single situation is about you.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. So your father was the father of 10 children, you being the youngest.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes, 10 people who were not him. Yes, go ahead.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Yeah, that must be a challenge. Like, you're supposed to have empathy with your children. You're supposed to really care about them, even put them before you many times.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: So it sounds like your father would not be...\\n\\nBRENNAN: That's what I've heard, yes.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) Sounds like your father was not doing that when he was raising you.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. He was not - he was not an empathetic guy. And he was not - he didn't want to have kids. I think ultimately, like, he just didn't want to have kids. I think that that's another thing that you weren't even allowed to really admit or acknowledge or live a life based on. Like, you couldn't say, I don't want kids, I don't think. Like, I think most of their - my mother and father's - life was just like, what's everybody else doing? I guess that's what we have to do. I think my mother was happy to do it. I think my mom loved having 10 kids. But I think my dad hated it. Really - I really think he just didn't like it. And he was kind of stuck, you know, which, you know, is - he - that's how he behaved.\\n\\nGROSS: How did that leave you feeling about having children yourself?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Well, Terry, I don't have any.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: So I think it's pretty clear how it left me feeling. My brother Kevin used to do a joke where he said like, yeah, I'm from a big family. I know how that ends. Like, he didn't want to have kids. He now has two kids. But yeah, like, it doesn't - it's not - I don't know. I'm not curious. It wasn't - yeah, I don't know. I think it's - the same way alcohol affected me, I think I'm having a similar - I had a similar response to children, even though I was the youngest, so I can't say like, oh, it was awful. And it was fun in a lot of ways. But I never had, like, a little - I never got to see, like, a baby grow up or anything like that. It's never occurred to me to have children or to want children.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Comedian and writer Neal Brennan speaking with Terry Gross earlier this year. After a break, he'll talk about working with Dave Chappelle to create and write Chappelle's Show and what it was like when Dave Chappelle abruptly left that comedy series. And film critic Justin Chang reviews the new movie Berlin Syndrome. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF JIMMY OWENS' BRIGHT MISSISSIPPI)\\n\\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, in for Terry Gross, back with more of Terry's interview from February with comic, writer and director Neal Brennan. With Dave Chappelle, he co-founded and co-wrote the sketch comedy series Chappelle's Show. He's directed episodes of Inside Amy Schumer. And earlier this year, he worked on the The Daily Show and released a solo comedy special on Netflix, which is still available to view. It's called 3 Mics because onstage in the show, he uses three different microphones - one for one-liners, one for stand-up and one for stories about his life, including stories about dealing with clinical depression and growing up with a father who was an abusive alcoholic.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: In your show, you talk about how you say to your father - when he was sick, before he died you say to him, I feel like you didn't love us, your children. And your father thinks about it and says, yeah, I didn't. What do you do with that? What do you do with your father actually telling you that what you suspected is true - that he didn't really love his children?\\n\\nBRENNAN: It felt good because it was clarifying. It was like finding the solution to the mystery. Everyone would always say - I would say, like, I don't think my dad loves me. And people would go like, of course your dad loves you. He's your dad, of course he does. And I'd be like, no, I'm pretty sure he doesn't. And so for him to say, like, I didn't love you guys was liberating because I was like, OK, great, I'm not crazy because you always feel like you're crazy when you have a parent like that.\\n\\nAnd what I've found from talking about it in the show is there's a lot of that going around that - where people don't feel loved by their parents, and they're like - it's not just not feeling it. It's - you don't feel it because it's not there. I cut - or I - actually, it's a line I forgot to do in the show, which is like - I said, like, love is, like, elemental. Like, it's, you know, it's like wind or heat or something, where you can just feel it, you know? Like, you can feel when someone loves you. And that's a thing - a feeling, I just never got from my father. And people have been super grateful that I just said it in public because a lot of people feel that way, and no one ever really says it. So yeah, so it was - while it was painful, it was way more illuminating than it was painful.\\n\\nGROSS: So when your father told you, yeah, I didn't love you, was that, like, past tense - like, I didn't love you then; I wasn't really prepared to be the father of 10, but now I really appreciate you and love you?\\n\\nBRENNAN: No, Terry, there was no addendum.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBRENNAN: It was just - it was a full sentence. (Laughter) It was, I didn't love you, period. Now, where were we? And then we just - you know what I mean? Like, there was no...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: Now about this weather. Yeah, there was no - there was no - it wasn't a paragraph. It was a full sentence, and then it was on to the next thing.\\n\\nGROSS: I'm assuming you're OK with me laughing about this.\\n\\nBRENNAN: No, yeah, I - of course.\\n\\nGROSS: Easy for me to laugh at your jokes about your father not loving you.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, no, it is funny. It's funny. Like, I mean, it's awful. But it's funny.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. So early when you were - I don't know - in your teens or 20s - I assume this was after you dropped out of film school - you worked the door at a club - at a comedy club in Greenwich Village.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: So you must have met a lot of comics doing that. I think that's how you met Chappelle, right?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, that is how I met Dave. But yeah, the average - I mean, this is in the early '90s, so the average - you know, Jon Stewart was around. Ray Romano was around. Louis was around. Dave Attell was around, Chappelle. That was, like, an average show back then, but none of them were famous.\\n\\nGROSS: So how - when you met Chappelle, what clicked and got you working together?\\n\\nBRENNAN: He - well, we were the only young guys. We were, like, both 17 or 18. So I think we had a shared sensibility in terms of, like - whereas I'd gone to film school, he sort of - we just had similar tastes in movies and, like, what we liked or what we didn't or things that we thought were hacky or things that we thought were, like, done to death or whatever. And we would just talk, and we'd, like, walk around for hours.\\n\\nGROSS: And you did a movie together that didn't do well. And then...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Went your own separate ways. And then got back together for Chappelle's Show. You co-created it with him. What does that mean, came up with the premise together?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. Basically, we pitched a pilot to HBO and Comedy Central. HBO looked at us like we were, like, out of our minds. And then we pitched to Comedy Central. They bought it. And - but we basically just pitched, like, it was sort of - the idea was, like, a joke book come to life. So we would do any sort of idea either one of us had. Dave always called it a joke dispenser.\\n\\nSo it's figuring out - just, like, we had a point. What's the best way to illustrate that point? And we - when we did the pilot, there was no audience. And we did the bloopers from Roots. That was in the pilot.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: We did the Kinko's/PopCopy training video. And I think we did reparations, the reparations news thing. And when we went to series, we decided to do it in front of the - in front of an audience - and which was a great, great way to do it.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Neal Brennan, who co-created Chappelle's Show. Let's hear a clip from Chappelle's Show. This is a sketch in which Dave Chappelle hosts a game show called I Know Black People in which the contestants are drawn from different groups - white, Asian, black. Each contestant claims to know a lot about black people. We'll hear Chappelle introduce the panelists and then ask each of them a question.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, CHAPELLE'S SHOW)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE: I Know Black People.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nDAVE CHAPPELLE: (As Host) Welcome to the show I Know Black People. We take contestants who claim to know black people and put their knowledge of African-American culture to the test. The contestant who answers the most questions, of course, wins our grand prize. Let's bring them out one at a time - now.\\n\\nOur first contestant is a professor of African-American studies and history at Fordham University - the New York City police officer. He's a writer for such black television shows as The Chris Rock Show and Chappelle's Show. OK, our next contestant works in a Korean grocery store, is a DJ and claims to have many black friends. A social worker in Wilmington, Del. - the barber in Brooklyn who claims that 100 percent of his clients are black. Let's play the game.\\n\\nHow can black people rise up and overcome?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (As contestant) How can they rise up and overcome? Well, can they overcome? No.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That is correct.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nMARK D. NAISON: (As contestant) Reparations.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That is acceptable.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (As contestant) This is a rap lyric?\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) No. This - I'm sorry.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (As contestant) Oh, this is a general question.\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) This is an actual question.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (As contestant) All right. That's a - there's a complex answer there.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That is correct.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (As contestant) Staying alive.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That is correct. That is correct.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (As contestant) Well, stop cutting each other's throat.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That also is correct.\\n\\nHow can black people rise up and overcome?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (As contestant) Get out and vote?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)\\n\\nCHAPPELLE: (As Host) That is incorrect.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nGROSS: I'll talk more about Chappelle's Show as well as other things with comic, writer and director Neal Brennan after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BEASTIE BOYS', GROOVE HOLMES)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with comic, writer and director Neal Brennan. He has a new Netflix comedy special called 3 Mics. With Dave Chappelle, he co-created and co-wrote the sketch comedy series Chappelle's Show.\\n\\nYou had an agreement with Chappelle not to divulge who wrote what.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: Why was that important to you?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Except for the goodbye - hello-fried-chicken joke...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right. Yeah.\\n\\nBRENNAN: ...That masterpiece. It was important. I knew from writing the movie that didn't do well called Half Baked that didn't do well in the box office but, like, it's still popular. I knew when we wrote together that he would get all the credit in comedy, and I would get all the credit in showbiz.\\n\\nSo like in comedy clubs, it would be - like, someone's referred to me as Dave's typist in the past. Like, that he would get all the credit because he was a really well-known comedian. And I would get all the credit in showbiz because I was the - white had to with it. I was a white person, so therefore, they're predisposed to give me credit over a black guy. And I was also, like, the writer. And the - in LA, the writer is, like, the sort of organized taskmaster and the one who organizes the talent's voice, Dave being the talent.\\n\\nBecause they don't - people don't want to believe that you're both talented. They want to believe that there's a simple explanation of, like, Neal's Dave's typist, or Dave's this crazy genius that Neal types for, or Neal is this puppet master who is telling Dave what to say and how to say it and where to say it. And both are insulting. So I was like, let's just keep it anonymous so that people can't, you know, kind of divide and conquer. And it's just a respect thing. It's like, how do I keep my respect? And how do I keep it so that Dave gets respect?\\n\\nGROSS: So since so many sketches were about race, did you and Chappelle have a lot of, like, deep discussions about race?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. And - but the thing is, we'd been having them. We'd been having them since 1992, you know. Like, I knew him when the Rodney King verdict came out. I knew him when the O.J. verdict came out. Like, I think I'd spent the - I think I had dinner with him the night the O.J. verdict came out. I remember when Rodney King happened - he was in LA. I remember talking to him, like, that day or the next day.\\n\\nSo we'd been having long, deep discussions and - that were kind of ongoing. Like, there were sketches we did - like, we did a Real World sketch. And that's a discussion we'd been having for eight years by that point, how black people are portrayed on certain reality shows. So, yeah - so these were no - it wasn't like, oh, we have a show; we better talk about race. Dave's wife, at one point, said all you - and said to Dave - all you and Neal talk about is girls and work, work being race in this case. Like, that's kind of all we would ever talk about, was sort of gender and race, so it was a natural extension of an ongoing conversation.\\n\\nGROSS: Now, my impression from things I read was that Chappelle, at some point, thought that white people were misinterpreting the sketches and maybe sometimes, like, laughing at him instead of with him on certain things. Can you clarify that?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. I think, you know, it's hard when something goes out to that broad an audience. You can't control what people make of it. The most troublesome example of this was we were in - me and Dave were in Tempe, Ariz., and we were at a nightclub. And some sort of dusty, white dude came up and was like, hey, man, I like that sketch about the blind white supremacist who leaves his wife because she's a [expletive] lover. And it was just, ugh - like, literally - like, even just saying it just now, my, like - I get the chills. It's so - it makes me so uncomfortable. And it's one of those things where it's like, so what do you do? Do you stop? You can't control how people interpret things.\\n\\nGROSS: Right. And the sketch that you're talking about was about a blind white supremacist who, because he's blind, doesn't realize he's actually black (laughter).\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes. It's like an eviscerating...\\n\\nGROSS: So he's insulting his - himself without realizing it.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes, exactly. He's black and then leaves his wife because she likes black people.\\n\\nGROSS: Right.\\n\\nBRENNAN: It's like they really...\\n\\nGROSS: And the larger thing here is that, like, people who are racist are stupid, they're not seeing.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. And sure enough, that's what happened. So there were a few things like that where it's like, you know, what do you do if you're a black artist? And I think a lot of black artists reckon with this. It's like what do you do? Do you just keep doing your thing and accept that there's going to be a certain amount of the audience that has - doesn't understand what you're doing at all? Or do you kind of fold it up and go, if you don't - this is too important for you to misinterpret, so I can't risk it? - you know, which in some ways is, I think, the path that Dave took, which is like I can't deal with this misinterpretation. It's too - it means too much to me, and it's too painful that there are...\\n\\nGROSS: Do you think that's why he kind of left the show and went to South Africa?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, I think so. I think it's - that's - I think it was like a - it was a lot of stuff, but I think that was one of them, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: And...\\n\\nBRENNAN: And that was - and the - because he went to South Africa - because he went to Africa and there was a white person, I think I got labeled as that white person. And it was like, no, we were writing sketches the day before. We were fine. Like, we were getting along fine. There was no racial tension between us. But that was a tough situation for me emotionally, too - him - like, me doing a - co-creating a show and then the show just dissolving in a day.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, he didn't tell you he was leaving, right?\\n\\nBRENNAN: No, he didn't. And he - I was on set waiting for him when I found out he was in Africa. I didn't know he was gone until he was gone.\\n\\nGROSS: That must have been very strange for you to have something so abrupt and so important - I mean, it was a long friendship.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, it was a - it was painful on a lot of levels. It was painful in that this thing that I'd made with him was now - I knew when he was gone that the show was over. It wasn't like, oh, he'll come back, then - I just knew, like, OK, that's like - that - I know what that means. And yeah, it was painful on a personal level.\\n\\nIt had been painful before then, but it wasn't, like, racially painful. It was just painful. It was kind of personally painful in that when we had to renegotiate with Comedy Central, it was basically a divide-and-conquer thing. And we were divided and conquered. I think I was conquered, I think. There was some contractual stuff that was really painful, and that was more - that was - the going to Africa thing was just, like, the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\nGROSS: You have said for a long time that you might become friends again, but you'd probably never work together again. But right after the election when Chappelle hosted Saturday Night Live, you wrote one of the sketches. So how did you get to work with him again on Saturday Night Live?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Well, we've been friends. And, you know, when I did 3 Mics, he was very supportive. He came when I did it in Montreal. He came when I did it in LA, and then he came to the opening in New York. And I was grateful because it's, you know - I think because of the way Chappelle's Show ended, I get branded as kind of either racist or I'm a jerk to Dave or all this stuff. And it's like, no, me and Dave - like, so the - like, Dave's fans would be sort of - had sort of a bad feeling about me.\\n\\nAnd I think by him coming to the show and getting his picture taken with me and all this stuff and sort of endorsing it, it was sort of like - hey, just so you know, me and Neal are cool, and we've been cool. So I was grateful for that. And then when he was hosting Saturday Night Live, he, you know, asked me to help. And I was - I - you know, I want to see him do well. And the way that that sketch came about was - it was the week of the election. So on Wednesday, I came in to write a sketch with Colin Jost. And we wrote - at, like, noon we wrote the election night sketch that Chris Rock ended up being in. And it was a - it turned out to be a good sketch.\\n\\nGROSS: This is a sketch where everybody's watching TV on election night. And they're rooting for Hillary, and she's losing state by state. And they keep thinking - well, if she just wins Pennsylvania, all she has to do is win Ohio. And (laughter)...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, which was kind of what we were all doing.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Their hopes keep getting dashed, yeah.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah, which was - I literally said the line - 'cause me and Jost were on some kind of conference call at 5:30 on Tuesday of Election Day. It's 5:30 in the afternoon, and Frank Luntz said that Hillary was going to win by 5. So we were like, OK. So we get off the call, and I go, yeah, you know, there may never be another Republican president based on - like, literally just saying things I'd read in The Atlantic, you know, and just being, like, a liberal, white stereotype. And then - so then the next day, we put all that sort of stupidity into the sketch. Or the naivete, I'd say is what it was.\\n\\nGROSS: And you gave it a really interesting racial edge, too. Would you explain?\\n\\nBRENNAN: Oh, yeah. Well, that actually came from Dave. So we - in the first draft that we read at read-through, that me and Jost wrote that afternoon, it was kind of Dave just being - kind of playing devil's advocate. Like, really? That's your worst-case scenario, just sort of like - and then he - after read-through, Dave was like, just make it a little bit, like, blacker. And then Chris signed on. I think, like, on Thursday or Friday, he said he'd do it. So then we added some lines for him when he got there Saturday. And so yeah - so it turned out - it worked out well.\\n\\nGROSS: And the kind of bottom line of the sketch, in a way, is - if you think that Donald Trump winning and Hillary losing is the worst thing that's ever happened to this country...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. It's the - this is the most shameful...\\n\\nGROSS: The implicit in that was, like, let's remember...\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: Let's remember slavery for a moment.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Yeah. There's a few slavery references, like where - there's a thing where Dave says, like, yeah, I remember my grandfather telling me that. He was a slave. You know, like, sort of, like, reminding white people like - no, no, no. This is like the - this is - there's this thing of, like, this isn't America. It's like, I don't know. I think this is America. Like, we counted the votes, and this is America.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, Neal Brennan, thank you so much for talking with us. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nBRENNAN: Terry, like I said, couldn't be a bigger fan. This is like a dream come true. So I really, really appreciate you having me on.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Comic and writer Neal Brennan speaking to Terry Gross in February. His stand-up comedy special, 3 Mics, is available on Netflix.

{"original": "Mike Bloomberg Can't Shake The Legacy Of Stop-And-Frisk Policing In New York\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 2:39 p.m. ET on Feb. 26\\n\\nFormer New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has repeatedly said he regrets the police tactic known as stop-and-frisk. Still, CBS moderator Gayle King pressed him at Tuesday night's Democratic debate asking, What exactly are you apologizing for?\\n\\nI've apologized and asked for forgiveness, Bloomberg responded at the debate in Charleston, S.C. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\\n\\nBut King pressed again: What more can you do about this issue, Mr. Mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? It continues to follow you.\\n\\nThe exchange underscores Bloomberg's struggle to run away from the legacy of stop-and-frisk, which disproportionately targeted young men of color.\\n\\nDuring Bloomberg's 12 years as mayor, police in New York stopped and frisked roughly 5 million people — most of them young black and Latino men from some of the city's roughest neighborhoods. The vast majority had done nothing wrong. In 2013, the year Bloomberg left office, a federal judge ruled that the NYPD was violating the constitutional rights of black and brown New Yorkers.\\n\\nBloomberg needs the forgiveness of African American and Latino voters if he's going to win the Democratic nomination. His campaign is running high-budget ads, and touting endorsements from African American leaders.\\n\\nAnd yet, the issue continues to follow him.\\n\\nFor years, Bloomberg defended the policy, even after leaving office. It wasn't until he launched his presidential bid that he said he regrets the policy. It's a reversal that some people just don't buy.\\n\\nIt's very absurd, and just arrogance, said Nicholas Peart, who was a plaintiff in the landmark federal lawsuit against the New York's stop-and-frisk policy. Peart says he was stopped by New York police officers at least 10 times.\\n\\nI remember squad cars pulling up. They just pulled up aggressively, and the cops came out with their guns drawn, Peart told NPR in 2013. It left me embarrassed, humiliated and upset — all three things rolled up into one.\\n\\nPeart now works in Harlem at a nonprofit organization that serves low-income kids.\\n\\nI cannot forgive Mayor Bloomberg, Peart said. If you aren't able to protect the constitutional rights of New Yorkers, how can you protect the constitutional rights of all Americans?\\n\\nAt Tuesday night's debate, Bloomberg repeated the claim that his administration brought the number of stops down by 95%.\\n\\nActually, Bloomberg did not end the widespread use of stop-and-frisk, even as the protests and legal challenges mounted. Neither did former Vice President Joe Biden, who tried to claim credit for the Obama administration's doing so, at an earlier debate in Nevada.\\n\\nBoth guys were really saying, 'The plummet in the numbers was due to me,'  said retired federal Judge Shira Scheindlin, who issued the ruling against the New York Police Department in 2013.\\n\\nI wrote the ruling, so I guess it was me, Sheindlin said in an interview this week at her office in Manhattan.\\n\\nSheindlin said she considers stop-and-frisk a failed policy. After all, crime continued to fall even after her ruling. But she believes that Bloomberg's motives were pure.\\n\\nHe meant well, Scheindlin said. However, I think he never understood the human toll. He didn't get it. That's all. Doesn't make him a bad man. To me, doesn't make him a racist. But he was blind.\\n\\nNot all New Yorkers are willing to give Bloomberg that benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nNo neighborhood in the city saw more stops under the Bloomberg administration than the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn. Jacqueline Alexander has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and says Bloomberg should have known the policy would lead to discrimination.\\n\\nYou know, a person like Bloomberg must understand policy, Alexander said. How can you not understand the impact of stop-and-frisk in an environment where mass incarceration is such a big problem?\\n\\nOther residents said they felt safer when Bloomberg was the mayor. In fact, Reggie Tinnin says he would like to see stop-and-frisk make a comeback.\\n\\nHonestly, I think, you know, they should be doing it now, Tinnin said. It seems like the police don't pay attention anymore. They wait til something happen, then they come.\\n\\nEven some of Bloomberg's critics may be willing to give him another chance. Take J.R. Clause, who works in the neighborhood as a family doctor.\\n\\nI think right now, a lot of people are gonna overlook a lot of things, Clause said, including Bloomberg's record on stop-and-frisk. If you weigh that against defeating Donald Trump, they'll close their eyes to that and go after Trump."}
{"original": "Executive Order Or Memorandum? Let's Call The Whole Thing An 'Action'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIt's been a busy week for President Trump's pen.\\n\\nSince taking the oath of office on Jan. 20, Trump has signed more than a dozen executive orders and memorandums in an effort to jump-start his policy agenda and begin to deliver on some of the promises he made during the campaign.\\n\\nBut why is the president's directive to build a wall considered an executive order, whereas greenlighting the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines are memorandums? And how is all of that different from issuing an executive action?\\n\\nThe authority to issue executive orders and memorandums doesn't appear in the Constitution, and that's partly why the definitions are a little hazy, according to the Congressional Research Service. Nevertheless, the authority to issue both is considered an inherent aspect of presidential power.\\n\\nAn order is a call for the executive branch to take a specific action or to change an existing practice, explains Phillip J. Cooper, a professor of public administration in the Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University in Portland, Ore.\\n\\nIf the president has the authority to issue that directive, whether from the Constitution or statute, then it becomes legally binding. However, Cooper says, if there's a clear piece of legislation that says, 'No you can't do this,' a president can't pick up a pen and get around it. In essence, a president can't sign an executive order that violates existing law.\\n\\nOnce a president signs an executive order, it's sent to the Federal Register for an identifying number, and then published.\\n\\nThat's a key step that isn't legally required with executive memorandums.\\n\\nThere are no legal processes required for issuing a memorandum, Cooper says. A president doesn't have to do anything, doesn't even have to publish it if he or she doesn't want to. With an executive order, presidents must publish. The Obama administration started publishing public memorandums on the White House website, and the Trump administration has followed suit. But, Cooper says, that is something they choose to do, and what's available on the website now may not include all of the new administration's memorandums.\\n\\nPlanet Money How A Law Is Implemented Depends On A President's Rules How A Law Is Implemented Depends On A President's Rules Listen · 4:19 4:19\\n\\nExecutive orders and memorandums are often conflated. In the last few administrations, particularly since the Clinton years, presidents started using the two interchangeably, says Cooper.\\n\\nIn a January 2000 memo to then-President Bill Clinton, the Justice Department wrote, It is our opinion that there is no substantive difference in the legal effectiveness of an executive order and a presidential directive that is not styled as an executive order.\\n\\nWhile presidents have treated executive memorandums as just as binding as executive orders, Cooper says, there really is not a clear body of case law or statutes on that.\\n\\nAs for executive actions, Cooper says the phrase is very generic. He explains that executive actions are merely a category of different policy tools that presidents often use — including executive orders and memorandums — that has no separate legal meaning itself.\\n\\nRegardless of the word appearing after executive, if his first week in office is any indication, it seems President Trump's pen won't be getting a rest any time soon."}
{"original": "Senate Passes $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Package\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 11:47 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a $2 trillion relief package Wednesday night designed to alleviate some of the worst effects of the swift economic downturn currently underway as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nAhead of the 96-0 vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told lawmakers, Our nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory.\\n\\nAs of Wednesday evening, there were 65,000 diagnosed cases of the highly contagious virus in the U.S. and more than 900 deaths.\\n\\nThe legislation now before us is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\\n\\nThe plan marks the largest rescue package in American history. The legislation covers an array of programs, including direct payments to Americans, an aggressive expansion of unemployment insurance, billions of dollars in aid to large and small businesses, and a new wave of significant funding for the health care industry.\\n\\nThe agreement is an expansion of a Republican legislative proposal issued last week, dubbed the CARES Act — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — to provide relief to virtually every rung of the U.S. economic ladder.\\n\\nAmong the deal's key provisions:\\n\\nThe plan will rush financial assistance to Americans with direct checks to households in the middle class and in lower income levels, McConnell said. Previously, Republicans said this would amount to $1,200 to most American adults, among other payments.\\n\\nAn extended unemployment insurance program for laid-off workers that will allow for four months of full pay, according to Schumer, rather than the usual three months for most. It will also raise the maximum unemployment insurance benefit by $600 per week. It will apply to traditional workers for small and large businesses as well as those who are self-employed and workers in the gig economy. This was a key Democratic initiative, which Schumer dubbed unemployment insurance on steroids.\\n\\nMore than $150 billion for the health care system, including funding for hospitals, research, treatment and the Strategic National Stockpile to raise supplies of ventilators, masks and other equipment. Of that, $100 billion will go to hospitals and the health system and $1 billion to the Indian Health Service.\\n\\n$150 billion to state and local governments to address spending shortages related to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\n$350 billion in the form of loans for small businesses impacted by the pandemic; some of those loans could be forgiven.\\n\\nThe House will take up the measure on Friday, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). To protect members from the risks of exposure, the House will hold a voice vote on the bill.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump and top members of his administration gave their strong support to the bill Wednesday.\\n\\nWe couldn't be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing, flanked by Trump, Vice President Pence and others.\\n\\nTrump emphasized Wednesday that would immediately sign the bill once passed by both houses of Congress.\\n\\nA group of Senate Republicans — Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Ben Sasse and Rick Scott — had voiced last-minute concerns, saying the bill's unemployment assistance provision would allow jobless Americans to make more money under unemployment than if they were working normally.\\n\\nThey were given a vote on an amendment to pare back the unemployment benefits but the measure failed on the Senate floor Wednesday shortly before the bill's final passage.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, McConnell touted the bipartisan deal reached overnight to provide cash payments to Americans, help to struggling small businesses and more resources to state and local governments, as well as to hospitals.\\n\\nHe also acknowledged it was only one part of the overall response needed.\\n\\nNobody thinks legislation can end this [coronavirus crisis], McConnell said Wednesday. We cannot outlaw the virus. And no economic policy can fully end the hardship so long as the public health requires that we put so much of our commerce on ice. This isn't even a stimulus package. It is emergency relief. That's what this is.\\n\\nMcConnell noted that much of the $2 trillion legislation is built on the proposal that Senate Republicans unveiled on Sunday, and he downplayed changes Democrats were touting. He said he would leave it to others to decide whether the last few changes merited three days of delay in the face of this worsening crisis.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged the House would not be able to pass the Senate bill by unanimous consent – a process she wanted to use to avoid calling members back to the Capitol as more lawmakers are self-quarantining due to exposure to the virus. She said leaders pledged to give 24 hours' notice ahead of the vote and said on CNN we can take a voice vote if someone calls for a recorded vote then we're prepared to go in that direction as well.\\n\\nHouse Republicans are strongly behind the measure, according to a senior GOP leadership congressional source.\\n\\nThe deal comes after days of intense negotiations and false starts among McConnell, Schumer and Mnuchin. McConnell and Schumer announced news of a breakthrough on the Senate floor shortly after 1:30 a.m. Wednesday.\\n\\nLast weekend, Democrats had walked away from bipartisan talks among senators in favor of negotiating more directly with Mnuchin and the White House to get a final deal that reflected more of their priorities.\\n\\nMcConnell chafed at the tactics but supported the end result. It's taken a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric to get us here, he said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.\\n\\nThis is the third piece of bipartisan legislation this month to address the coronavirus pandemic, with two emergency stimulus bills already signed into law. But this latest deal eclipses the earlier packages in scope and spending.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Democrats delayed negotiations because they wanted to include more conditions on the loan fund for corporations, more money for hospitals and more generous unemployment benefits. Democrats secured concessions on all three in the final deal.\\n\\nThe plan also includes several Democratic oversight initiatives. Among those, it creates a Treasury Department special inspector general for pandemic recovery and a Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to oversee loans to businesses.\\n\\nIt also prohibits businesses controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress and heads of executive departments from participating in the loan or investment programs, Schumer's office said. In addition, children, spouses and other relatives will also be banned, it said.\\n\\nThere are also provisions to ban stock buybacks for the term of government assistance, plus an additional year for any company receiving a government loan from the bill. In addition, it establishes worker protections attached to federal loans for businesses, and it prohibits airlines from using the funds for CEO bonuses.\\n\\nPelosi recently negotiated the second coronavirus package directly with Mnuchin and without McConnell's involvement. That package, estimated to cost more than $100 billion, provided for new paid sick leave benefits and funds to expedite access to coronavirus testing. Republicans were tepid about the package, but Trump endorsed it and it ultimately passed Congress with the support of 90% of lawmakers in both chambers."}

Yet President-elect Trump stands to inherit the nation's longest war ever in Afghanistan, as well as renewed fighting in Iraq that has spread to Syria.\\n\\nThe outgoing president was reminded of the persistence of those wars at the pomp-filled farewell ceremony the Pentagon put on for him him earlier this month at a nearby military base.\\n\\nMr. President, we've been at war throughout your tenure, said Gen. Joesph Dunford, chosen by Obama in 2015 to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

That's not what Obama wanted or expected.\\n\\nBut he reminded the troops seeing him off that thanks to a new approach he's taken to those wars, the number of American forces involved in them has dropped sharply.\\n\\nNot by letting our forces get dragged into sectarian conflicts and civil wars, but with smart, sustainable, principled partnerships, Obama said of the strategy he's shifted to of training, advising and assisting local forces to do the ground fighting. That's how we brought most of our troops home — from nearly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan down to 15,000 today.\\n\\nFewer forces, but protracted conflict\\n\\nPolitics Obama Slows Withdrawal Of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan Again Obama Slows Withdrawal Of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan Again Listen · 2:58 2:58\\n\\nOf those remaining in the field, 8,400 U.S. forces are in Afghanistan. That's still more than the small residual force Obama had aimed to leave behind.\\n\\nSome of those American forces in Afghanistan are fighting 13 different groups that the U.S. considers terrorists. Others are training and advising Afghan security forces to fight the Taliban, which Washington does not formally consider a terrorist organization.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Welna/NPR David Welna/NPR\\n\\nWhen you look at the performance of the Afghan forces this year, it was a tough year, said Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, at a December news conference held at Bagram Airfield. They were tested, but they prevailed.\\n\\nOthers take a dimmer view of the effort to shift the lead in fighting the Taliban to Afghanistan's security forces.\\n\\nIt's basically playing whack-a-mole, says John Sopko, who since 2012 has been the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.\\n\\nWhile presenting SIGAR's latest report at a military think tank in Washington earlier this month, Sopko described the Afghan National Security Forces as hobbled by corruption and poor leadership.\\n\\nWe're defining success by the absence of failure, Sopko said of those forces' ongoing attempts to retake territory lost to the Taliban. At a minimum, they're playing defense, and are not taking the fight to the Taliban.\\n\\nWhat's more, a war that began with a U.S. invasion 15 years ago in October 2001 appears to have no end in sight.\\n\\nThe situation in Afghanistan, in the rosiest possible reasonable analysis, is a stalemate, said Stephen Biddle, a military analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations and George Washington University.

They are losing their leaders, towns and cities are being liberated, and I have no doubt this barbaric terrorist group will be destroyed — because of you.\\n\\nLast month the top U.S. commander in Iraq, speaking at a fire base just outside Mosul that was held by Islamic State forces as recently as July, defended what many see as a slow-motion assault on the Islamic State forces holding that city.\\n\\nAny army on the planet, to include the United States Army, would be challenged by this fight, said Gen. Stephen Townsend. The Iraqi army has come back from near defeat two years ago, and now they're attacking this major city.\\n\\nIn neighboring, war-ravaged Syria, at least 600 U.S. Special Forces are now on the ground, mainly to train and assist local rebel forces. The ultimate aim is to oust Islamic State fighters from Raqqa, the capital of the group's self-declared caliphate.\\n\\nSome experts doubt such an approach — arming and training an array of Syrians from often competing factions — will work.\\n\\nWe're losing, they're winning, says the Brooking Institution's Michael O'Hanlon. They maybe don't say it in quite those terms, because they like the fact that we're still pulling the wool collectively over our own eyes, but the idea of defeating ISIS, replacing (Syrian President Bashar) Assad, and doing all this with a minimal American military investment, does not add up to a logical policy.\\n\\nAs for the incoming president, it's not clear how he'll fight these inherited wars. Trump barely mentioned Afghanistan during his campaign. It's also unclear how he'd handle the anti-Islamic State campaign in Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nOne clue may be found in what retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, told NPR last summer.\\n\\nWhere is the king of Jordan, where's the emirs of some of these other countries?, Flynn asked rhetorically about nations in the region he felt should be doing more to fight the Islamic State. They need to actually stand up and, internationally and publicly, condemn this violent form of this ideology that is operating inside of their bloodstream right now — and I don't see it. And that's where the president of the United States needs to place a different set of demands on these guys.\\n\\nWhen Flynn uttered those words, Trump was just the Republican nominee for the White House. The now-president-elect's recommended strategy for fighting the Islamic State had been characteristically blunt.\\n\\nI would just bomb those suckers, Trump told a campaign rally in Iowa shortly before that state's caucuses a year ago.\\n\\nAs president and commander in chief, Trump soon will have the power to do so."}
{"original": "Questions And Answers About Opioids And Chronic Pain\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hero Images/Getty Images Hero Images/Getty Images\\n\\nMillions of Americans use opioids to relieve pain. But many also struggle with addiction.\\n\\nThis week, a report in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, found that nonopioid painkillers — like acetaminophen and ibuprofen — were as effective as opioids at treating chronic back, hip and knee pain, and with fewer side effects.\\n\\nThe findings raise a lot of questions about the right approach to managing pain, particularly chronic pain. So earlier this week, we asked listeners on Facebook and Twitter to share their questions about treating chronic pain.\\n\\nFor answers, NPR's Ari Shapiro turned to Dr. Ajay Wasan, professor and vice chair for pain medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\\n\\nQuestions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nIsn't it true that ... acetaminophen can be very damaging to the liver, particularly with daily long-term use? — Emma Juneau\\n\\nFor treatment of chronic pain, especially arthritis pain, higher doses of acetaminophen have been recommended, and there are good studies supporting that it can be quite effective for pain. You get a cumulative effect with the higher doses.\\n\\nThose can also be associated with a rise in liver enzymes for some people. It would be very rare for those enzymes to reach a toxic level that would cause liver damage, but we don't know what percent of people get that little rise in liver enzymes, or the chances that a slight increase in liver enzymes will lead to liver damage.\\n\\nIt raises a very excellent point, that nonopiate medications have some side effects as well. We know anti-inflammatories can have significant side effects — in general the side effects of opioids are greater — but both nonopioids and opioids do have side effects.\\n\\nWhy isn't acupuncture part of the discussion as an alternative for opioids? It seems like a simple, noninvasive, nonaddictive alternative to painkillers, but most insurance plans don't cover it for this purpose. Is there any work being done to evaluate its effectiveness? — Rachel Esser of Tampa, Fla.\\n\\nThere's a lot of research going on for the effectiveness and the mechanisms for acupuncture. The literature suggests that for chronic low back pain, and chronic knee arthritis pain, acupuncture can be effective. Just like many treatments for chronic pain, it tends to be a subset of people, approximately 20-30 percent, that get significant improvement with acupuncture.\\n\\nAnd it's a good point as to why it's not better covered, because many of our treatments for chronic pain really only confer improvement to 20 to 30 percent of people. We often have to try different things and combine different treatments — the term we use is multimodal pain treatment.\\n\\nThe other thing is this issue of insurance coverage. A lot of physicians, like myself, have pushed for that, and there are a few more progressive insurance companies that are starting to cover acupuncture. University of Pittsburgh medical center does have some coverage for acupuncture in their health plan, but it's an outlier.\\n\\nAnother listener points out that physical therapy, which can help ease pain, is far more expensive than an opioid prescription. Is there an important role for insurers here?\\n\\nThis is a wonderful point, and it's such a vexing issue for anyone who treats chronic pain. Some of the treatments that have been proven more effective, and safer, and have better outcomes, such as physical therapy, may have a $20 to $40 copay, for each visit, versus an opioid which might have a $5 copay for an entire month's supply.\\n\\nSo it's a huge problem that insurance companies, I think, need to contend with across the country. There are all sorts of hidden additional costs with prescribing an opioid, and in the long run, it may be that using these nonopioid approaches, like physical therapy, and other medications, really provides the best improvement in chronic pain but also lowers costs.\\n\\nI used to take up to three Percocets a day for pain related to surgeries and injuries, but a couple years ago my doctor told me he was being pressured to stop prescribing opioids for chronic pain. So I switched to medical marijuana, and it's working fine. How widely is this being discussed in pain medicine — marijuana instead of opioids? — Gary Price, Colorado\\n\\nThis is a really hot topic in the field of chronic pain. Very recently, the state of Pennsylvania has a medical marijuana law, and it's starting to be available here in Pittsburgh. When you look at all the studies, you see some of the same patterns for the effectiveness of medical marijuana as you see for a lot of our other chronic pain treatments.\\n\\nFor neuropathic pain, which is pain related to nerve damage, or nerves not functioning properly, you can see some evidence for medical marijuana's effectiveness. Some patients do respond, and do get better, but it's only about 20 or 30 percent on average. It's amazing how that figure creeps up on many of the chronic pain treatments we have — 20 to 30 percent of patients will get a significant response.\\n\\nThe other point is this idea of using medical marijuana instead of opioids. There's very little data on that, but it's an issue that many pain specialists are starting to explore. If it's reasonable to certify someone on medical marijuana, can you use that as a way to decrease the use of opioids?\\n\\nSince there's a wide menu of options besides opioids, why do you think millions of Americans every year use opioids — and likely a much smaller number of people are using all of these other things that we're talking about?\\n\\nThe recent study in JAMA gets to this issue nicely.\\n\\nA key message from that study is that if you're treating chronic pain, and you prescribe opioids or nonopioids, both groups of patients get significantly better. More than 50 percent in both groups had significant improvements in pain or function.\\n\\nSo you can understand why opioids might be prescribed first, because they still are, and always will be, regarded as some of the most powerful analgesics that we have.\\n\\nThere's a second part to this: If the nonopioid medications and modalities, like physical therapy, aren't readily available to patients, and the resources aren't there for comprehensive pain treatment, then you can imagine that the default option becomes opioids. Patients do get better on them. It may not be a very long lasting effect, we don't know. But that may be the only tool, sadly, that many physicians have available to them at the time.\\n\\nAfter my husband had surgery, the discharge doctor wrote him a 30-day opioid prescription. When I asked her, Why are you prescribing 30 days? she said, Well, that's just how it's done.\\n\\nI was pretty shocked by this. What kind of education or policy or procedures are being put in place for discharging physicians or others? — Linda, North Carolina, who asked that we not use her last name to protect her family's privacy\\n\\nThis is a really hot topic in the fields of surgery and anesthesiology, and there have been a number of studies that have come out in the past few years looking exactly at this issue, and trying to get at the exact amount of time that someone should be prescribed opioids after surgery. It may vary by surgery.\\n\\nIt's an issue that many, many health care systems, including ours, are really tackling to avoid prolonged opioid use after surgery.\\n\\nNow that the opioid crisis is on everyone's mind, why do I feel like a bad person? Why am I looked at suspiciously by medical personnel? Am I wrong to want to continue taking the drug that alleviates my torturous pain? — Barbara Huffman, Lawrenceville, Ga.\\n\\nWe see this so much as pain specialists, that patients who have been on appropriate doses of opioids, for appropriate time, and doing very well, having good pain control, do get stigmatized. And that's an important negative consequence of the opioid epidemic and the increased scrutiny.\\n\\nPatients that are prescribed opioids for pain are not the same as people who use opioids for the psychoactive effect, such as using them to get high.\\n\\nOf course there are people with chronic pain who can become addicted, but that is a very tiny subset, really, of patients.\\n\\nI've taken prescription opioids for 15 years, after trying many other options. Opiates have been a godsend to a certain factor of the population that suffers horrible pain. We are not terminal cancer patients; we are people with a life ahead of us if only we could live it. We, the patients, are terrified of being swept up in the storm of opiate rejection and having our medicines taken away from us. Should people be worried? — Helen Stevens, Hagerstown, Md.\\n\\nOne of the key things that the recent study in JAMA, and others, try and can't answer ... is ... what do you do if the nonopioids don't work? Is it reasonable to put people on opioids?\\n\\nAnd there is literature that suggests yes. All pain specialists have patients in their practice who do well on opioids for many years; many of them are on lower doses and do not have tolerance.\\n\\nIt's all about this issue of responders and nonresponders. When you read studies, they average everyone together. So some people do well on opioids and some people do poorly, but there's always a spread. And that's a key thing that's missing from the debate, and the controversy.\\n\\nThere are responders and nonresponders, and we need to do a better job of identifying them, and also spreading that word to physicians, that there are people who can be on opioids for many years without having any problems with addiction or abuse.\\n\\nMy mother has been taking hydrocodone for the last five years for everything from back pain from a car accident to chronic migraines. Aside from IBS, what long-term health effects are there to consider? — Ryan McMillan, Texas\\n\\nSo there are a lot of long-term side effects, potentially. Some of them are dose related, but there aren't that many studies tracking people who are on opioids for more than 12 months.\\n\\nBesides the gastrointestinal effects, decreased testosterone can affect men and women, and that might lead to early osteoporosis. You can have other effects on your adrenal gland, and your ability to make cortisol. It can affect the immune system, so the immune system doesn't get compromised, but immunity as a whole does not seem as strong. These are associations, so there's no causality, but long-term opioid use is associated with a slightly higher risk of cancer.\\n\\nOpioids can increase the chances that people can become depressed, if they have chronic pain. That's a difficult thing to tease out, but even when you account for all these various associations between pain and depression, it does seem that the opioids themselves are associated with a higher rate of developing depression. Because they are, as a class of drugs, depressants.\\n\\nThe audio version of this interview was edited and produced by NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin and Andrea Hsu."}
{"original": "FDA Grants Experimental Coronavirus Drug Benefits For Rare Disease Treatments\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave an experimental medicine called remdesivir to treat COVID-19 what's called orphan drug status on Monday.\\n\\nTo qualify for an orphan designation, drug companies must show that their product will treat a population of fewer than 200,000 patients or that it would be unprofitable.\\n\\nWith more than 52,000 confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of Tuesday afternoon, the illness is under the technical threshold for a rare disease. But cases are rising quickly and it seems inevitable that they will surpass 200,000.\\n\\nThe agency's decision would provide lucrative incentives to the drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, and could keep lower-priced generic versions of the medicine off the market for several years if remdesivir is approved for use, public health advocates say.\\n\\nRemdesivir is an intravenous, antiviral medicine that is being studied in clinical trials around the world as a possible treatment for COVID-19.\\n\\nClinical trials for remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment got started in China in early February. Tests of the drug are now enrolling patients elsewhere, including the United States.\\n\\nThe FDA's granting of orphan status for remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 came with financial incentives for Gilead that include tax breaks, waiver of FDA fees and market exclusivity for seven years if the drug is approved. New drug molecules typically only get five years of this exclusivity.\\n\\nThe agency decision drew criticism from consumer advocates.\\n\\nFDA should not provide long-term financial incentives for a treatment that would be very widely used if it works, said Diana Zuckerman, who heads the National Center for Health Research, a consumer advocacy and research organization. The goal of the orphan drug program is to make it more lucrative for a company to develop a treatment that won't have a lot of customers.\\n\\nWith more than 50,000 confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of Tuesday afternoon, the disease is under the technical threshold for a rare disease. The law states that the number of patients must be fewer than 200,000 at the time of the submission of the request for orphan-drug designation.\\n\\nThe FDA told NPR that this is why remdesivir was given orphan status this week, adding that it met the standard criteria for prevalence for designation.\\n\\nIn an emailed statement, a Gilead spokesperson wrote that when it sought the orphan designation, only a small number of Americans were affected by COVID-19. A company spokesperson declined to say when this was. The drug company said it has been making significant at-risk investments to study remdesivir and increase its supply during the global health emergency.\\n\\nIf remdesivir is approved, Gilead's statement said, we are committed to making the medicine both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world.\\n\\nAdvocates voiced concern that the FDA's decision paves the way for Gilead to charge a high price for remdesivir. Many orphan drugs are among the most expensive medications in the United States, in part because generic competitors are delayed.\\n\\nGilead's pursuit of an orphan designation is unconscionable and could be deeply harmful, Peter Maybarduk, who directs Public Citizen's access to medicines program, wrote in a statement. Remdesivir is one of relatively few medicines that may prove effective in treating COVID-19 this year. The government should be urgently concerned with its affordability for citizens.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Public Citizen and 70 other organizations co-authored a letter to President Trump, urging his administration not to award monopolies to pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines and cures. The letter cited Public Citizen's report, which found that taxpayers had already spent $700 million on pharmaceutical research and development for coronaviruses since 2002.\\n\\nDuring a congressional hearing in late February, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to promise that coronavirus treatments would be affordable.\\n\\nWe can't control that price because we need the private sector to invest, he said during the hearing with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\\n\\nThe decision to award remdesivir orphan designation as a treatment for COVID-19 also puzzled Ken Kaitin, who directs the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. If the FDA's goal was to speed development, he said it could do that in other ways.\\n\\nI could see that Gilead would like that, Kaitin said of the orphan drug tax breaks and promise of seven years without generic competitors. But at the same time, it's hard to imagine the FDA would say, OK, we're going to call it an orphan drug even though it's not [rare.]' \\n\\nThe Government Accountability Office finished a yearlong investigation of the FDA's orphan drug program in 2018. It found that the agency wasn't always ensuring that the intent of the Orphan Drug Act was being met. Instead, FDA reviews that determined orphan designation were often inconsistent and incomplete.\\n\\nThe GAO report followed a Kaiser Health News investigation into manipulation of the orphan drug program that showed that many pharmaceuticals that received rare disease perks started off as blockbuster products with millions of customers.\\n\\nStill, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a patient advocacy group, said remdesivir's designation follows the letter of the law.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that, under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA must make designation decisions based on available data at the time the application is submitted, Rachel Sher, the group's vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, said in a statement provided to NPR."}
{"original": "As Pope Holds Sex Abuse Summit, U.S. Catholics Not Hopeful For 'Bold Moves'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gregorio Borgia/AP Gregorio Borgia/AP\\n\\nNever in the history of the Roman Catholic Church has a pope ordered bishops from around the world to come together and consider how many priests abuse children sexually and how many church officials cover for the abusers. The scandal of clergy sex abuse has deep roots in church history, but church leaders have been notoriously reluctant to acknowledge it and deal with the consequences.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, when Pope Francis summoned more than 100 bishops to a meeting in Rome to address the Protection of Minors in the Church, the announcement raised expectations that it could mark a turning point in the Church's lagging response to the ongoing clergy abuse crisis. The three-day meeting begins Thursday.\\n\\nIn the weeks that followed the Pope's announcement, however, U.S. Catholics in particular have become disappointed over his characterization of the summit as a gathering that will merely feature prayer and discernment, hardly an ambitious vision for what could have been a momentous event.\\n\\nThat offers little solace to American Catholics who feel their own church is in need of reform, says Kathleen Sprows Cummings, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. I think the bold moves that a lot of people are going to want to see are very unlikely to happen.\\n\\nI think the bold moves that a lot of people are going to want to see are very unlikely to happen.\\n\\nThe scourge of clergy sex abuse became evident in the United States much earlier than in other countries, and U.S. Catholics have progressed further in their determination to deal with the crisis. Under pressure from abuse survivors and their advocates, numerous dioceses have publicly identified hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct, in order to warn communities that might otherwise not know of their record.\\n\\nSuch scrutiny has extended to U.S. bishops, especially after an explosive grand jury report in 2018 on the abuse of more than 1,000 children by Catholic clergy in Pennsylvania. The report revealed that bishops in the state weren't just aware of what was going on; they were immersed in it. And they went to great lengths to keep it secret.\\n\\nIn response, U.S. bishops prepared a new set of reforms, including the formation of a special commission to review complaints against bishops who fail to take action to prevent abuse.\\n\\nThe bishops' plans were thwarted in November, however, when Pope Francis said he wanted to deal with the abuse crisis on a global basis and announced his plans for a summit.\\n\\nWe were ready for some proposals, [but] the proposals were not received well by the Holy See, says Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the archbishop of Houston and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. So we were disappointed. But we continue to work, and we hope the [Rome] meeting will be of help.\\n\\nSurvivors demand action\\n\\nWith Pope Francis taking the reform initiative away from U.S. bishops, he now faces the demands of abuse survivors on his own. One group, Survivors' Network of Those Abused by Priests, drafted a letter to the pope demanding action. Having initially focused individually on abusive priests, the group has now redirected its attention to bishops who have allowed priests under their jurisdiction to go unpunished.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tom Gjelten/NPR Tom Gjelten/NPR\\n\\nThere must be a zero-tolerance policy not only for the abuser, but for those who enable abuse as well, the group said in its letter.\\n\\nThose people to me are the bigger criminals, says SNAP board member Becky Ianni, who hand delivered the letter to the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C. They covered up abuse, and they allowed more and more children to be put in harm's way. That breaks my heart.\\n\\nIanni, who was sexually violated by her family priest as a 9-year-old girl, says she and her fellow survivors never had much faith that U.S. bishops would take effective action on their own.\\n\\nThe pope is in control, she says. Cardinals and bishops can't control each other, so if something is going to happen, it's going to have to come from Pope Francis.\\n\\nThere is scant evidence, however, that the Pope is prepared at this week's summit to propose any new accountability measures directed at bishops or cardinals.\\n\\nHe's a pastoral pope. He's not the sheriff of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nIf this meeting were to have any real impact, it would require Pope Francis to come in and lay down the law and say, 'This is what you've got to do. Go home and do it,' says Father Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and frequent commentator on Vatican developments for the Religion News Service. But that's just not his personality. He's a pastoral pope. He's not the sheriff of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nOpportunity for education\\n\\nInstead, Vatican aides say the pope sees the Rome summit as an opportunity for catechesis, or religious education, for the bishops in attendance from around the world.\\n\\nThe goal is that all of the bishops clearly understand what they need to do to prevent and combat the worldwide problem of the sexual abuse of minors, according to Vatican Spokesman Alessandro Gisotti.\\n\\nGiven that Catholic bishops outside the U.S., especially in the Global South, have lagged in their recognition of the abuse crisis, that goal is likely to mean that American Catholics won't find much satisfaction in the aftermath of the Rome meeting.\\n\\nA suggestion from Cardinal Blase Cupich, the Archbishop of Chicago and one of the summit organizers, that the Catholic leadership in the U.S. should align with other church leaders in the world brought a sharp response from Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org.\\n\\nThis would be a step backwards, Doyle says. It would undo years of slow but real progress. While the U.S. bishops' norms need improvement, they are by far more effective than the norms of any other bishops' conference we've studied.\\n\\nThe U.S. reform agenda in response to the clergy abuse crisis has actually moved beyond demands of the church leadership, with more attention to the role that civil law enforcement might play. Several state attorneys general have initiated their own investigations of abuse cases and are demanding that church authorities turn over relevant records.\\n\\nAgainst that background, the Rome summit may have minimal importance for efforts in the United States to deal with the clergy abuse crisis.\\n\\nI would love for the church to commit to saying, 'We're going to find out what happened and come to a reckoning of this,' says Notre Dame's Kathleen Sprows Cummings. I don't see that happening, and at this point, I think we have to look to the civil authorities to do that."}
{"original": "A Look Back At What Happened After The Killing Of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani\\n\\nOne year after the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, NPR correspondents discuss what happened since and what Iran policy might look like under the Biden administration.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nOne year ago this weekend, my producer Becky and I were packing for a reporting trip to Iran. We had a story list a mile long, all these features we were going to do when boom - huge news broke.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: In a major escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the top Iranian general has been killed in an airstrike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: Qassem Soleimani, a revered Iranian general and one of that country's most powerful military leaders, is considered by the U.S. to be a terrorist.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: He'd reportedly just gotten into Iraq from Beirut and was leaving Baghdad airport when he was killed in a convoy of vehicles along with a top Iraqi militia leader.\\n\\nKELLY: A U.S. airstrike had killed Qassem Soleimani. And by the time we landed in Tehran, his portrait was everywhere - on huge billboards on the road in from the airport, painted on the sides of buildings, the front page of every paper.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED GROUP #1: (Singing in non-English language).\\n\\nKELLY: At his funeral, at Tehran University, we waded into crowds holding up signs with the words hard revenge and hey, U.S., you started, we will end it. Suddenly, the possibility of the U.S. and Iran tipping into war felt very real.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: (Chanting in non-English language).\\n\\nKELLY: Well, with the eve of the one-year anniversary upon us, it seemed a good time to look at what has happened and what hasn't in the years since, and what U.S.-Iran relations might look like with a new U.S. president moving into the White House. Here with us now, NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre and NPR's Peter Kenyon, who covers Iran from his base in Istanbul. Hey, you two.\\n\\nPETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\\n\\nGREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\\n\\nKELLY: Peter, let's start with those signs I just described that we saw one year ago on the streets of Tehran - hard revenge. What has that looked like? What has Iran done to avenge Soleimani's death?\\n\\nKENYON: Within days of the assassination, Iran launched Operation Martyr Soleimani, which included a number of missile attacks mainly against the Al Asad base in western Iraq. Iraq had been warned of that attack in advance by Tehran, and there were no U.S. casualties, although eventually the Pentagon said more than a hundred military personnel had suffered traumatic brain injuries. The other response was actually an embarrassment for Tehran when Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a Ukrainian international airlines passenger jet, killing 176. Officials said Iran was on its highest state of military alert, denied responsibility for three days and then said, yes, it was human error.\\n\\nSince then, we've been hearing lots of warnings, regular warnings of further revenge at some point in the future. It's not very clear whether they mean on the anniversary or sometime later. Meanwhile, the attacks keep coming. A nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed in an attack near Tehran in November. Iran blamed Israel, but said the U.S. must have known about it. And of course, historians will note that Iran has made news during presidential transitions before. I mean, the Iranian hostage taking in 1979 - 52 Americans taken from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran is credited with dooming Jimmy Carter's reelection bid and ushering in the Ronald Reagan era.\\n\\nKELLY: We recall, of course, that those hostages were released - right? - a moment of presidential transition as President Carter handed over the White House to Reagan. So parallels from 40 years ago. Let me follow and press you on what Iran has not done. You said we have watched to see if there would be further intense military reaction also on the nuclear front. And they have - in this past year, they've expanded their nuclear capabilities. They have not, though, at least as far as we know, raced towards building a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nKENYON: They haven't. And the nuclear program, it almost seems to be on a separate track. The major event has been the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran agreed to big reductions in its program in exchange for sanctions being lifted. And then in 2018, President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal, reimposed sanctions. A year later, Iran began suspending its commitments, most notably jumping up its enrichment of nuclear fuel, is talking now about trying to get to 20% enrichment, still far from weapons grade. But beyond that, there is only 90% enrichment for a nuclear warhead.\\n\\nKELLY: Greg, let's get you in here, the view from Washington. What does the U.S. say was achieved with the strike on Qassem Soleimani?\\n\\nMYRE: Well, the U.S. eliminated a key Iranian general. He's been blamed for the death of hundreds of Americans over the past couple decades. The U.S. continues to impose sanctions as part of this maximum pressure campaign by President Trump. But the killing really hasn't substantially altered the overall dynamics of the region. I mean, the U.S. and Iran are still in this tense standoff. And we really have a perfect example here. Just in recent days, an Iraqi militia that's believed to be controlled by Iran fired 21 rockets into the Green Zone in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy is based on December 20. And that's exactly the kind of activity that Qassem Soleimani was accused of orchestrating. And it's still taking place now a year after his death.\\n\\nKELLY: You mentioned the maximum pressure campaign, which has been the Trump administration's strategy toward Iran. And it has occurred to me that it presents a challenge for the U.S. Where do you go from maximum pressure?\\n\\nKELLY: Well, I think we can expect Biden to move away from this maximum pressure campaign. I mean, we should note, it's put Iran in a tough spot. The U.S. sanctions, the low oil prices, COVID, a weak currency have all really hemmed in Iran and a lot of ways. But Biden has never been a fan of this, and he's going to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal if Iran is willing. And I spoke about this with Norm Roule. He was a longtime CIA official who was focused on the Middle East and Iran in particular.\\n\\nNORM ROULE: I think the fastest way to return to the deal would be to initiate sort of a freeze for freeze. Iran would freeze additional expansion of its nuclear deal. We would freeze new sanctions against Iran. You could see a phase one agreement occurring.\\n\\nKELLY: So one idea there for how diplomacy with Iran might resume under a Biden administration. Peter, quick - just response to you from what we were hearing there for Greg on the state of U.S. allies. This has been a big plank of Trump administration policy has been trying to get, say, European allies to also quit the nuclear deal with Iran.\\n\\nKENYON: Well, it has to no effect. I mean, quite the contrary, the Europeans turned around and said, no, you need to get back in it. And now it looks like Biden will get back in it. So this should be quite satisfying as a first step for the European allies. Where that goes from there, of course, will depend on Iran's reaction and what further steps are actually taken. Getting back into the deal, as it was, is one thing. And that's what Iran is saying it's willing to accept as a first step. And then it would seem new talks would be required, and then that could be a bumpy road indeed.\\n\\nKELLY: And real quick last question to each of you. How tense should we be about what might happen in these next three weeks? Asking because President Trump has been making threatening rumblings on Twitter.\\n\\nKENYON: Well, that would be the ratcheting of tensions to an extreme point if there were an attack from the U.S. at this point. And obviously, simply because the anniversary is coming, you have to be very watchful as to what Iran gets up to.\\n\\nKELLY: Greg?\\n\\nMYRE: The U.S. military has really been sending strong signals, flying B-52s and other planes into the region, sending a real signal of deterrence, warning Iran not to take any action? So anything could happen. Don't want to take anything out of the realm of possibility, but there is - been quite a bit of preparation just to guard against any type of violent action that might come in the next few weeks.\\n\\nKELLY: We have been talking with Greg Myre, who covers national security for NPR, and Peter Kenyon, who covers Iran for us. Thanks to you both.\\n\\nKENYON: Thank you.\\n\\nMYRE: Thank you, Mary Louise.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Releases Green New Deal Outline\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR\\n\\nUpdated 4:30 p.m.\\n\\nWhether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an Antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report, there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity.\\n\\nPolitics Ocasio-Cortez Talks About Ambitious Plan To Combat Climate Change Ocasio-Cortez To Unveil Ambitious Plan To Combat Climate Change Listen · 8:53 8:53\\n\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a Green New Deal — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions.\\n\\nThat's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking.\\n\\nEven the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Thursday on Morning Edition.\\n\\nShe added: It could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal.\\n\\nWhat is the Green New Deal?\\n\\nIn very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy.\\n\\nIn that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for.\\n\\nImportantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years.\\n\\nLawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating Super Bowl winners, as well as to send political messages — for example, telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies, as the Senate did in summer 2018.\\n\\nWhat are the specifics of that framework?\\n\\nThe bill calls for a 10-year national mobilizations toward accomplishing a series of goals that the resolution lays out.\\n\\n(Note: Ocasio-Cortez's office released an updated version of the bill on Thursday. The earlier version, which we had included in a prior version of this story, is still available here.)\\n\\nAmong the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.\\n\\nIn addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of FAQs provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals:\\n\\nupgrading all existing buildings in the country for energy efficiency;\\n\\nworking with farmers to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions ... as much as is technologically feasible (while supporting family farms and promoting universal access to healthy food);\\n\\nOverhauling transportation systems to reduce emissions — including expanding electric car manufacturing, building charging stations everywhere, and expanding high-speed rail to a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary;\\n\\nA guaranteed job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security for every American;\\n\\nHigh-quality health care for all Americans.\\n\\nWhich is to say: the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy.\\n\\nAre those ideas doable?\\n\\nMany in the climate science community, as well as Green New Deal proponents, agree that saving the world from disastrous effects of climate change requires aggressive action.\\n\\nAnd some of the Green New Deal's goals are indeed aggressive. For example, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral.\\n\\nAccording to Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, that may be an unreachable goal.\\n\\nWhere we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically, he said. 2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting.\\n\\nSimilarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation.\\n\\nLikewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee, for example — while popular among some Democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into.\\n\\nOn top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars.\\n\\nAltogether, the Green New Deal is a loose framework. It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies.\\n\\nRather, the idea is that Ocasio-Cortez and Markey will begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution.\\n\\nAnd again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed.\\n\\nSo did the idea of a Green New Deal start with Ocasio-Cortez?\\n\\nNot at all.\\n\\nPolitics Congressional Democrats Say Climate Change Is A Priority As They Control The House Congressional Democrats Say Climate Change Is A Priority As They Control The House Listen · 3:20 3:20\\n\\nWhile the Green New Deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive Democrats' policy conversations, the idea of a Green New Deal itself is well over a decade old. Environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003, when the term popped up in a San Francisco Chronicle article about an environmentalist conference.\\n\\nIt gained traction with a 2007 New York Times column from Thomas Friedman, where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale.\\n\\nThe phrase was also used around President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus, which had around $90 billion worth of environmental initiatives.\\n\\nWhile the idea gained some currency in Europe and also in the Green Party, it wasn't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the U.S. (Vox's Dave Roberts has a more thorough history here).\\n\\nThis latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking. While it was a product of the progressive activist community, Ocasio-Cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention.\\n\\nSo will it pass?\\n\\nThat looks unlikely.\\n\\nYes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill. However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.\\n\\nAfter the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider.\\n\\nIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, Pelosi told Politico. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\\n\\nIn addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate House Democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal.\\n\\nAmong Republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter.\\n\\nSomeone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels, said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal's text was released.\\n\\nFor his part, Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November. Information from Ocasio-Cortez's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be a tiny part of the total package of policies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.\\n\\nIf it's not going to pass and it's not even binding, why is it worth even talking about?\\n\\nIt's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats.\\n\\nAlready, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election.\\n\\nTo more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing.\\n\\nI think it's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally, said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you. And I think that a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all — these are ideas that are big enough to get people excited and show up to vote for you.\\n\\nFor her part, Ocasio-Cortez says that a policy like the Green New Deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their Congress members to support it.\\n\\nI do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. That is where the public needs to call their member of Congress and say, 'This is something that I care about,'  she told NPR, adding, Where I do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents.\\n\\nThat said, it's easy to see how a Green New Deal litmus test could backfire on that front, endangering some Democrats — particularly in swing districts.\\n\\nBut it's not just about national politics. The national-level energy for a Green New Deal could boost efforts in cities and states. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for example, has been pushing a Green New Deal in his state.\\n\\nAside from the politics, there's the fact that climate change remains an impending threat — one for which the world has yet to come up with a fix.\\n\\nIt's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! We're all going to die, said McElwee. Every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things."}
{"original": "'Expect Change': Robert Lighthizer Is Trump's Hardball-Playing China Trade Negotiator\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\\n\\nWhen U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was growing up in Ashtabula, Ohio, in the 1950s, it was a thriving port town on Lake Erie where everyone who wanted one found a job. Ships brought in iron ore destined for the steel mills of Pennsylvania, and left with coal from the mines of Appalachia.\\n\\nBut as steel and coal have declined, the Ashtabula of Lighthizer's childhood has disappeared, taking a lot of jobs with it.\\n\\nAs a doctor's son, Lighthizer grew up in relative comfort compared to a lot of other kids in Ashtabula and he would leave town to go to college.\\n\\nBut those who know him say his experience in a blue-collar town, and its long decline since then, helped shape his views on trade.\\n\\nHe grew up in a working-class town and he knows how people have suffered by losing jobs, and I suspect that that's part of why he went into that part of the legal profession, says Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers.\\n\\nNow Lighthizer is leading President Trump's negotiations with China for what is shaping up to be the final round of trade talks that could change the destinies of the world's two largest economies.\\n\\nLighthizer has spent his long career defending American manufacturers against foreign competitors and warning that trade pacts such as NAFTA would cost the U.S. jobs.\\n\\nNow, as lead negotiator in the China trade talks, the 71-year-old Lighthizer has an opportunity to do something about it.\\n\\nExpect change, expect new approaches, and expect action, he told a Center for Strategic and International Studies audience in 2017.\\n\\nA longtime Washington attorney with a deep knowledge of trade law, Lighthizer has a modest, unassuming manner that couldn't be much different from that of his boss, President Trump.\\n\\nBut if he lacks Trump's pugnacious style, Lighthizer shares most of his hardball views on trade, a fact pointed out by the president last October, when he unveiled the revised version of NAFTA known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\\n\\nBob Lighthizer is great. I've heard it for years. I said, if I ever do this, I want to get Lighthizer to represent us, 'cause he felt the way I did, Trump said.\\n\\nAs far back as 1997, Lighthizer was warning that China is not a true market economy and didn't play by the rules. If China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, he wrote, virtually no manufacturing job in this country will be safe.\\n\\nLike Trump, he has argued that tariffs and quotas are a time-tested way of protecting American jobs when foreign countries engage in unfair trading practices.\\n\\nFor most of its 157-year history, the Republican Party has been the party of building domestic industry by using trade policy to promote U.S. exports and fend off unfairly traded imports. American conservatives have had that view for even longer, Lighthizer wrote in 2011.\\n\\nUntil Trump's election, these views placed Lighthizer far outside the mainstream in Washington, where one administration after another has promoted the economic benefits of trade.\\n\\nThe view in Washington has been that opening up trade is good for the United States and good for the other countries involved. Lighthizer is a professed economic nationalist. He's very much about what's in it for the United States, says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\nLighthizer's role as a heretic in the church of free trade has earned him plenty of fans in the labor movement and among left-wing critics of trade, such as Lori Wallach, director and founder of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.\\n\\nShe first crossed paths with Lighthizer in the 1990s, during the original debate over NAFTA, which both opposed as a job-killer that would drive down U.S. wages.\\n\\nWe both were the odd fellows out, he from the right, me from the left, Wallach recalls.\\n\\nBack then, listening to each other, I suspect we both had the same reaction, which was: 'That's kind of scary! That right-wing, Reagan-administration Republican trade guy, is saying things that I 70-percent agree with!' And I have a feeling he thought, 'Wait a minute! That Ralph Nader, Public Citizen, tree-hugging consumer group lady is saying things that I 70-percent agree with!' \\n\\nBut even those who don't share Lighthizer's views on trade express a grudging respect for him.\\n\\nHe's bright, he's experienced, he's confident. He certainly understands these issues backwards and forwards, says former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who negotiated NAFTA under the Clinton administration and says he disagrees with many of Lighthizer's views.\\n\\nAs an attorney in Washington, Lighthizer worked for the steel industry, handling dumping cases against foreign competitors.\\n\\nHe also served briefly in the Reagan administration, working on a successful effort to force Japan to limit its exports to the U.S.\\n\\nI think the Japan experience told him the only way you make progress is through threats that you're prepared to carry out to restrict access to the world's largest market, which is the United States, says Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is now trying to apply the same strategy to China, betting that it can pressure Beijing to address longstanding complaints about practices such as intellectual property theft.\\n\\nLighthizer has his work cut out for him, Alden notes. After all, China has a long history of resisting pressure to reform its economy.\\n\\nThe problem is that what Lighthizer is asking the Chinese to do is quite radical, to significantly reduce the role of the Chinese state and hence the Communist Party in directing Chinese economic development. And it's not at all clear that the Chinese leadership is prepared to do that, Alden says.\\n\\nHe also worries that Trump, in his eagerness to reach a deal with Beijing, could impede the negotiations Lighthizer is heading.\\n\\nTrump pretty much left the details of last year's NAFTA talks up to Lighthizer. The president has taken a more direct role in the negotiations with Beijing.\\n\\n[Trump] continues to tweet about how much progress is being made, that a good deal is likely, that a big deal is likely. He's got this great friendship with President Xi. He's personally going to bring home the deal, Alden says.\\n\\nRecently, Trump has hinted he may extend the March 1 deadline for completing the talks, which can only reduce Lighthizer's leverage over Beijing, Alden says.\\n\\nLighthizer has a last, best chance to change a global trading system that has cost towns like Ashtabula jobs. The risk now is that the man who appointed him could undercut his efforts."}
{"original": "Despite Claims To Contrary, Trump Has Signed No Major Laws 5 Months In\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated 12:30 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump kept one of his campaign promises, signing a bill Friday to make it easier for the secretary of veterans affairs to fire and discipline employees. It came in response to the 2014 VA scandal in which employees covered up long wait times while collecting bonuses.\\n\\nThe bill, which passed earlier this month with strong bipartisan support, also gives the secretary authority to revoke bonuses and protects whistleblowers who report wrongdoing.\\n\\nWhat happened was a national disgrace and yet some of the employees involved in these scandals remained on the payrolls, Trump said just before signing the bill. Outdated laws kept the government from holding those who failed our veterans accountable. Today we are finally changing those laws.\\n\\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 marks Trump's 40th law signed.\\n\\nSounds like a lot.\\n\\nAnd in recent days, Trump has boasted about all the legislation he has signed.\\n\\nWe passed and signed 38 pieces of legislation, which nobody likes to talk about, Trump said June 13 before a lunch with lawmakers. I think probably seldom has any president and administration done more or had more success so early on, including a record number of resolutions to eliminate job-killing regulations.\\n\\nAnd he tweeted the same message on Friday morning.\\n\\nA White House spokesperson confirmed to NPR that at the time of Trump's tweet, the number was actually 39 — not 38.\\n\\nMeasuring laws passed by counting rather than by significance is pretty meaningless. More on that in a bit. Among modern Oval Office occupants, Presidents Jimmy Carter (52), George H.W. Bush (41) and Bill Clinton (41) had all signed more bills into law than Trump has by this point in their presidencies.\\n\\nSo, what has Trump accomplished with Congress so far? Nothing that political scientists would categorize as major pieces of legislation. We looked at this question as Trump hit his 100 days mark. This story contains more detail on legislation he signed in the early part of his presidency.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nAs he said, Trump has signed a record number of resolutions reversing Obama-era regulations, 15 in total. These resolutions were passed under the Congressional Review Act and only required a simple majority for passage in the Senate. It was only used once before, by George W. Bush.\\n\\nThat made it much easier to get them through than regular legislation. The Congressional Review Act was passed in 1996 and allows Congress to reverse rules within 60 legislative days of their submission. That period is now over, so you won't see more laws like these any time soon.\\n\\nTwo of the laws he has signed are budget related. One simply extended federal spending for a week while Congress worked out its differences on a longer-term funding bill. The other was possibly the most significant legislation signed by Trump so far. It kept the government funded and set spending levels through the end of September.\\n\\nBut these sorts of spending bills are also the most basic functions of Congress and the president, literally keeping the lights on.\\n\\nOn June 6, Trump signed a law designating the courthouse on Church Street in Nashville, Tenn., as the Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Thompson served in the Senate, representing Tennessee from 1994 to 2003 and briefly ran for president in 2008. But he is best known for playing District Attorney Arthur Branch on the long-running police procedural drama Law and Order on NBC. He died in 2015. There was no formal signing ceremony for that bill.\\n\\nOn May 16, the president signed a law requiring the government to allow federal employees to use Uber, Lyft, bike sharing and other forms of alternative transportation for official travel.

{"original": "Coronary Stent Procedures Very Common\\n\\nThe procedure that opened a clogged artery in former President Bill Clinton is called stenting. Clinton had two stents placed inside the artery as part of a procedure that is common for people with heart disease. As many as a million Americans a year have the stent procedure done.\\n\\nRENEE MONTAGNE, host:\\n\\nAs weve just heard, the procedure Bill Clinton had is called stenting. Its pretty common. As many as a million Americans a year have it done.\\n\\nNPRs Joanne Silberner covered former vice president Dick Cheneys health. Cheney also had a stent put in. And what, exactly, is a stent, and how does it end up in your heart?\\n\\nJOANNE SILBERNER: Well, picture a tiny tube. Its very small. It's small enough to fit inside a blood vessel. Its steel mesh and its put at the end of a catheter, something - they can actually push this tube up and around. It goes up, usually through your groin. They feed it through blood vessels. It gets to your heart blood vessel, the one thats blocked. There is, actually, also a little, tiny balloon inside this little, tiny, steel mesh stent. The balloon is inflated. That pushes the stent up so that its holding that artery open, so that the blood flow can go through. And that prevents a heart attack from developing.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: And why would the doctors have put a stent - well, actually, it turns out to be two stents - into Clintons heart?\\n\\nSILBERNER: Well, his office says, you know, he was feeling some pain. They refer to it as discomfort. That means that one of those clogged arteries was actually starting to shut down a little bit, and that can cause you pain because the blood flow gets limited. And when you put it in, you hold that blood vessel open - and things go better.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: But Clinton had that quadruple bypass back in 2004. So why would he need a stent after a bypass?\\n\\nSILBERNER: Because he has an ongoing condition. Its called atherosclerosis. And his arteries tend to clog. A lot of people have this, around the country. There may be a million of these procedures done a year. This will be ongoing. Those blockages will keep on occurring. Youve got to figure out ways to open them up a little bit, and stents are actually a pretty good way of doing it.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: So as we just heard in Roberts story, former President Clinton has changed his lifestyle. He eats better now, he exercises. What does that mean for his future?\\n\\nSILBERNER: Well, he has an ongoing condition, atherosclerosis, clogging of the arteries. It will go on. He may have more stents. He is going to be on anticoagulant drugs because what happens with these little mesh devices, you know, when they are in the heart like that is, blood clots can form around them. So you need to be on anticoagulants after a procedure like this. But really, you know, as long as he gets regular medical care, which he is clearly doing, you know, things should go pretty well. Cardiologists have gotten very good at dealing with this as long as, you know, you go in, you get it looked at before they turn into bigger problems.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: NPRs health policy correspondent Joanne Silberner.\\n\\nCopyright © 2010 NPR.

{"original": "Tillerson Confirms North Korea Missile An ICBM, Calls For Global Action\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 7:19 p.m. ET\\n\\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed Tuesday that the missile launched by North Korea on Monday was an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a statement in which he condemned the test.\\n\\nTesting an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world, Tillerson said.\\n\\nIn response to the test, U.S. and South Korean forces conducted joint military exercises aimed at countering North Korea's destabilizing and unlawful actions on July 4, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Army.\\n\\nThe exercise, off the east coast of South Korea, deployed rockets from both the U.S. and South Korean missile arsenals, the statement said.\\n\\nIt added: The U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK (Republic of Korea) in the face of threats is ironclad.\\n\\nIn an earlier joint statement, China and Russia called the test unacceptable and called for a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests by North Korea — and a suspension of large-scale military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea. The Associated Press has more:\\n\\nThe foreign ministries said that as a 'voluntary political decision,' North Korea should declare a 'moratorium on testing nuclear devices and test launches of ballistic missiles.' In turn, the U.S. and South Korea should 'accordingly refrain from large-scale joint maneuvers,' the joint statement added. They said 'the confronting parties' involved should sit down for talks to agree on principles that include a refusal to use force and a pledge to make the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nOur previous post continues below:\\n\\nNorth Korea says it has successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, which in theory, can fly far enough to reach Alaska.\\n\\nNorth Korean state TV broke in with the announcement with a triumphant anchor declaring, Our intercontinental ballistic rocket can reach anywhere in this world, and we can end America's nuclear threat and bring peace to the Korean peninsula.\\n\\nIf confirmed, this would mark the first successful test of a North Korean missile capable of reaching the United States — a longstanding goal for Pyongyang. It's not clear whether North Korea would have the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the missile, a separate technical challenge.\\n\\nIn its initial analysis, the U.S. Pacific Command said it had detected and tracked the launch of an intermediate-range missile, which would have a much shorter range than what North Korea is claiming.\\n\\nSouth Korea's and Japan's militaries analyzed the flight and say the missile flew nearly 600 miles, reaching an altitude of 1,500 miles — higher than many satellites in orbit — before turning to come back down. It flew for an estimated 40 minutes before landing in the Sea of Japan and within Japan's exclusive economic zone.\\n\\nIf the missile were traveling forward instead of upward, in a flatter trajectory, it's estimated it would have a range that could put Alaska at risk.\\n\\nThe missile flight is the 12th North Korean provocation of the year, breaking United Nations resolutions barring such tests.\\n\\nIt is a serious threat to Japan's security and cannot be tolerated, Japan's Defense Ministry said.\\n\\nThe move by Pyongyang comes following a White House summit between President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which the two countries pledged to coordinate on North Korea policy and continue a security alliance that has lasted more than 60 years.\\n\\nMoon assembled the country's national security team for an emergency meeting.\\n\\nTrump responded to the test in tweets. Earlier he had indicated the reliance on China to help curb Pyongyang hasn't worked out, and in two successive tweets following the morning missile launch, Trump seemed to poke fun at the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. The tweets read:\\n\\nNorth Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea.....and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\\n\\nChina, for its part, says it has already increased the presence of security agents on its border with North Korea, signed on to U.N. sanctions packages and more strongly enforced sanctions that bar imports of North Korean coal into China. Coal accounts for an estimated 30 percent of North Korea's exports.\\n\\nThe missile flight could represent a significant technological and political accomplishment for North Korea. If Pyongyang has an ICBM, Japan, South Korea and the United States are in a much tougher negotiating position.\\n\\nSome analysts say it may no longer be realistic to pursue the longstanding U.S. goal of denuclearizing North Korea, and that instead the focus should be on a freeze to keep Pyongyang's capabilities from advancing.\\n\\nMelissa Hanham — a researcher with the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies — says it's time for efforts to engage North Korea at a diplomatic level.\\n\\nWe need to have really serious conversations amongst ourselves and with allies about what we're willing to trade, she says, because so far there has been no price that was worth paying to stop their program.\\n\\nJihye Lee and Camila Domonoske contributed to this post."}
{"original": "Houston Police To Cease 'No Knock' Warrants, Chief Announces After Deadly Raid\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n\\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo says his department will stop serving no knock search warrants, weeks after a raid on a house left two married suspects dead and five officers injured. Acevedo also reiterated that the officer who led that raid may face criminal charges.\\n\\nThe no-knock warrant's going to go away, kind of like leaded gasoline in our city, Acevedo said. He added that raids that stem from those warrants would only be used in very limited cases — and that they would not be used to nab people suspected of dealing small amounts of drugs.\\n\\nYou're going to see those going away, he said.\\n\\nAcevedo announced the policy shift Monday night during a town hall meeting hosted by the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice. The event gathered criminal justice officials and politicians with local activists and members of the public — who vented their anger over the deadly raid and what they called the police's overreliance on informants and searches rather than investigation.\\n\\nThe chief gave few new details about suspicions the lead officer in the raid may have lied about getting a tip about the target house from a confidential informant. Acevedo said the officer is still getting paid as the investigation proceeds, saying the arrangement is required legally but goes against his own opinion.\\n\\nI'm very confident that we're going to have criminal charges on one or more police officers, Acevedo said Monday.\\n\\nBut as the chief spoke those words, he was interrupted by shouts from the crowd, as people yelled, All of them.\\n\\nAcevedo replied that charges will be filed against whoever is appropriate.\\n\\nDennis Tuttle, 59, and Rhogena Nicholas, 58, died in the Jan. 28 raid, which had been planned after an informant purportedly told police the couple's house was used for heroin dealing.\\n\\nNo heroin was found at the residence, and Acevedo and the Houston police were forced to backtrack after initially saying the two suspects had opened fire on officers as soon as they reached the door of the house in the Pecan Park neighborhood, south of downtown Houston. The official narrative changed after it emerged that the police seemed to have opened fire first — shooting the couple's dog.\\n\\nHere's how member station Houston Public Media describes the revised account of the incident:\\n\\nThe shootout occurred when a group of officers were serving a 'no-knock' search warrant to seize heroin at 7815 Harding Street. According to a timeline, a pitbull dog attacked them upon entering the house and an officer shot and killed the dog. Subsequently, a male suspect came from the back of the house and opened fire. An officer was hit on one of his shoulders and fell on a sofa in the living room. At that time, a female suspect went towards the fallen officer reaching over him and tried to get his gun and that's when back-up officers shot the female suspect, after which an exchange of gunfire continued. The suspects, a married couple, died in the shootout.\\n\\nAs The Houston Chronicle has reported, police found relatively small amounts of marijuana and cocaine at the house, which also contained several guns.\\n\\nWith the legality of the operation now in doubt, Acevedo said his department is required to review other cases that involved the same officers who carried out the raid.\\n\\nAcevedo did not mention the names of the officers who are being considered for criminal charges. But he later mentioned corrupt police work, if you ask me — when you lie on an affidavit to a court, that's a crime.\\n\\nThere is no excuse, he said.\\n\\nThe conversation at Monday night's town hall grew testy at times, with members of the crowd sometimes shouting accusations against the chief and his department.\\n\\nSeeking to dispel calls for his department to turn the investigation over to an outside agency, Acevedo said, About three weeks ago, when this incident happened, we were describing our officer — now an officer who's being criminally investigated — as basically a hero.\\n\\nBut that changed after Houston police uncovered what it believes to be criminal misconduct by one or more of its own officers, the chief added. The Chronicle and other media outlets have identified him as Officer Gerald Goines, a 30-year police veteran.\\n\\nThe attorney for Goines, who was shot in the neck and face, said on Tuesday that the officer is innocent; as local TV news KPRC reports, she also said the case is at risk of being distorted by public and political pressures.\\n\\nWhen Acevedo was asked Monday night whether he would agree to the FBI or the Texas Rangers taking over the investigation, he replied, No.\\n\\nThe FBI is already involved in the case, he said, adding, We're uncovering our crimes and we're not worried about missing anything in the inquiry.\\n\\nAcknowledging the anger and skepticism in the room, the chief said, I promise you all, if you'll have the patience, you are going to see good come out at the end of the police investigation into the case and a review of its policies.\\n\\nThe deadly raid was not captured by body cameras; in the coming weeks, Acevedo said, his officers will begin the practice of wearing them during warrant-based entries to houses and other buildings."}
{"original": "Half Of Professors In NPR Ed Survey Have Used 'Trigger Warnings'\\n\\nEnlarge this image Keith Negley for NPR Keith Negley for NPR\\n\\nThis school year, the University of Chicago has put the debate over trigger warnings on campus back in the news. The University told incoming freshmen that, because of its commitment to freedom of expression, it does not support warnings to students about potentially difficult material.\\n\\nBut amid all the attention to trigger warnings, there have been very few facts about exactly how common they are and how they're used.\\n\\nNPR Ed sent out a survey last fall to faculty members at colleges and universities around the country. We focused specifically on the types of institutions most students attend — not the elite private universities most often linked to the trigger warning idea.\\n\\nWe received more than 800 responses, and this month as the issue once again made headlines we followed up with some of those professors.\\n\\nHere are some of our key findings:\\n\\nAbout half of professors said they've used a trigger warning in advance of introducing potentially difficult material.\\n\\nMost said they did so of their own volition, not because of a student's request or an administrative policy.\\n\\nThis was not a scientific sample, but it's one of the larger and more representative polls to be published on the topic to date.\\n\\nOur sample included 829 instructors of undergraduates. Just over half of our respondents, 53.9 percent, said they teach at public four-year institutions and 27 percent said they were at two-year institutions.\\n\\nThese instructors were overwhelmingly familiar with trigger warnings: 86 percent knew the term and 56 percent said they had heard of colleagues who had used them.\\n\\nBut only 1.8 percent said, as of last fall, that their institutions had any official policies about their use.\\n\\nLet's define terms.\\n\\nThe term trigger in this sense originates in psychology, where it pertains to people with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. For survivors of combat violence, sexual abuse or other trauma, certain sights, sounds, smells or other reminders can bring on intense emotional and even physical reactions, like a full-blown panic attack.\\n\\nIn the media and elsewhere online, language similar to trigger warnings is often used more broadly to label material that concerns sexual abuse or sexual assault, that is potentially racially or politically offensive, or graphically violent or sexual. For example, when NPR covered the fatal shooting by police of Philando Castile, an African-American resident of the Minneapolis area, we included these words: We'll embed the video here, with the warning that it contains images and language that viewers might find disturbing.\\n\\nBut the rules are different in a college classroom than in a therapeutic setting, and both are different than when addressing a general audience. Even some of our respondents who had supplied a form of trigger warning as a courtesy or heads-up said they didn't intend to give students a free pass to avoid uncomfortable topics.\\n\\nIn fact, the picture that emerges is of professors making private decisions within the four walls of the classroom. Only 3.4 percent said students had requested such a warning. Most instructors who told us they'd used trigger warnings — 64.7 percent — did so because, they said, I thought the material needed one.\\n\\nSo what are the types of material that are most likely to trigger a trigger warning?\\n\\nOur respondents were most likely to say they had used trigger warnings in reference to sexual or violent material. Racially, politically, or religiously charged topics were mentioned less often.\\n\\nI have had students break down reading novels depicting sexual assault and incest in my gender studies courses, a professor at the University of North Carolina said in a survey response.\\n\\nJoanna Hunter, who teaches sociology at Radford University in Virginia, told NPR Ed last week that she has given a warning before explaining the practice of female genital mutilation, within the broader context of a discussion of cultural relativism.\\n\\nLauren Griffith, a professor of ethnology at Texas Tech University, said that she gave warnings when teaching Native American students whose religious beliefs required that they undergo a form of ritual purification upon viewing images of death. However, she says, outside of such specific situations, she doesn't believe that trigger warnings best serve the cause of liberal education: I think that trigger warnings can and should be used in a limited number of situations, but overusing them can create a situation in which students opt out of learning experiences simply because they don't want to confront their own assumptions about the world.\\n\\nHasan Jeffries, an associate professor of history at Ohio State University, said in an interview that heavy emotions — even tears — are parts of the learning process that he welcomes. He teaches African-American and U.S. history.\\n\\nHe tells his students at the beginning of each course, This is hard history. It's hard to talk about, hard to absorb. It's filled with trauma, sexual violence, racial violence, visual images of murder and chaos. You may walk into my classroom and see an image of a lynching that was put on a postcard. This is America.\\n\\nAt the same time, he adds, he's sensitive to the fact that many of his students may have experienced, say, sexual assault or police violence in their personal lives.\\n\\nI understand and take seriously trauma triggers, Jeffries says. I'm not hostile to one side or the other and I don't think there's an absolute position.\\n\\nNone of the professors we talked to said that they had had a student try to get out of an assignment or skip a class because of topics that made them uncomfortable. The most common response to a warning was either nothing at all, or at most, for a student to excuse him or herself from class for a few minutes.\\n\\nJeffries, like other faculty members, told us that his department had ultimately decided against issuing an official position on the use of trigger warnings: The general consensus was, we're not really interested in putting those forward. We feel confident in ourselves as teachers and in the maturity of our students.\\n\\nMeg Anderson contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The Border Wall Isn't The Only Reason Democrats Oppose Plan To End The Shutdown\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gregory Bull/AP Gregory Bull/AP\\n\\nDemocrats and immigrant rights groups were quick to oppose President Trump's proposal to end the government shutdown over the weekend because it includes $5.7 billion for an expanded border wall.\\n\\nNow that they've seen the full language of the bill, they've found other reasons not to like it.\\n\\nThe proposed bill includes some big changes to U.S. immigration policy that were not included in the president's public announcement, such as a provision that would sharply limit asylum applications for children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\\n\\nIt's a Trojan horse filled with many extreme immigration proposals, said Kerri Talbot of the Immigration Hub, an immigrants' rights organization, during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. The bill includes the most extreme proposals on asylum I think that I've ever seen, Talbot said.\\n\\nThis historic change in asylum law would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum.\\n\\nWhen he announced his proposal on Saturday, Trump said it includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse, including a new system that would allow Central America minors to apply for asylum in their home countries.\\n\\nBut the president did not mention that the proposal would in fact require migrant children to apply from their home countries and prevent them from applying in person at the border. In addition, only migrant children with a qualified parent in the U.S. would be permitted to apply for asylum — a sharp break from current policy.\\n\\nThis historic change in asylum law would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum, said Greg Chen, government relations director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\\n\\nWhen Trump announced the proposal over the weekend, he said the bill would provide three years of legislative relief for recipients of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA protects about 700,000 young immigrants, including DREAMERs, who were brought to the country illegally as children, from deportation. He also said the bill would extend protections for 300,000 holders of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.\\n\\nProtections offered to immigrants under both DACA and TPS have been targeted to end under the Trump administration, though federal courts have stepped in to extend both programs for now.\\n\\nBut on closer inspection, immigration experts say, the Senate GOP bill would likely cover fewer immigrants than are currently protected under DACA and TPS.\\n\\nThe administration's proposal would tighten DACA requirements in a number of ways and raise fees for the program. The proposal does not extend DACA, wrote David Bier, an immigration analyst at the Cato Institute, so much as replace it with a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.\\n\\nLikewise, the bill would create a new application process for TPS holders, advocates say, with new standards and higher fees that would exclude many current TPS holders. And while the bill would allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Haiti to apply, it would exclude those from countries such as Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.\\n\\nOn the Senate floor Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the proposal as a bold, comprehensive compromise to reopen the federal government. McConnell criticized Democrats for rejecting the proposal and promised a vote in the Senate later this week.\\n\\nBut Democrats say there's nothing bipartisan about the bill, which was negotiated without their input.\\n\\nThe president's proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith, said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer during remarks on the Senate floor.\\n\\nThe asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one, Schumer said."}
{"original": "Growing Marijuana Industry Struggles To Attract Employees Of Color\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron Schachter/WGBH Aaron Schachter/WGBH\\n\\nAs marijuana becomes legal around the country, blacks and Latinos are often left out of new business opportunities. Advocates say people of color are often reluctant to join the growing legal marijuana economy because they were targeted far more often than whites during the war on drugs. Studies show members of such communities were arrested and jailed for illegal marijuana use far more often than whites.\\n\\nAs Massachusetts developed laws for legal marijuana, officials wrote what they claimed was a first-in-the-nation Social Equity Program explicitly to give members of those communities a leg up.\\n\\nBut this part of the state law isn't working — next to no black or Latino candidates have applied for licenses in Massachusetts.\\n\\nThey're scared of the government.\\n\\nThey're scared of the government, man, said Sieh Samura, an outspoken cannabis activist. This is still a new thing. And there's taxes, there's the government, there's all kinds of things, you know. Just because people say it's legal ... it's not welcoming for everybody.\\n\\nStudies show that blacks and Latinos nationwide have been arrested and incarcerated for cannabis and other drug crimes at at least four times the rate of whites. The long-term effects of the war on drugs launched in the 1970s are still evident in many communities of color.\\n\\nSo, the city of Somerville, Mass., passed an ordinance requiring that 50 percent of recreational marijuana licenses go to black and Latino applicants.\\n\\nWe want to make sure that everyone has a real authentic opportunity to participate in that economy in the future, said Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone. If not, we start to lose the fabric and soul of our community. And then social inequity becomes greater, becomes vaster, and we can't allow that to happen. We're a pro-growth community, but we want to make sure regular folks are able to participate in that.\\n\\nSamura, an Iraq War veteran, said medical marijuana was a big help for him dealing with the effects of PTSD. As a black man, he sees himself as a marijuana pioneer from a community that has long been targeted. He says this fraught relationship between law enforcement and communities of color is why many black and Latino entrepreneurs are reluctant to start recreational marijuana businesses.\\n\\nTo be a model for others, Samura and his wife Leah created a recreational marijuana business called 612 Studios. For months they've been coming to a massive marijuana cultivation facility in Milford, Mass., to participate in The Sira Accelerator, a 12-week program designed to get more people of color into the industry by doing everything from raising money, to helping with marketing, packaging and distribution.\\n\\nThis program is run by Sira Naturals, which grows marijuana and creates products for its own medical dispensaries and some other recreational businesses. Mike Dundas, Sira Naturals' CEO, said the company wants to help longtime marijuana advocates, like the Samuras, or folks who have been dabbling in the illegal pot market.\\n\\nWe see our program, the Sira Accelerator, as sort of offering a hand to those who've been operating — and have skill and passion and dedication to cannabis products — in the illicit marketplace, to come to the regulated side, to get on the books and help facilitate the start of their businesses, said Dundas.\\n\\nIn return for the advice and counsel, Sira takes just under a 1o percent stake in the new company.\\n\\nSira also hopes the accelerator will help it open a recreational shop in Somerville, where it already runs one of three medical dispensaries. The company can't get a recreational license until black or Latino entrepreneurs do because of the city's ordinance. Dundas, who is white, admits he's scrambling to find and mentor people of color who want to open businesses in Somerville to ensure that his company can open a retail shop of its own.\\n\\nKaren O'Keefe, director of state policies with the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, said there have been lots of attempts around the country to help candidates from black and Latino communities, but none have worked.\\n\\nNone of the states have the kind of diversity that we would like to see in the cannabis industry, she said.\\n\\nSome marijuana business owners have expressed frustration that states are picking winners and losers in the marijuana industry. But O'Keefe argued that this industry is different, given the ill effects of the war on drugs.

Obama also cited an unacceptable level of harassment of American diplomats by Russian security services and police in Moscow.\\n\\nThe immediate impact of the president's executive order is that 35 Russian diplomats will be expelled from the U.S. and two Russian compounds will be closed.\\n\\nThe statement also names Russian individuals and entities — including two intelligence services — to be targeted by new sanctions.\\n\\nWe will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized, the statement goes on to say.\\n\\nLater on Thursday, a separate joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FBI reiterated the claim that the Russian government was behind the cyber attacks:\\n\\nThis activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing, campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information from these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen information. In other countries, Russian intelligence services have also undertaken damaging and disruptive cyber-attacks, including on critical infrastructure, in some cases masquerading as third parties or hiding behind false online personas designed to cause victim to misattribute the source of the attack.\\n\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on assertions that Russia was responsible for hacks and leaks during the election. But shortly after 6:00 pm on Thursday, his transition team released the following statement, attributed to Trump:\\n\\nIt's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\\n\\nCongressional leaders from both parties have released statements supporting the new sanctions, while taking thinly-veiled shots at political opponents.\\n\\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan sent out a short release to reporters this afternoon:\\n\\nRussia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.\\n\\nDemocratic Senator Charles Schumer, who is expected to lead his caucus in the Senate come January, welcomed the administration's actions.\\n\\nI strongly support the steps the administration is taking to fight back against Russia's interference in our election. We need to punch back against Russia, and punch back hard. I hope the incoming Trump administration, which has been far too close to Russia throughout the campaign and transition, won't think for one second about weakening these new sanctions or our existing regime. Both parties ought to be united in standing up to Russian interference in our elections, to their cyberattacks, their illegal annexation of Crimea and other extra-legal interventions.\\n\\nThe Democratic National Committee, which was targeted by the alleged attacks, also weighed in, urging further action.\\n\\nWe applaud President Obama for taking these actions in response to the Russian government-sponsored cyberattacks on the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and our free and fair elections. However, more must be done. It has been widely reported that U.S. intelligence officials have a 'high level of confidence' that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in these attacks, even providing direction on how the stolen material was leaked. These intrusions were not just 'hacks.' They were attacks on the United States by a foreign power and should be treated as such. Therefore, today's action alone by the White House is insufficient. Now it's time for President-elect Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress to put our national security before politics and show the American people that they are serious about protecting our democracy. That's why I have called on Congress to launch a thorough, independent, and bipartisan investigation on the Russian government's unprecedented interference in the 2016 election.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the AP Reports that Russia is already considering retaliatory measures to the sanctions. And a tweet from Russia's embassy in the U.K. mocked President Obama, tweeting a picture of a lame duck.\\n\\nRussia has denied that it carried out cyber attacks meant to influence the U.S. election."}
{"original": "Trump Tax Proposals Are Terrific, Adviser Arthur Laffer Says\\n\\nSteve Inskeep talks to Arthur Laffer, tax policy adviser to Donald Trump and a leading advocate of supply side economics — the idea that cutting taxes increases government revenue by spurring growth.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nAnd now let's ask about President-elect Trump's tax plan. He campaigned on a promise of big tax cuts. And his advisers on tax policy include Arthur Laffer. That's a familiar name to people who've followed politics for a long time because Laffer's work once influenced President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, big tax cuts in the '80s, which reshaped the economy and also increased deficits. We reached Arthur Laffer at his home in Nashville, Tenn.\\n\\nWhen you look at Trump's tax proposals, how closely do they match your ideas of what a tax plan should be?\\n\\nARTHUR LAFFER: I think they are terrific. I think the corporate tax in the U.S. today is not only global in scope, which is a mistake - we have the single highest tax rate in the OECD - and it's discouraging businesses, jobs, output, employment coming to the U.S. It's driving business away through inversions and through formation of companies elsewhere. Dropping that tax rate to 15 percent would have a huge impact on the U.S. economy and would have very little impact, if any, on tax revenues from corporations, from businesses.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So you're making the argument that a tax cut, because it might stimulate economic activity, would actually lead to more government revenue.\\n\\nLAFFER: In this case, yes, I do believe so. And if we lower that tax rate, I think we will have no more inversions, No. 1.\\n\\nINSKEEP: We should remind people, when you say inversions, you're talking about a company moving its corporate headquarters to Ireland or wherever so that they...\\n\\nLAFFER: Yes, thank you. That's exactly what I'm talking about. And No. 2, I think a lot of companies, both U.S. and foreign, will decide to locate their facilities here in the U.S. rather than abroad.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So let me ask you about deficits as part of this picture because when we look at the total Trump tax plan, anybody who's scored this has found that it adds trillions to the federal deficit and to the federal debt over time. How big a disadvantage is that in your view?\\n\\nLAFFER: You know, when you look at Donald Trump's proposals today, what I would do is I would take those proposals - I would take them seriously but not literally. Now, the one I would take literally is the corporate tax, which we talked about. But the ones I would take seriously are reforming the tax codes. If you go to the Brady proposal or the Paul Ryan proposals - now remember, all tax plans have to come out of Ways and Means.\\n\\nINSKEEP: The House tax writing committee, right.\\n\\nLAFFER: Yeah, that's how. And if you look at their proposals if combined with Trump's vision of the world - not literal proposal - I don't think you're going to have any huge increase in deficits on a static basis.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So one more thing here - Steven Mnuchin, the designate to be treasury secretary...\\n\\nLAFFER: Yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...Puts a different cast on all of this because he is saying, recently, that any reductions we have an upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class, people on the top. He says we'll be paying about the same. Are you comfortable with that?\\n\\nLAFFER: Well, yeah. That's what we were talking about earlier. And what I'd like to do is see us get rid of all these deductions, exemptions, exclusions and loopholes and lower the rate dramatically. And you'd create enormous growth in the United States. That's exactly what we need.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is there a risk when you start lowering tax rates and hoping you will also eliminate deductions that the deductions get defended - they don't actually go away, and you just end up cutting rates and increasing deficits?\\n\\nLAFFER: There's a risk in all policy going forward. But when you look at tax policy, what you really want to do is try to get bipartisan support, like we had under Reagan, with both our sets of tax bills.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, that raises one more thing. Republicans in Congress have been openly saying, we want to get rid of Obamacare. We want to replace it with something else, but whatever we do ought to be bipartisan. If it's just one party, it's not sustainable. It doesn't work...\\n\\nLAFFER: That's right. That's why it should be, yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Would you say the same thing is true of changing tax policy - if it's not bipartisan...\\n\\nLAFFER: Yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...Just don't do it?\\n\\nLAFFER: Why, you know, you want to make it bipartisan. And you try to convince the others of your logic, and they try to convince you. And hopefully, you can make some ground. Now, I've done some stuff with Al Gore historically. And I'm all for a carbon tax if you were willing to offset it with a 100-percent static (unintelligible), income tax or payroll tax. So is Al. I mean, that's the type of bipartisan stuff I think we should be able to do. But this is...\\n\\nINSKEEP: We better explain what you just said because you're saying that you would favor a carbon tax, which is a way to fight climate change, just so long as it's revenue-neutral. Some other tax should go down.\\n\\nLAFFER: Yeah, an income tax or payroll tax, which is what Al Gore has always suggested whenever he's talked about a carbon tax. I think he's brilliant on this issue. The fear I have with a carbon tax is that if it's a standalone, it'll kill the economy. This is what Congress should be doing - is trying to find common ground. I mean, I think bipartisanship is very important.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Do you think the Republicans in Congress and this president-elect would go along with that, or they would say, actually, that's not very important - we don't even believe it?\\n\\nLAFFER: I don't know. I mean - but I do know I was called by a group of Democrats who are about 50-some members of the House - all Democrats - would love to do something with Trump on the tax codes and reforming them and making them pro-growth as long as they can put in some things like the carbon tax substitution. We need to get together where we have a growth agenda. And I think Trump is very willing to work on a bipartisan basis to get a good growth agenda. And I - and I laud him for all those efforts.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Arthur Laffer, it's been a pleasure. Thanks very much.\\n\\nLAFFER: My pleasure. Thank you.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Arthur Laffer is an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Voice of America CEO Accused Of Fraud, Misuse Of Office All In One Week\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Agency for Global Media U.S. Agency for Global Media\\n\\nUpdated at 7:35 p.m. ET\\n\\nFresh crises and fresh challenges confront the Trump-appointed CEO of the parent of Voice of America, even with less than two weeks left of the Trump presidency.\\n\\nTo start, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia this week accused U.S. Agency for Global Media CEO Michael Pack of illegally funneling more than $4 million to his private documentary company through a not-for-profit that he also controls.\\n\\nThen, five recent chiefs of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty - appointed under Democratic and Republican administrations - jointly warned President-elect Joe Biden that Pack poses a long-term threat to the credibility and professionalism of the five networks he oversees.\\n\\nAnd now Pack is now being accused of trying to propagandize the Voice of America by a group of whistleblowers. They take exception to a planned appearance by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at VOA's Washington headquarters on Monday, just nine days before the Biden administration begins.\\n\\nPompeo will soon be out of his job. And it's expected Pack will be replaced promptly as well. But he has sought to outlast his time in office by burrowing himself and conservative allies into boards that will steer Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The not-for-profit broadcasters are all funded by the federal government through USAGM.\\n\\nThose networks, along with VOA and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, collectively reach more than 350 million people across the world each week. They historically have demonstrated American pluralism by providing balanced coverage of news events and robust political debate, regardless of how it reflects on current government officials. The broadcasters are also intended to serve the citizens of nations which do not allow journalists to operate freely.\\n\\nThrough an associate, Pack declined earlier this week to comment on the suit filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine. The associate said Friday that Pack was not available to comment on the other developments.\\n\\nPack has thrust his agency on a path of tumult, pursuing an agenda that appears to prize loyalty to President Trump and his policies over the values that, by law, the federal broadcasters are supposed to espouse.\\n\\nAlready, two judges have ruled that Pack acted illegally in office. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which investigates federal whistleblowers' complaints, concluded that he probably did so in a separate instance. Pack has instigated investigations of journalists for purported anti-Trump bias; withheld visa extension for journalists who are foreign citizens, requiring their return to their home countries; and sought to erase regulations that insulate his newsrooms from political interference.\\n\\nIn interviews with multiple conservative outlets, Pack has relied upon Trumpian rhetoric to say he intended to drain the swamp at networks he says are staffed by journalists seeking to sabotage the president. He also sought to fire executives at USAGM, alleging they had been so lax on security measures that the networks would be ripe for espionage.\\n\\nWarnings about Pompeo appearance at VOA\\n\\nPompeo has been one of President Trump's most loyal allies, and he has remained silent as other Cabinet members, national security advisers and press aides have resigned their position, denouncing the president's role in inciting followers who stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday.\\n\\nSimilarly, Pack has not addressed those concerns, either publicly or internally to his own staff. Six USAGM and VOA staffers raised concerns about the appropriateness of Pompeo's visit so close to the end of his term. Initially, new VOA director Robert R. Reilly said it would also run on whatever VOA broadcast services were live at the time of his speech. Journalists at VOA pushed back; it was not clear whether the Pompeo speech would ultimately run on its networks at all or would be streamed on its digital site.\\n\\nJournalists also pointed to the nature of the event — in person and indoors — as a possible health risk, even with limited seating. It is not the first time such questions have been raised. Pompeo held large indoor holiday parties last month despite warnings from public health officials. The Voice of America scrupulously adheres to all CDC COVID-19 guidelines, a VOA spokeswoman said in a statement.\\n\\nOn Friday, a group of anonymous USAGM and VOA whistleblowers represented by the private Government Accountability Project filed a formal complaint to Pack, Reilly, Congress. the U.S. State Department inspector general and the U.S. Special Counsel, another investigative office.\\n\\nThe letter from the whistleblowers' lead attorney, David Z. Seide, decried the use of VOA to disseminate political propaganda in the waning days of the Trump administration. He argued it was yet another effort by Pack and Reilly to politicize the network and its parent agency. And the whistleblowers also alleged VOA's announced intention to broadcast the speech marks a violation of the firewall protections intended by statute and also in regulations swept aside by Pack last year.\\n\\nAccused of funneling charitable donations to a personal venture\\n\\nPack made his reputation as a conservative documentary maker; his for-profit film company, called Manifold Productions, has made such projects as Created Equal on U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It featured extensive interviews with the reclusive jurist and was released last year to a favorable response.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, D.C. Attorney General Racine accused Pack of establishing the non-profit Public Media Lab for the sole purpose of self-enrichment, shielding $4.1 million in tax-protected funds over 12 years to Manifold, his for-profit film venture. According to the lawsuit, Manifold received more than 99% of Public Media Lab's grants from 2008 to 2018. And that money constituted 60% of all its revenues from 2008 to 2019.\\n\\nRacine further alleged that the board obscured the relationship between the two entities. According to the lawsuit, Pack served as president and CEO of both Public Media Lab and the sole owner of Manifold Productions. He transferred ownership of Manifold to his wife, Gina Cappo Pack, in June 2020, when Pack took over USAGM.\\n\\nPack and his attorneys have not yet responded to the suit in court. Alan P. Dye, an experienced conservative not-for-profit lawyer and board member of Pack's Public Media Lab, rejected the allegations of wrongdoing contained in the lawsuit in a brief conversation with NPR. He said he was constrained from commenting further at this time.\\n\\nDemocratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey had sought to delay Pack's nomination vote, pointing to Racine's ongoing investigation. This week, noting the formal allegations contained in the lawsuit, Menendez tweeted that Pack's confirmation was a stain on the Senate and our country.\\n\\nIn October, a D.C. Superior Court judge ruled in another case brought by Racine that Pack had broken the law in firing board members over the Open Technology Fund, which is subsidized by USAGM. Pack had replaced the bipartisan board with one stocked with conservative activists and Trump administration officials.\\n\\nA plea for Biden's attention\\n\\nPack did the same with three other non-profit networks funded by USAGM and made himself board chairman over Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; Radio Free Asia; and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. He sought to force the networks to sign binding contracts ensuring that the boards could not be removed for two full years for any cause, and that board members could only be removed for cause subsequently, even though Biden aides have made clear he intends to replace Pack promptly.\\n\\nThat inspired the joint letter released Friday by former Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty presidents Tom Dine, Jamie Fly, Jeffrey Gedmin, Tom Kent, and Kevin Klose (who led NPR, among other things, in between two stints at the federal network). Fly was fired by Pack along with the heads of other networks last summer.\\n\\nThey cited what they called Pack's proposed radical changes in the governance of the networks. Credibility with audiences takes years to build and can be destroyed in days, they wrote. Mr. Pack's personnel and policy actions have sought to impose ideological coloration on programming and tight governmental and political control that risk destroying the credibility and effectiveness of al US international broadcasting.\\n\\nDisclosures: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR Tech and Media Editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published. Additionally, former NPR CEO Kevin Klose was twice president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and a signatory of the letter to President-elect Biden."}
{"original": "'Unimaginable' Suffering In South Sudan. Is There Any Hope?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Mednick/AP Sam Mednick/AP\\n\\nU.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told reporters in Geneva last month that the level of suffering in South Sudan is on an unimaginable scale and getting worse.\\n\\nAnd U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post that the country's leaders have failed the children of South Sudan.\\n\\nLast week, there were signs of hope for a better future in the world's newest nation. The president of South Sudan and his former vice president signed a cease-fire in the civil war that has ravaged the country for nearly five years.\\n\\nThe cease-fire went into effect last Saturday. Within hours, it had already been violated.\\n\\nBut aid organizations are hoping that one part of the cease-fire will remain intact: providing humanitarian access to the suffering people of South Sudan.\\n\\nNear-famine levels of hunger have already swept across large portions of the country and, with the onset of the rainy season, life-saving aid is becoming extremely costly to deliver.\\n\\nHealth workers are also bracing for an uptick in water-related illnesses, like cholera, malaria and diarrhea, which can be especially deadly when people are malnourished.\\n\\nAbout 63 percent of the population (more than 7 million people) is severely hungry, according to the World Food Program (WFP). Just under 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes and are internally displaced within the country, while another 2.5 million have fled to neighboring countries as refugees.\\n\\nSouth Sudan is now the largest producer of refugees on the continent and the third largest in the world, after Syria and Afghanistan, according to the UN refugee agency. About 65 percent of the refugees are under the age of 18.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Mednick/AP Sam Mednick/AP\\n\\nIn addition, aid workers are being abducted and killed, while 19,000 children are estimated to serve in armed forces and groups in a conflict that began when President Salva Kiir Mayardit accused his then-deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup in December 2013. What began as a political dispute quickly took on ethnic undertones between Kiir's Dinka — the country's ethnic majority — and Machar's Nuer, the second-largest ethnic group.\\n\\nEven before gaining independence in 2011, the people of South Sudan had suffered through decades of another devastating civil war.\\n\\nI think it's worth noting that Oxfam's worked in [the area that is now] South Sudan for more than three decades, said Noah Gottschalk, Oxfam's humanitarian policy lead in D.C. No one's ever seen it as bad as it is now. And I think that's saying an enormous amount. People who've lived through war and displacement and the deaths of close relatives are now finding themselves in an even worse situation than in the past.\\n\\nIn Pibor, for example — a county in the eastern part of the country — the Famine Early Warning Network (FEWSNET) reported in April that even though the official hunger level is emergency, more than 20 percent of households could be classed as hitting famine levels. The situation in Pibor is so dire that, according to the the U.K.-based Oxfam, some people are eating grasses and weeds out of desperation, although they are not safe for consumption and are making them sick.\\n\\nEven in other areas that are facing less severe levels of hunger, people are beginning to exhaust their usual coping mechanisms. They're having to sell household assets, like cattle and goats, according to Oxfam, while children roam the streets in search of food, Reuters has reported.\\n\\nPeople in South Sudan are incredibly resilient and incredibly strong, Gottschalk told NPR. But they're being stretched further than ever before.\\n\\nAccording to Gottschalk, the current crisis is the culmination of many negative trends.\\n\\nIt's quite a complicated situation, said Chris McElhinney, the country director in South Sudan for Irish charity GOAL Global. What we're seeing is a continued deterioration of the humanitarian requirements in the country and the needs that people face.\\n\\nAs is often the case, crises beget crises — and in South Sudan, the civil war catalyzed an economic collapse. By 2017, oil production — which makes up more than 99 percent of the country's export revenue and about 60 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) — had dropped to half its pre-war levels. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita fell from $1,111 in 2014 to less than $200 last year. In response to the fiscal deficit, the government printed more banknotes and, unsurprisingly, inflation soared.\\n\\nAt its highest, in September 2016, year-on-year inflation was 550 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. By September 2017, it had lowered to 102 percent. But inflation continues to perpetuate the hunger crisis, as prices rise and the value of the South Sudanese pound drops. Last year, the WFP estimated that a bowl of bean stew that costs a New Yorker $1, would cost a South Sudanese $321.\\n\\nTo fight the hyperinflation, the government last year decided to increase work permit fees for aid workers from $100 to $10,000.\\n\\nOn top of that, South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an aid worker. More than 100 aid workers, mostly South Sudanese, have been killed since the war began.\\n\\nAccording to the FEWSNET report, the only thing keeping some areas of the country from hitting a more severe hunger level is humanitarian assistance. But now that the rainy season has begun, not only are people running out of their harvested reserves, but roads to more than half the country, the lifeline for aid, could become inaccessible. This means that air drops are often the only means of delivery. It's a solution, but an expensive one.\\n\\nIn order to prevent South Sudan in 2018 from being worse than 2017 — when famine was officially declared in two Counties — the U.N.'s humanitarian response plan is calling for $1.72 billion.\\n\\nIt's a staggering amount of money, McElhinney said.\\n\\nLast year's humanitarian response plan raised $1.17 billion of the $1.6 billion it asked for. So far for 2018, donor countries, organizations and individuals — including the U.S., U.N. agencies and the World Bank — have contributed $706 million (just over 40 percent of what's needed). Objectively, that is a lot of money — just not nearly enough for the immense needs in South Sudan.\\n\\nEspecially for South Sudan's children, whose health, development and safety are being impacted the most, education is critical. A UNICEF report in December estimated that three out of four children are not in schools.\\n\\nOften we think about food, water, shelter as the things that people need to survive, Gottschalk said. But for a country to survive, education is needed as well.\\n\\nJoanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequity.

{"original": "Immigration, Infrastructure And Iran: The President's Plans For 2018\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Senate returns Wednesday, and President Trump made his way back to Washington on Monday after lying fairly low to end the year in Palm Beach, Fla., at his personal resort.\\n\\nHis first year was a mixed bag of legislative accomplishments (tax overhaul) and failures (health care), the book is still out on his foreign policy posture, and the Russia probe continues.\\n\\nSo what should we expect in 2018? There are four areas of domestic policy the president is particularly focused on, according to the White House — immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care.\\n\\nI would expect to see those four areas, as well as national security, which never goes away, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, per USA Today.\\n\\nMore pressingly, there is a Jan. 19 deadline to pass yet another spending bill to keep the lights on in the government.\\n\\nHere is a look at some of those key priority areas and variables:\\n\\nNational security\\n\\nThe president's team would make the case that the U.S. is safer now and that ISIS is on the run. But there have been lone wolf attacks domestically on this president's watch, including a truck attack in New York that killed eight people and another man's failed attempt to blow himself up in the New York subway.\\n\\nAttacks like these have prompted the president to move to curtail the immigration system further. His critics argue that doing so emboldens recruitment for those trying to pull off or inspire these kinds of attacks. So that will remain an area of political tension.\\n\\nIran\\n\\nThe president has tweeted support for protests against the current Iranian regime, while also opposing (yet not completely ripping up) the Iranian nuclear deal.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nAt least 21 people have been reported dead in Iran, as the regime has moved against the protesters. But it's still unclear what this president wants to do tangibly to effect change. Vice President Pence has brought up the difference from past administrations' approaches, but remember, back in 2009 when protests also cropped up, it was a very different kind of Iranian leadership that then-President Barack Obama was dealing with. Now, there is a more pragmatic leader in President Hassan Rouhani than there was in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. So what would change in Iran actually bring?\\n\\nWhat's more, Trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist America First policy. So there is a question about the Trump Doctrine: When does the United States intervene and when does it not? What is the trigger to say, OK, this is where the United States gets involved?\\n\\nNorth Korea\\n\\nAnyone who thought the North Korean leader would be cowed by a more saber-rattling U.S. stance was mistaken. Kim Jong Un took to state airwaves during the New Year's holiday weekend to tout that his country had made progress as a nuclear power — and that he has a button to launch attacks on his desk.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe White House says it remains focused on the denuclearization of North Korea. But the president also tweeted criticism of China, a key player in achieving that goal. And, ironically, it is China that is stepping forward as more of a world leader as the United States has receded, as some see it, under Trump.\\n\\nChina\\n\\nThe view from China of Trump? Yan Xuetong, dean of Tsinghua University's Institute of Modern International Relations, told The New Yorker:\\n\\nAmerican leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. In 1991, when Bush, Sr., launched the war against Iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort. This time, if Trump launched a war against anyone, I doubt he would get support from even five countries. For Chinese leaders, Yan said, 'Trump is the biggest strategic opportunity.' [New Yorker reporter Evan Osnos] asked Yan how long he thought the opportunity would last. 'As long as Trump stays in power,' he replied.\\n\\nSo, for as much as Trump might think Chinese President Xi Jinping likes him (He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of China), Xi might have a different reason for feeling that way than Trump thinks.\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nAs noted, for Trump, immigration is tied to national security. So don't expect him to pull back on his push to curtail various programs and make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based.\\n\\nDemocrats, though, feel as if they have leverage in this election year on the issue, especially because there is generally bipartisan support for a DREAM Act or a path to legalization, if not citizenship, for people in the U.S. illegally who haven't committed crimes. (The DREAM Act would provide a path to citizenship for people brought to the United States as children.)\\n\\nTrump said in September that he was giving Congress six months to address DACA, the executive action implemented by Obama on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. That means Congress has until March to do something. DACA allowed people brought to the country as children to avoid deportation. Obama signed the executive order after Congress failed to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration overhaul.\\n\\nWe think we have to have a DACA solution, House Speaker Paul Ryan told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Nov. 30.\\n\\nWe'll see shortly what that is or whether it is even true. Still, Trump's posture doesn't appear to be one through which a deal has been made. In fact, he tweeted Friday that any DACA deal must include building a wall with Mexico and ending both chain migration and the visa lottery system.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nInfrastructure is always dangled as a potentially big area of bipartisanship. Both parties say they want it, and yet nothing has gotten done in the past decade.\\n\\nWhy? The question of how to pay for it.\\n\\nYet, Trump teased that maybe we start with infrastructure in the new year.\\n\\nInfrastructure is by far the easiest, the president said Dec. 22 during the bill signing for the tax overhaul. People want it — Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure as you know. I could've started with infrastructure — I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.\\n\\nHaving it done pretty quickly could be an overstatement. Republicans are going to need 60 votes, which now means the support of nine Democrats or independents after Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday.\\n\\nWelfare, entitlements and health care\\n\\nRyan, R-Wis., has indicated that he would like to target welfare and entitlements, but Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are not on board with all that Ryan wants to do.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Portland Press Herald via Getty Images Portland Press Herald via Getty Images\\n\\nThe Trump administration is reviewing the programs, and the White House is preparing a January executive order related to welfare, according to Politico. NPR's Mara Liasson reports that the president wants to keep his promise not to touch the big, middle-class entitlements — Medicare and Social Security — but he is interested in reforming means-tested programs that target lower-income Americans.\\n\\nPolitics Republicans Talk Of Changes To Welfare Next Republicans Talk Of Changes To Welfare Next Listen · 4:51 4:51\\n\\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs affects about 1.5 million families, and Liasson reports:\\n\\nWhite House aides say they are now looking at a number of additional changes, including tighter work requirements and drug-testing rules for food stamps, Medicaid and housing assistance. Those changes may not save much money the way changes in the big middle-class entitlements like Medicare or Social Security might. But it will help the president highlight an issue that seems to motivate his base in a year when getting Republican voters excited is the No. 1 goal.\\n\\nThe Senate also seems to be less-than-enthused to change any of the big entitlements. McConnell, who will be clinging to an even narrower 51-49 majority in 2018, told Axios that he would not expect to see the Senate work on making changes to those programs without Democrats.\\n\\nI think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan, McConnell told NPR. The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it.\\n\\nTranslation: He is not about to walk the plank without holding hands with Democrats — and Democrats aren't going anywhere near the edge of that ship.\\n\\nIt's the same story when it comes to health care.\\n\\nWell, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate, McConnell told NPR. We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.\\n\\nDoes Ryan resign?\\n\\nSo if a tax overhaul has passed — and Ryan can't get his next agenda on entitlements, welfare or health care through the Senate, it does raise the question — does the speaker think about stepping aside in the next few months or after the election?\\n\\nRemember, this is not a job he wanted. He was seen as the only one who could get the votes to become speaker after John Boehner resigned. It has certainly been rumored that Ryan is considering resigning — and it makes some sense. At this point, it's just speculation, but worth watching.\\n\\nI ain't goin' anywhere, Ryan told reporters after a Dec. 14 Politico piece speculating on his resignation.\\n\\nHis office added, This is pure speculation. Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, As the speaker himself said today, he's not going anywhere any time soon.\\n\\nBoehner's representatives denied he was leaving up until right before he did.\\n\\nMidterms will shape the year\\n\\nNot much traditionally gets done in midterm years, McConnell is skittish about diving into the president's thornier priorities and Democrats feel they have some leverage now on things like immigration and infrastructure.\\n\\nSo don't expect them to jump at the chance to work with this president, in this election year, without major concessions."}
{"original": "In Phone Call With Xi, Trump Reaffirms U.S. Commitment To 'One China' Policy\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fabrice Coffrini/Getty Images Fabrice Coffrini/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump spoke to around 20 world leaders before calling China's president, Xi Jinping.\\n\\nBut he finally did it Thursday evening.\\n\\nAnd despite earlier remarks threatening to upend long-standing U.S. policy, Trump promised Xi that Washington will stick to the One China doctrine.\\n\\nThat policy was enacted when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with Beijing almost 40 years ago. It allows the U.S. to maintain relations with both China and a de facto independent Taiwan.\\n\\nBeijing considers Taiwan a province of China; the U.S. position is by design ambiguous, asserting that China and Taiwan are both parts of One China.\\n\\nA White House statement called the conversation lengthy and extremely cordial. The two leaders extended wishes to the other's peoples, and issued invitations to their respective countries.\\n\\nTrump appeared to break his awkward post-inauguration silence with Beijing when the White House announced on Thursday that he had sent a letter to Xi, expressing hopes for a constructive relationship and offering wishes for a prosperous Year of the Rooster. The letter was sent nearly two weeks after the start of Chinese New Year.\\n\\nThis makes Trump only the latest in a series of U.S. presidents who have railed against Beijing while on the campaign trail, only to be forced by geopolitical realities and U.S. business interests to fall back on established policies once in office.\\n\\nFor example, Ronald Reagan threatened to normalize ties with Taiwan in 1980. Bill Clinton called out the butchers of Beijing in 1992. George W. Bush in 2000 labeled China a strategic competitor.\\n\\nBut none of them made substantial moves to alter China policy after being elected. Chinese officials say they learned long ago to take the election-cycle posturing with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIn December, Trump enraged Beijing by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen after his election victory. That contravened decades of U.S. China policy that proscribed contact between the two countries' leaders. Taiwan paid former Sen. Bob Dole, working as a lobbyist, to arrange the call.\\n\\nThen Trump suggested he would scotch the One China policy unless Beijing made concessions on trade. He also complained that China wasn't doing enough to talk North Korea out of its nuclear ambitions. And Trump threatened to slap heavy tariffs on Chinese imports.\\n\\nThe U.S. president has appointed a number of pro-Taiwan critics of China to key Cabinet and advisory positions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested during his confirmation hearing that the U.S. should blockade disputed islands controlled by China in the South China Sea.\\n\\nTrump's long delay in communicating with Xi has reinforced China's fears of a confrontational new administration, at a time China can least afford it: the run-up to the ruling Communist Party's 19th National Congress this fall, where Xi is expected to secure a second five-year term.\\n\\nBeijing considers Taiwan's status as a province of China to be non-negotiable, and has threatened to invade the island if it declares independence.\\n\\nThe Trump-Xi phone call came on the eve of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's U.S. visit, which will include a weekend of golf with Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Beijing's relations with Japan are frosty.\\n\\nChina is frustrated and bewildered that the U.S. does not organize its Asia policy around relations with the region's preeminent power. Instead, Washington bases its policy on a series of Cold War-era military alliances with smaller nations around China's periphery that Beijing is convinced are designed to contain and thwart its ambitions."}

The results of a nationwide survey published by EY, a professional services firm, and Economic Innovation Group, a policy and advocacy group, suggest millennials' economic hardships prevent them from starting businesses.\\n\\nMillennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history, EIG co-founder John Lettieri told the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship earlier this year. Millennials admire startup founders and revere self-employment, the new survey findings show, but they're wary of starting businesses in an unforgiving economic environment.\\n\\nWith hordes of young people selling homemade clothing on Etsy, driving for Uber and opening food trucks on every corner, and with a much smaller group founding influential tech companies, this generation embodies the spirit of a startup culture.\\n\\nIn an op-ed, published on Mic.com, Hillary Clinton described the millennial generation as the most diverse and entrepreneurial generation in our country's history. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents shared her belief that millennials are more entrepreneurial than the previous generation.\\n\\nAnd yet, according to a study by the Small Business Administration, less than 2 percent of millennials in 2014 were self-employed, compared with 7.6 percent of Generation Xers and 8.3 percent of baby boomers. This suggests that millennials are failing to start businesses. And in 2015, the Brookings Institution reported steady declines in new business formation over the past decade. According to research by the Kaufman Foundation, young people accounted for 23 percent of new entrepreneurs in 2013, down from 35 percent in 1996. Clearly, millennials are failing to live up to their entrepreneurial reputation.\\n\\nThe EY/EIG survey data implicates financial barriers as the culprit of this failure to launch.\\n\\nA whopping 42 percent of respondents cited insufficient financial means as the biggest obstacle to starting a business. According to the report, millennials make less money and have higher levels of debt than previous generations. Fifty-three percent of respondents have student loan debt or are expecting to take on student loan debt in the future. And most of them worry about their ability to pay loans back. High levels of debt make it difficult for young people to save for retirement or obtain credit to start a business.\\n\\nThe report also suggests that financial insecurity has increased risk aversion among millennials. Only 22 percent of respondents believe starting a company would be the best way to advance their careers. Today's young people see launching startups as too risky given their cash-strapped reality.\\n\\nWhile they truly respect entrepreneurship, they worry that they will not be able to overcome the significant financial and regulatory hurdles associated with starting a business, says Kate Barton, EY Americas vice chair of tax services.\\n\\nOther notable takeaways of the survey include:\\n\\n62 percent of millennials have considered starting their own business.\\n\\n78 percent of survey respondents who know someone that has launched or worked for a startup consider that person successful.\\n\\n72 percent feel that startups and entrepreneurship are essential for promoting innovation and jobs.\\n\\n30 percent of all respondents and 40 percent of single respondents live with their parents.\\n\\n54 percent of millennials believe their standard of living will be lower than their parents.\\n\\n78 percent of millennials are worried about having good job opportunities.\\n\\n79 percent of millennials worried that they will not have enough money to retire.\\n\\n63 percent report that they would have difficult covering an unexpected $500 expense.\\n\\nMaria Hollenhorst is an NPR business desk intern."}
{"original": "Louise Linton Said She 'Sacrifices' More Than Other Taxpayers. It's Not That Simple\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Grimes/Getty Images for Grey Goose Martin Grimes/Getty Images for Grey Goose\\n\\nThis week's Trump presidency Internet sideshow (see also: Melania appearing to bat Trump's hand away, the president's aggressive handshakes, the frenzy over Kellyanne Conway's inauguration outfit) came in the form of a couture-heavy Instagram post from Louise Linton, a Scottish-born actress and the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\\n\\nWhen Linton highlighted her designer clothing and accessories (which together cost more than $13,000, as Vanity Fair estimated) after a trip to Kentucky with her husband, user jennimiller29 responded, Glad we could pay for your little getaway.\\n\\nLinton, in turn, handed her taunters more ammunition, condescending to jennimiller29 (Your life looks cute) and insulting that user for making less money than she does. Linton made her account private shortly after the post, but screenshots captured her reaction.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did, Linton said to jennimiller29. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours, she added, followed by a flexing biceps and a winking kissy face emoji. Linton apologized late Tuesday, as CNN reported.\\n\\nThis is the rare sideshow that gives us an excuse to dive into policy. Whether she knew it or not, Linton managed to run into one of the major ideas associated with a progressive tax system — the idea of equal marginal sacrifice.\\n\\nThe idea here, as economist Mark Thoma has put it, is that the last dollar paid [in taxes] should cause the same amount of disutility for everyone — disutility being econospeak for dissatisfaction, more or less.\\n\\nIn other words, not all dollars are created equal. Imagine a rich woman and a poor woman. The rich woman has a marginal tax rate of 40 percent — she gives up 40 cents of her last dollar of income. The poor woman, meanwhile, gives up 10 cents. (For simplicity's sake, we're assuming no tax credits or deductions here.)\\n\\nBy Linton's apparent logic, the absolute dollar amounts are what matter — 40 cents is bigger than 10 cents.\\n\\nBut the idea behind equal marginal sacrifice is that that 40 cents would be harder to part with for the poor woman than 40 cents would be for the rich woman. A progressive tax system, giving that poorer woman a lower tax rate, tries to balance out that pain.\\n\\nTo that poor person, paying 40 cents instead of 10 cents — or, to make this example more practically applicable, $40 instead of $10 — could cut heavily into basics like grocery or rent money. But for the rich person, that $40 is far less likely to be a necessity. Instead, it could cut into, say, the cost of an Hermès scarf.\\n\\nSo when Linton says that what she and her husband sacrifice per year is a lot more than what a not-nearly-as-rich American sacrifices, this principle dictates that in many cases, she may be wrong, because that sacrifice is relative.\\n\\nThe idea of equal sacrifice is one key argument proponents of progressivity use to back up their ideas, as Thoma wrote in a 2015 article.\\n\\nOf course, this general idea doesn't help a lot in laying out exact tax brackets. Assigning a numerical value to how much utility every single person gets from an additional dollar is impossible. People are just too different, explains one tax expert.\\n\\nIf everyone were the same and you had some kind of utility measure like a thermometer, you come up with an ideal system where the burden is the same for everybody, said Leonard Burman, co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. But the fact is there are some people who make millions of dollars who are still working really, really hard to make a little bit more, whereas there are others who realize they are really quite fortunate and really rather happy to pay their share towards keeping society going.\\n\\nGetting that millionth dollar is simply going to bring much more satisfaction to Person A than Person B (and Person C might differ as well, and so on).\\n\\nNot everyone holds equal sacrifice as a guiding principle of tax policymaking. Several 2016 Republican presidential candidates proposed flat taxes of some sort, for example (though some of those people included some sort of an offsetting deduction for lower earners). Candidates have many arguments they cite for why their tax plans are best: spurring economic growth, for example, or simplifying the tax code.\\n\\nWhatever their motivations (whether they have equal marginal sacrifice on the brain or not), most Americans do favor higher taxes on the rich — 63 percent of Americans believe upper-income Americans pay too little in taxes, according to Gallup.\\n\\nThat matters as Congress gears up to overhaul the tax code. House Republicans' tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the highest-income Americans, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis."}
{"original": "Why Trump's Speech To Congress Is Not A State Of The Union\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\\n\\nIt will certainly feel like a State of the Union on Tuesday night: The president will make a major speech to Congress. A bit more than half the room will applaud resoundingly while a bit less than half sit on their hands in that familiar and awkward display of partisanship. Members of Congress will invite guests that telegraph pointed political messages, and the TV commentators will tell us who they are.\\n\\nBut although the drinking game rules remain roughly the same, President Trump's speech is not a State of the Union. It's simply an address to a joint session of Congress.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\nThe president gives remarks at the invitation of the speaker of the House — in this case, Rep. Paul Ryan — and it's up to the speaker what the speech is called, says Gerhard Peters, co-director of the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\\n\\nRyan invited Trump to give an address and not a State of the Union speech. That's mainly out of tradition: Trump, like his predecessors in the first year of their presidencies, is assumed to be too new to the job of running the country to authoritatively describe the state of the nation.\\n\\nPresidential updates to Congress on how the country is faring are expressly called for in the Constitution. Article II, Section 3 declares: He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\n\\nBut there are no requirements for how often or what form it should take --although there has been some sort of annual State of the Union message since George Washington established the precedent in 1790. It was Ronald Reagan in 1981 who began the tradition of a presidential address to Congress about a month after taking office. Every president since then has done so, usually focusing on specific issues, like the budget or health care.\\n\\nIt's unclear how specific Trump will be with policy proposals in his address, but senior administration officials say the president will take an optimistic tone, focusing on economic opportunity, national security and the renewal of the American spirit — a contrast from his inaugural address, in which Trump described a country in crisis."}
{"original": "Week In Politics: Capitol Riot, Trump's 2nd Impeachment And Inauguration\\n\\nNPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen and Errin Haines of The 19th about the Capitol riot, President Trump's second impeachment and the incoming administration.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nWhen a week in politics feels like a month, we know it's a good time to pause and ask what just happened. Well, for the first time in U.S. history, a president was impeached for a second time. Also, we've learned more about how violent the insurrection at the Capitol was intended to be. The inauguration and more security threats loom. And the Biden-Harris administration is pushing forward with its plans for the next four years.\\n\\nWell, joining me now, Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow and policy director for the Romney presidential campaign. Welcome to you.\\n\\nLANHEE CHEN: Thank you.\\n\\nKELLY: And Errin Haines, editor-at-large of the news site, The 19th. Welcome to you.\\n\\nERRIN HAINES: Thank you. Thanks so much for having me.\\n\\nKELLY: We are going to kick off with the big-banner, historic news - an impeachment, a second impeachment, which this time included 10 Republican votes in the House. Congressman Kevin McCarthy was not one of them. He did not vote against the president, but he did say this.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: That doesn't mean the president is free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.\\n\\nKELLY: Lanhee, I'm going to let you take this one on first. And I should note for people listening that you are informally advising some Republican members. Speak to how fractured the Republican Party is after all of this and especially this week.\\n\\nCHEN: Well, I think there are significant divisions, and, you know, it goes a lot deeper than just how one feels about Donald Trump. I think there are questions about the future arc of where the party goes in terms of policy. I think there are great disagreements about how the Republican leadership ought to deal with the misinformation, frankly, that's been spread to a lot of voters, for example, about claims of election fraud recently.\\n\\nAnd I think a lot of these issues are going to get sorted out over the next few years. I think some of it's going to come in the form of elections, primary elections, in the coming years. But also, I think there has to be a very direct conversation between Republicans about what the party stands for - exactly what the agenda is and should be going forward. And I think all those questions will demonstrate the degree to which there is division but also the degree to which Republicans can come together in the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nKELLY: Well, and speaking of the coming weeks, I suppose we have a Senate trial to get through in those coming weeks. Errin Haines, let me bring you in. What struck you this week watching the second impeachment of Donald Trump?\\n\\nHAINES: Well, certainly, what was different this year from where we were really just about a year ago is that you did have those 10 Republicans joining Democrats, including the highest-ranking woman in the Republican Party, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming.\\n\\nYou know, it - hearing, you know, the case for or against impeachment, you know, on both sides was really striking. And hearing from Republicans, some of whom, you know, certainly were wanting accountability in terms of the insurrectionists but not wanting to go so far as to hold the president accountable despite the fact that he was at the Stop The Steal Rally just ahead of the storming of the Capitol and the weeks and weeks that he, you know, has perpetuated the false claims of a rigged election - not really wanting to tether him directly to the events of January 6 was really remarkable. And so I think that maybe foreshadows, you know, how a final vote may go once this goes over to the Senate along party lines and the justification for that.\\n\\nKELLY: Now, all of this - impeachment - is happening, of course, against the backdrop of a pandemic. We watch vaccines being slowly rolled out. And, of course, we're bearing witness to the staggering economic impact of this pandemic, which Joe Biden referenced last night when he announced his new $1.9 trillion pandemic plan.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: And it's not hard to see that we're in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis with a once-in-several-generations public health crisis. A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight. And there's no time to waste. We have to act, and we have to act now.\\n\\nKELLY: Errin, let me return to that number - $1.9 trillion. It feels crazy to ask is that enough (laughter), but would that be enough financial support for Americans to get through what the CDC is projecting will be the deadliest months of the pandemic, and they're still ahead?\\n\\nHAINES: Well, we are in the worst of the throes of this pandemic. And, you know, this huge challenge needs a huge response. And that is what President-elect Biden is proposing in this $1.9 trillion plan, which is going to provide wide-ranging relief, the campaign says, to millions of workers, including the women who have been disproportionately economically impacted by a pandemic that is not interested in the peaceful transfer of power, did not stop, you know, amidst, you know, a racial reckoning and did not stop even, you know, in the midst of that insurrection, where we saw members, you know, coming down with the coronavirus during the insurrection at the Capitol. And so, you know, a lot of these - the pillars of that plan are going to center around issues that have affected women, from child care to school reopenings...\\n\\nKELLY: Yeah.\\n\\nHAINES: ...To hunger to evictions.\\n\\nKELLY: Yeah. Lanhee, your thoughts on the Biden plan and, I suppose, whether Republican lawmakers will vote for it.\\n\\nCHEN: Well, I think there are elements in here that some Republicans have already expressed support for. For example, you had a few Republicans like Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley express support for expanded direct payments at the $2,000 level, which is essentially what this plus up in the Biden plan would do - increase the level of direct support to $2,000.\\n\\nI think that the question is going to be, of course, whether some of the other elements in this package that, quite frankly, probably don't belong in a COVID relief package - whether things like, for example, a debate over the minimum wage - if that is going to turn off some Republicans. But in my view, it's going to be very difficult for those Republicans who are already on the record supporting elements of this package - the enhanced unemployment insurance, the direct payments, you know, assistance for COVID-19 vaccine distribution...\\n\\nKELLY: Yeah.\\n\\nCHEN: ...It will be a challenge for those Republicans to then turn around and oppose elements of this simply because Joe Biden is the one that's put them on the table instead of a...\\n\\nKELLY: We just have a...\\n\\nCHEN: ...Republican president.\\n\\nKELLY: Forgive me - we just have a minute or so left. But a quick parting thought from each of you as we look ahead to what promises to be another remarkable week in politics - an inauguration in what is basically a green zone. The Mall is closed, the outgoing president - President Trump - says he's not going to be in attendance. What are you watching for next week, Lanhee?\\n\\nCHEN: Well, I'm hoping that the country can begin to come together, and we can begin to deal with some of these challenges. I do think it's important that Congress takes up action on this stimulus package quickly in order to help move the country ahead and begin to heal some of these divisions that we've seen.\\n\\nKELLY: Errin Haines - last word to you.\\n\\nHAINES: Well, we are marking this inauguration in the wake of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday. And I leave you with this quote from King who said that in the days ahead, we must not consider it unpatriotic to raise certain basic questions about our national character.\\n\\nKELLY: Well, there are certainly a lot of questions about our nation and its character and what may come next. That is Errin Haines, editor-at-large of The 19th news site, and Lanhee Chen, Hoover Institution fellow and policy director for the Romney 2012 presidential campaign.\\n\\nThank you to you both.\\n\\nCHEN: Thank you.\\n\\nHAINES: Thank you.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF DATA'S ELECTRIC FEVER)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Even With Failures, North Korea's Nuclear Program Races Ahead\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lee Jin-man/AP Lee Jin-man/AP\\n\\nIn a cavernous, dimly-lit auditorium in Washington last month, three officials took the stage.\\n\\nThey settled themselves into tan, leather armchairs and fielded questions, including this one: Name a global flashpoint you're looking to with concern?\\n\\nNorth Korea, came the reply from one. And how the United States and China deal with that situation.\\n\\nThe exchange is worth noting because the three people on stage were current or former CIA officials.\\n\\nThe one who gave the North Korea answer? Dennis Wilder, who has spent his career grappling with North Korea, including from senior perches at the National Security Council and the CIA. The occasion was a rare, public conference on intelligence, hosted by the CIA and George Washington University on Sept. 20.\\n\\nWilder isn't the only one sounding the alarm on the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. Last week, the U.S. and South Korea say they detected a failed North Korean missile test, probably of Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles. And last month, Pyongyang conducted a fifth nuclear test.\\n\\nThe (U.S.) president-elect is going to face a problem from North Korea that none of his predecessors — or her predecessors — have faced, says Jami Miscik, former CIA deputy director for intelligence. It is well on the way to becoming not just a nuclear power, but a power able to deliver a nuclear missile.\\n\\nFailures help North Korea learn\\n\\nMiscik, who today serves as co-CEO of Kissinger Associates and co-chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, was speaking last week at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit.\\n\\nNorth Korea is one of the issues we aren't paying enough attention to, she said. The fact these rocket launches are failing shouldn't give anybody comfort, because they're not failing for the same reason — they fail and they fix that thing. It might fail for another reason, but they're advancing in terms of their capability.\\n\\nElbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official now at the Center for a New American Security, says it's already worrying that an unpredictable, isolated regime like North Korea has nuclear weapons.\\n\\nBut it's another whole level when you get a ballistic missile that can travel very fast and is hard to intercept, and can reach not just South Korea and Japan but the United States itself. And that's the real game changer, said Colby.\\n\\nDoes he take heart from the fact that North Korea's tests often fizzle or outright fail?\\n\\nNot really. Because it depends on what you're trying to do, he said. You may be trying to test the edges of your capability, and you can still also get data from your failed tests.\\n\\nConstant nuclear activity\\n\\nDennis Wilder, the former CIA officer we met in that dark auditorium, points to North Korea's five nuclear tests so far, including the one in September. He also points to the North's 23 recent missile tests, including the one last week.\\n\\nWhat we're seeing now is an unprecedented level of activity, he said.\\n\\nWilder believes that North Korea is on track to be able to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-armed missile within the next five years. And that may not even be the worst news.\\n\\nIn an interview in his office at Georgetown University, where he's now a professor, Wilder noted that North Korea today is believed to have enough fissile material for somewhere between 10 and 20 nuclear weapons.\\n\\nA new Rand study says he could have 50, by 2020. That is scary, says Wilder — and not just because North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un would have so many at his disposal. The truly frightening prospect, Wilder argues, is that Kim might decide to export.\\n\\nI was in the Bush White House [in 2006] when we found out that the North Koreans had sent nuclear technology to Syria, he said. It was a shock to the entire world. I don't want to have the same lack of imagination on this issue.\\n\\nNorth Korea is broke, and selling nuclear material could bring in desperately needed cash.\\n\\n'Lousy policy options'\\n\\nSo, what should the U.S. do?\\n\\nWilder argues that the only path forward is persuading China to use its leverage. He also jokes that North Korea is the land of lousy policy options.\\n\\nAt the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Tuesday, the director of U.S. national intelligence, Jim Clapper, argued that it may well be a lost cause to try to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\\n\\nThey are not going to do that, he said. That is their ticket to survival.\\n\\nThe best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap, but they are not going to do that just because we ask them. There's going to have to be some significant inducements, said Clapper.\\n\\nU.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby briefed reporters shortly after Clapper's remarks, stating that U.S. policy remains achieving a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in New York, the United Nations Security Council is drafting new sanctions in light of the latest nuclear test.\\n\\nFrom Pyongyang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already shot back: It is a complete miscalculation to think that sanctions or pressure can have any effect on us."}

Thank you so much, Ron, for being with us.\\n\\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Leila.\\n\\nFADEL: So, Ron, does the president have the authority to do this, to target and kill a top-level military official of a country we're not at war with?\\n\\nELVING: Tricky question. Let's go back to the week after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Congress passed an authorization for the use of military force against terrorists. And we've seen presidents use that to target and kill people we've called terrorists ever since - Osama bin Laden, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Those are the big names, but there have been thousands targeted in drone strikes, most of which never make the news.\\n\\nAnd we've seen Congress and the public by and large accepting and even applauding this policy. And that's why we keep hearing Soleimani described as a terrorist. But as you say, he is also a top-level military official of a sovereign country we are not at war with, so international standards are going to be different here and the consequences as well.\\n\\nFADEL: So what's been the reaction from members of Congress?\\n\\nELVING: You have, on one hand, Rand Paul of Kentucky - he's a Republican - and he's been saying this is the end of diplomacy and negotiation and the beginning of war with Iran. But more generally, it's been predictably partisan and polarized. The president's allies say it's about time somebody got this guy. And Democrats are saying they're glad Soleimani is gone, but Congress should have been consulted or at least notified, and the usual protocol of notice was not followed here. So maybe it's OK this time because it's him, but where does this end?\\n\\nFADEL: Last night President Trump spoke to a coalition of evangelicals for Trump at the King Jesus International Ministry in Miami. What did he say about the killing?\\n\\nELVING: He said Soleimani had wounded or killed thousands, including hundreds of Americans. He called it a bloody rampage. He also said Soleimani was plotting against Americans, planning a very major attack in the near future. We do not know what the basis for that might have been, that last allegation, but it was enough for this president.\\n\\nFADEL: What's the impact on the other main issue hanging over Washington right now - the upcoming impeachment trial?\\n\\nELVING: It's an enormous distraction in terms of public attention. Something else is suddenly front and center, but it doesn't alter the impeachment process, which is in a state of suspended animation right now anyway. Just yesterday, we heard the two leaders of the parties in the Senate saying they had made no progress on a set of rules for the trial. So now, we have two crises in Washington, and they may be on a collision course.\\n\\nFADEL: So we're also weeks out from the first presidential primary and caucus. Does this event box in the Democrats who are running to replace the president?\\n\\nELVING: There is a standard response if you're running for president as a Democrat. You say Soleimani was a bad guy; we're glad to have him gone, but then you raise at least a question about the manner in which this was done and all the people who were left in the dark about it. Is the president, in fact, all powerful now, an autocrat who can kill as he wishes overseas as long as it's someone we can call a terrorist? And is President Trump, the president who said he wanted to end the endless wars in the Middle East, is he now on the verge of starting a new one with a major regional power in Iran?\\n\\nFADEL: And so I guess we'll see how voters respond.\\n\\nELVING: We will, indeed. The voters get the last word in 10 months. And by then, we will have seen how Iran responded, how the United States responded to that. We don't really know where this will go.\\n\\nFADEL: NPR's Ron Elving. Thank you so much.\\n\\nELVING: Thank you, Leila.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Entering Final Primary Stretch, Clinton And Sanders Fight For A California Win\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Locher/AP John Locher/AP\\n\\nCalifornia wasn't supposed to be close. In early polling, Hillary Clinton had a commanding lead, but that lead has all but vanished. A new survey from the Public Policy Institute of California has Clinton in a virtual tie with Bernie Sanders among Democratic primary likely voters — 46 percent support Clinton while 44 percent support Sanders.\\n\\nThe Golden State, which holds its presidential primary June 7, is a big, liberal, delegate-rich prize in what has been a long and increasingly bitter primary fight.\\n\\nAnd both candidates are fighting to win California. Clinton wrapped up a four-day swing Friday, while Sanders is in the midst of a weeklong barnstorming of the state.\\n\\nSanders pointed out recent polls with some glee at a rally in Santa Monica earlier this week. She's looking very nervous lately, he said. And I don't want to get her more nervous, so if you promise not to tell her, we're going to win here in California.\\n\\nClinton, meanwhile, has been more focused on the general election than on the primary.\\n\\nSend a message, she said in San Francisco. Send a message to a demagogic, rhetorically divisive and dangerous candidate that when you think about the future you don't see Donald Trump's face up there.\\n\\nThe reality is, with all the superdelegates who have announced their support for Clinton and her very large lead in pledged delegates, Clinton will almost certainly clinch the nomination before the polls even close in California. So why is she competing so hard in the state?\\n\\nIt's all about psychology, says Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.\\n\\nShe wants to end the primary campaign on a high note, and losing California would end it on a low note, he said. She wins the nomination, but loses the psychological warfare to Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nAs Clinton has traveled the state, the reception hasn't been entirely friendly.\\n\\nIn Salinas, a mix of what looked to be Trump and Sanders supporters gathered outside a Clinton event. They chanted and waved signs about her speech transcripts, email server and relatively hawkish foreign policy views.\\n\\nClinton supporter John Silva was puzzled by the protesters.\\n\\nYou're either with Hillary or you're with Trump, he said.\\n\\nSilva was wearing a black T-shirt with big white letters reading Dump Trump and admits he is more motivated against Trump than he is for Clinton. Silva initially supported Bernie Sanders, but now he plans to vote for Clinton in the primary.\\n\\nYou know, I wish it would end so that all the concentration would be against Trump and the Democratic Party can unite against Trump, Silva said. That would be a big plus for the party, and I think for America.\\n\\nClinton needs more voters like Silva if she's going to unite the party. She has started making that pitch in California.\\n\\nWe, Sen. Sanders and I, our supporters together, have so much more in common together than we do with Donald Trump, she said in San Jose.\\n\\nEven a California loss for Clinton wouldn't really change the race, because she and Sanders would very likely split the state's delegates, says Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. He worked on the Clinton campaign in 2008.\\n\\nI think they would like to send a stronger message, he said, but at the end of the day the nomination process is about math much more than it is about momentum. Math beats momentum every time.\\n\\nThat's probably not what Sanders and his supporters will be saying heading into the July Democratic convention if he is able to pull off a win in California. A Golden State victory would be a big part of Sanders argument to superdelegates that they should flip and support him."}
{"original": "Will The Millions Of People Who Gave Money To Bernie Sanders Give To Democrats?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nNo other major party presidential candidate has ever made it through primary season financing a campaign the way Bernie Sanders has. The Vermont senator and self-described Democratic socialist did not throw swanky receptions to court donors who could write $2,700 checks, the limit allowed by law. Nor did Sanders encourage wealthy friends to launch a superPAC funded with unlimited contributions.\\n\\nInstead, he relied on donors who gave small amounts online, over and over.\\n\\nAn unusual and recurring element of Sanders' boisterous rallies has been the recitation of the finance report. That's when Sanders boasts of the millions of individual contributions his campaign received, with the crowd roaring, Twenty-seven dollars! — the average donation amount, and a remarkably low number in campaign finance circles.\\n\\nWhat is revolutionary about that, Sanders said at a rally last month in Kentucky, is we have shown the world that we can run a winning national campaign without being dependent on powerful and wealthy special interests.\\n\\nWhile Sanders ultimately fell short of getting the delegates he needed to secure the Democratic nomination, his campaign has been revolutionary. Now the question is whether the revolution will live on, especially for Democratic candidates down the ballot?\\n\\nThe message and the money\\n\\nCampaign manager Jeff Weaver recalled the heady days of last fall, when we were looking at budgets, and looking at $30 million and thinking that perhaps we could get to 50.\\n\\nA strong presence online was critical for Sanders. He delivered a strong, ideological message that resonated with his supporters. And he made them feel needed.\\n\\nDonors understand that that contribution is much more critical to the success of the campaign, Weaver said. And you know, that feeling is justified, because it's exactly right. When you only rely on small donors, every one of those $27 [contributions] is critically important.\\n\\nSanders isn't the only candidate to score big with small donors this year. For Republican Ted Cruz, they gave $37 million, about one-third of the campaign committee's budget. Like Sanders, Cruz's financial success was due to a connection with voters who felt estranged from the party's establishment.\\n\\n[Cruz] had always been a favorite, and still is a favorite and a hero to the right, especially to the grass-roots side of things, said Trace Anderson, a grass-roots and finance consultant to Cruz. But it certainly blew all of our expectations, in the terms of the dollars raised.\\n\\nUnlike Sanders, however, Cruz also benefited from an armada of billionaire-backed superPACs that raised an additional $67 million.\\n\\nA lucrative list\\n\\nSanders finishes the primary season with a fundraising list of some 2.5 million contributors, including legions of millennials new to politics.\\n\\nIt's largely a younger list, said Anthony Corrado, a political scientist who studies campaign finance at Colby College. I expect it includes many new donors that aren't amongst the traditional source of candidate or party finance.\\n\\nBut Corrado said it's not a given that the list can work magic for others. The variable, he said, is whether they are largely Sanders donors, or whether he has tapped into a large cohort of progressive individuals who are going to be responsive to candidates who adopt progressive policy issues.\\n\\nSanders has already deployed the list to help 13 down-ballot progressives. The fundraising, with Sanders's imprimatur, was a success. But in the first contest for any of them, Lucy Flores of Nevada lost her House primary bid Tuesday.\\n\\nDemocratic fundraising consultant Mike Fraioli said he's skeptical the list's magic can be spread widely among Democrats. It's tough to convert donors like that. I don't think it's a message that easily moves to another candidate or another committee.\\n\\nWith the uncertainty, many mainstream Democrats may still find it too scary to go after small donors, and abandon the tried and true big-donor approach."}
{"original": "We Need To Be Able To Feel For one critic, 2020 scrambled long-held beliefs on objectivity and community.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gulnara Khamatova/Courtesy of the artist Gulnara Khamatova/Courtesy of the artist\\n\\nI can think of no better summation of our shared experience over the last year than A World Lost, the title of the piece that opens Maria Schneider's Data Lords. A slow, foreboding dirge in an oblong time signature, it instantly sets a tone of somber contemplation. Revisiting it now, as an overture to the most critically acclaimed jazz album of 2020, I hear a chronicle of pained nostalgia — mindful of the unbearable losses of life and livelihood, and the more slippery deprivations of place and custom, that marked the past year. I also think of all the old rituals that knitted a constituency into a scene, and how many of those were taken for granted.\\n\\nSchneider knows this heartsick constellation of feelings well, but her intention behind A World Lost came from another time and place. As she told NPR Music when the album was released in July, she was thinking about the wide-open, daydreamy internal landscapes that we, as individuals and as a society, are often guilty of smothering with a flood of unfiltered input and twitchy distraction. Last summer, she muses in her liner notes (referring to 2019, not 2020), an old high school classmate told me how kids in our hometown no longer socially gather to the degree we did years ago. He said kids largely keep isolated, as they're drawn into their individual electronic worlds. When I reread that anecdote early last week — just after the holiday break, as my own children were plugging back into their school-issued Chromebooks at our dining room table — it struck an even more despondent chord than the ones Schneider wrote into the song.\\n\\nFrank Kimbrough sounds the first of those chords at the piano: His low, tolling motif establishes the mood of A World Lost, with a shadowy grace that was his trademark in the Maria Schneider Orchestra for more than a quarter-century. The last time I heard the band in person, at the Jazz Standard in New York in December of 2019, those nuances of tone in Kimbrough's playing — projected clearly, somehow, from within the richly textured 18-piece orchestra — were among the details I savored. I also vividly recall Kimbrough's Cheshire grin as he ambled over during the break to engage in some of the usual self-deprecation, and to inquire after the family.\\n\\nThis memory haunts me, because the final month in the year of our collective dread 2020, as Ann Powers indelibly put it in a soulful essay not long ago, began and ended for me in stunned sorrow. On Dec. 2, the Jazz Standard announced that it would not reopen post-pandemic, joining a growing list of independent venues to fall permanently to the coronavirus recession. Then on Dec. 30, Kimbrough died of an apparent heart attack (not, as far as we know, because of COVID). These two departures felt inextricable as soon as I was able to process them. Without realizing it, I'd been holding on to the idea of some moment in the shapeless future when I would be settling my tab at the Standard, and all of a sudden Frank Kimbrough is clasping a hand on my shoulder, saying something like Look out, this man is dangerous. The gathering place, the social graces. The rug pulled out from under us, again.\\n\\nI was just starting in on Kimbrough's obituary — one of about 30 that I wrote in 2020 — when my phone pinged. It was a message from another leading jazz pianist, Aaron Parks: Oh man, Kimbrough. Damn this year. This was a small gesture, but a welcome reminder: there were flickers of light and grace in our terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year. And among the many changes forced upon us, there were a few that bloomed from within — regarding my self-identity as a critic, my relationship to a community and the responsibilities inherent in each of those roles. Here, let me explain.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe Sultan Room is a hallucinatory head trip of a club nestled along a gentrifying block of Bushwick, Brooklyn. When it opened in the summer of 2019 — part of a kitsch complex that also included a Turkish supper club and a takeaway kabob counter — the venue was hailed for its eclectic programming. But the Sultan Room's most distinctive attribute might best be described as a vibe. Those geometric lines and psychedelic lighting, the crisp sound and intimate scale, all added up to a trippy but welcoming air in the room, along with a hint of the otherworldly. It was the perfect spot to experience pianist Kris Davis' insinuative, exploratory Diatom Ribbons project, in a Winter Jazzfest showcase almost precisely one year ago.\\n\\nDiatom Ribbons, the album, took No. 1 in the 2019 NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll. Those results were still a couple of days out at the time of the show, last Jan. 12. But there was electricity in the air regardless — even by the heightened standards of Winter Jazzfest, an industry summit and musical Choose-Your-Own-Adventure that I've come to regard as the most frenetically sociable time of the year. I remember walking into the neon grotto of the Sultan Room and encountering a dozen different colleagues I'd missed while dashing in and out of a week's worth of shows and panels.\\n\\ntoggle caption Dave Kaufman\\n\\nThe warmth of our conversations, in between sets, mirrored the spirit on the bandstand. Diatom Ribbons was the byproduct of a collaboration between Davis, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and turntablist Val Jeanty, and they formed a magic triangle on the stage, the intensity of their listening almost creating a vortex in the room. They were joined by tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, bassist Trevor Dunn and others; Esperanza Spalding hopped on to recite a poem. On social media, I posted pics from that night (including a blazing opening set by bassist Harish Raghavan) with a breathless caption: Why is improvised music so vital in the 2020s? Plenty of reasons — and a good many of them were in the house at the Sultan Room tonight.\\n\\nCould that all have been just a year ago? Time, as we know, has gone haywire. The charge in the room that night is easy to recall, but so much else about the moment feels like a fading echo from some faraway place. A World Lost. I caught other gigs, some of them excellent, in the two months between Winter Jazzfest and the onset of lockdown in New York. One evening I recall with unusual clarity was in late February at the Yamaha Piano Salon in Midtown, when I emceed a concert for WBGO featuring drummer Alison Miller and pianist Carmen Staaf. Most of what I remember is the effortless collegiality between the two musicians, and the way they lovingly accessed the jazz tradition without a trace of obeisance to it. But what also springs to mind is a moment before the concert, when several WBGO board members stood around discussing their concerns about the coronavirus, which we knew so little about. Six weeks later, one of those board members died of COVID.\\n\\nI've mused aloud before about the grief shouldered by the jazz community last year, especially during that ghastly stretch in the spring. At the end of 2020, Jazz Night in America paid tribute with an In Memoriam radio episode, and commissioned trumpeter Keyon Harrold to perform an elegy. So there's no reason to restate the scope of our losses here — except maybe to point out that the artists we mourned were part of a larger musical ecology that also vanished, at least for the foreseeable future. What will that ecosystem resemble when clubs can feasibly reopen, and festivals start booking again, and artists can go back out on tour? I wonder whether this global reset can foster a more sustainable, more equitable, more accessible future for the music. There'll be so much ground to regain, so much rebuilding to do. But based on an array of conversations with musicians, arts presenters and my fellow writers over the last several months, I sense an opening.\\n\\n***\\n\\nA disaster of this magnitude turns every critic into an advocate. For many of us, of course, that function was already part of the equation. But as I look back on our distorted timeline, I'm struck by how great a percentage of my energy was devoted to crisis response: detailing the collapse of an infrastructure; sounding the call for public support; spreading the word about everything from a relief fund to a Bandcamp Friday release. Everything felt pressurized by a desperate sense of purpose. I blame this feeling for the fact that it was much more difficult than usual to produce a ballot for the critics' polls; what do rankings really matter when the world is falling down?\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nThe first pandemic story that I filed was a news report for Morning Edition on the effect that venue and festival cancelations would have on the jazz economy; it featured an interview with British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, whose band Shabaka and the Ancestors had been ramping up for a major tour. That story broadcast on March 19, the same day NPR Music published a piece I wrote about Aaron Parks and his tentative decision to proceed with a new album announcement. (His lead single was Solace, an apt offering, though he could also have gone with Is Anything Okay?) The album-release engagement for his Little Big II: Dreams of a Mechanical Man was then still scheduled for the middle of May — and it's unclear whether clubs in New York will be back in business again, I wrote. My assessment turned out to be a lot less perceptive than one articulated by Parks.\\n\\nIt's a really, really sad situation, he said, extrapolating on what he'd seen unfolding abroad. I'm not sure how ready we are for that. We're probably going to want to hide from how we feel, to a certain extent — to put up buffers and protect ourselves — but I do think we really need to be able to feel. We need to have that empathy within ourselves wide awake during a time like this. Just being concerned with our own individual safety and comfort, that's not going to cut it.\\n\\nJazz critics have always had a complicated relationship with jazz musicians. It's complicated not only for the obvious reasons — that unfortunate mix of imprecise craft, unchecked bias, and conflict of interest that once led the legendary record producer Orrin Keepnews to declare jazz criticism a bad idea, poorly executed — but also because of a lurking codependence at its core. When musicians carp about the uselessness of critics, I tend to keep my disagreement to myself. Because while I firmly believe that a robust criticism is crucial to the well-being of any art form, I'm also aware of how easy it is to drop the ball, and how much damage can blithely be done.\\n\\nPartly because of the role models I had as a young critic almost 25 years ago, I've long taken pains to preserve a respectful distance between myself and the artists I covered. Without falling for the myth of pure objectivity, I placed my faith in the idea of boundaries. When I joined Facebook in 2008, I made the gut decision not to accept friend requests from musicians, later going so far as to explain my policy in JazzTimes. One artist dinged me for inflated self-importance, a fair judgment. Still, the alternative seemed so messy and compromised. As a workaday critic, my obligation was clear, at least to me. It wouldn't help anyone to pull my punches, or change my compass, on account of personal allegiance. Fairness is the whole point. Right? Why would that ever change?\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe pandemic took so many things from us, but it gave us a few things too. For my household, a deeper bond emerged in the fraught stillness of lockdown. Musicians improvised new ways of connecting with listeners, and with each other. As our interminable spring yielded to summer, many awakened to the urgent cause of #BlackLivesMatter, on a scale we'd never seen before — a direct response to the horrors unfolding on our screens, in a virtual town square momentarily uncluttered by the usual rhythms of work and play. The first time my family ventured into an actual town square, breaking the sanctity of our bubble, it was for a protest march that felt both like a civic duty and in some ways a privilege: Here was the spirit of community we'd so dearly missed, conscientiously masked and distanced, united in voice and mission.\\n\\nIt was around this time that Aaron Parks and his wife, María José Galindo, moved to Beacon, N.Y., the Hudson Valley town that I've called home for the last decade. After hearing about this through a mutual acquaintance, I sent Parks a welcoming email. Without giving the matter much thought, I floated the idea of a backyard social call, though we hadn't yet crossed that line with anyone other than a next-door neighbor. It took a few weeks, but one afternoon in late August there we were, sitting in lawn chairs a comical distance apart, watching my daughters play with the Parks' puppy. We talked about puppy care — we were about to get one of our own — and Beacon landmarks, and pandemic surreality. María was seven months pregnant, so we talked about the excitement and anxiety of a new baby, too. It all felt perfectly natural, which on further reflection seemed like the only unnatural thing about it.\\n\\nI think that yes, there was some element of it that in normal time might have felt stranger, Parks said recently of that afternoon. But in those days, the idea of what roles we would play as musician and critic, that stuff all fell away. It was just like, 'Here's a family that's trying to figure out how to adjust to life in this strange new world as well.'\\n\\nLess than three weeks later, my family got that puppy. And in short order, at the Parks' invitation, we joined a small circle of locals who gathered with their dogs in a field down the street; in a text thread, this confab called itself Puppy Crew. Over the next month or so, I found myself conversing with Parks a few times a week, in actual physical proximity, while the dogs ran. Along with the small talk, there were conversations about music, and tentative efforts to reboot the scene. Among his core musical affiliations is one with Carrington, in her protest-minded Social Science band; when she was announced as a 2021 NEA Jazz Master, we talked about how deserving she is of the honor, in a way that felt unburdened by decorum, and unselfconsciously human.\\n\\nDaniela Yohannes/Courtesy of ECM Records\\n\\nThe same was true when we discussed a piece I reported about Keith Jarrett for the New York Times, sharing the sad news that due to a series of strokes, he may never play the piano in public again. Few jazz artists have ever had a more contentious relationship with critics than Jarrett — I once saw him berate a colleague by name from the Carnegie Hall stage — while being the beneficiary of so much fawning coverage. I've reviewed Jarrett in concert, both in solo piano mode and with the blue-chip trio he led for 30 years with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette. Whenever I did, I took pains to be evenhanded, assuring myself that a mixed or even tough assessment was justified by critical candor. But to hear Jarrett talk about his creative output is to hear a man speaking about his whole self, his experience in the world (and in his head) up to that moment. I'm not sure I fully reckoned with the implications of that idea until we were on the phone lamenting the dimensions of what he'd lost.\\n\\nPeacock, who died in 2020, is part of that wreckage. But the most heartbreaking realization about Jarrett's circumstance was the idea that he felt severed from both the piano and his public. I believe the pandemic, which stripped away so much of our social binding, intensified reaction to the piece; it was that much easier to imagine his isolation. Some readers reached out to say it felt like mourning a death.\\n\\nDays after the story dropped, I ventured out to The Falcon, an excellent venue not far from Beacon, which had found a workaround for New York state's restrictions on live music by presenting unbilled shows on an outdoor stage. This show featured keyboardist John Medeski, guitarist Marc Ribot and drummer Joe Dyson — only my third time hearing a band in person since early March. Aaron and María met me and a friend there, and we sat in our parkas enjoying dinner before the set. DeJohnette was at a nearby table with his wife, Lydia, and we all talked briefly about how everyone had been holding up.\\n\\nThe outrageous good fortune of that evening — the miracle of the music, the fellowship, the sensation of something being quenched — stretched into the wee hours, when María delivered her baby, Lucas River Parks. She was definitely in early labor during that concert, without being aware of it, Aaron reflects now. The music started a rhythm that just never stopped. It carried us right on through until 4:50 a.m.\\n\\nDuring the set, there had been moments when Dyson's drumming in particular caused both of us to shake our heads, murmuring low, appreciative noises. At one point I leaned over to remark how DeJohnette might be experiencing this performance, by an exemplary young inheritor of his style. In fact, Parks was so taken with Dyson's groove that he asked him to join his quartet for a forthcoming gig at The Jazz Gallery. It's happening as a livestream on Jan. 21, with Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone and Ben Street on bass. My critical opinion is that it will be well worth watching. I'd hasten to add a disclosure, but that's probably unnecessary if you've read this far.\\n\\nWhen I reflect on how much suffering the pandemic has inflicted, I also try to remember the things it made possible — not in some kind of silver-linings gloss but as a matter of perspective. I've discussed this with Aaron, the notion of counting our blessings. I think of not only Lucas himself but the fact that I was in town for the entirety of María's pregnancy, he says. I don't know that I would ever have been able to take this amount of time off the road. It's something that just wouldn't have happened without this. This, of course, meaning the pandemic and everything it put on hold, while we did our best to make sense of so many endings and beginnings.\\n\\n***\\n\\nHits different — perhaps you've encountered this coinage over the last year or so, since its leap from a corner of YouTube fandom into the mainstream lexicon of social media. The extraordinary solo piano album that Jarrett released last year, Budapest Concert, hits different with the knowledge that it's a souvenir of his final tour. Hooded procession (read the names outloud), the elegiac closing track from Ambrose Akinmusire's latest album, hits different in light of the #SayHerName chants following the death of Breonna Taylor — even though, as the song urges us to consider, the underlying injustice goes back farther than any of us can recall.\\n\\nAs we lumber into a new season of hope and heartbreak, watching the news for portents, I'm aware of some kind of rewiring in my own perceptions. The critical apparatus I've honed, over a lifetime of receptive listening, feels changed in some undeniable way. I'm beginning to understand that the whole dutiful scaffolding of dispassionate remove — a policy passed down as if etched on stone tablets — may have always been more about protecting the critic than serving the music. What would it feel like to refuse the safety of that position? To recenter the discipline with a more humanist aim? To weigh the edicts of an arbiter against all the mitigating factors, including those I bring to the table myself?\\n\\nI can only begin to answer these questions, and so far the answer is that it feels destabilizing. It may help to explain why I've lately been drawn to some music for extramusical reasons — drawing a particular sustenance, for instance, from the network of relationships connecting Micah Thomas' Tide to Immanuel Wilkins' Omega to Joel Ross' Who Are You? to Rob Mazurek's Dimensional Stardust to Nicole Mitchell and Lisa E. Harris' Earthseed. Instead of a list of albums, I thought about a matrix of connections. I thought about the positive musical embodiment of a superspreader — like guitarist Jeff Parker, who turned up on at least six terrific albums in 2020, including his own Suite For Max Brown.\\n\\nOne of the last phone conversations I had in 2020 was with Maria Schneider, hours after we'd both learned that Frank Kimbrough was gone. I was seeking a quote for his obit, but in the fog of our mutual shock and sadness, it felt more like we were sharing consolations. Speaking through tears, Schneider made the suggestion that certain musical relationships achieve a sort of deep connection that isn't available even to the closest friends and family. Night after night, striving together toward an elusive ideal, achieving the highest creative highs together. I murmured my agreement as an outside observer, but one with investment in the idea. I knew what she was talking about because I'd felt it in the room.\\n\\nSchneider divided Data Lords into two halves, The Digital World and Our Natural World, with the latter meant to acknowledge the parts of human experience still unmediated by technology. One piece on that portion of the album bears the title Braided Together, after a phrase in a Ted Kooser poem — and that idea of interwovenness, of how we support each other, hits different now.\\n\\nOver Thanksgiving, when the Maria Schneider Orchestra would traditionally have been in residency at the Jazz Standard, Schneider posted a two-hour video to the band's Facebook page, featuring footage from both the recording sessions and a recent engagement at the Jazz Standard. It concludes with the band gathering over a video-sharing service, with all the fondness and awkward pauses of a virtual family reunion. (For a few minutes they all just watch an old clip of the band's drummer, Johnathan Blake, appearing on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood at age 6 with his late father, violinist John Blake.)\\n\\nPrecisely an hour into the video, there's footage from the Jazz Standard of a piece Schneider titled Look Up. As on Data Lords, it begins with a brief solo by Kimbrough, unspooling impressionistic phrases in a major key. In her introduction, Schneider tells the audience that its title refers simply to the wonders above, which are easy to miss with a head buried in your phone.\\n\\nAs I consider all the ways my attention turned inward over the last year, and whatever transformation has been happening there, this feels like a plain, useful prompt. It's not enough to ruminate on the world we lost, or even the one we hope to rebuild. There's also the exhortation Schneider offers to the crowd that night, and by extension now to us, whatever our dawning resolutions: Don't forget to look up."}

Bean's outdoor gear — including its signature Bean Boots prized by campers and hipsters alike — is no longer guaranteed for life.\\n\\nIn a letter to customers Friday morning, the company said it has updated its return policy to give customers one year to return purchases, with a receipt. The previous lifetime guarantee, which enabled customers to return products years — or even decades — after purchase, has long been a selling point for the company.\\n\\nIncreasingly, a small, but growing number of customers has been interpreting our guarantee well beyond its original intent. Some view it as a lifetime product replacement program, expecting refunds for heavily worn products used over many years. Others seek refunds for products that have been purchased through third parties, such as at yard sales.'\\n\\nL.L. Bean says the policy update will affect only a small percentage of returns and pledged to keep its mission of selling high quality products that inspire and enable people to enjoy the outdoors. The company says if a product is defective, it will work with our customers to reach a fair solution even after a year.\\n\\nThe return policy on the site now reads:\\n\\nIf you are not 100% satisfied with one of our products, you may return it within one year of purchase for a refund. After one year, we will consider any items for return that are defective due to materials or craftsmanship.\\n\\nA Business Insider reporter put the policy to the test last year by returning four-year-old shoes with broken stitching. He recounts that the cashier immediately accepted the return and asked for no proof about when he purchased the shoes. Two days later, the brand-new shoes were waiting on my doorstep, Business Insider writes.\\n\\nAt the time, an L.L. Bean spokesperson told the site that the return policy was taken advantage of less than might be expected.\\n\\nOur guarantee is not a liability, but rather a customer service asset — an unacknowledged agreement between us and the customer, that always puts the customer first and relies on the goodwill of our customers to honor the original intent of the guarantee, spokesperson Mac McKeever told Business Insider.\\n\\nThe company traces its origins to 1911, when a Maine outdoorsman developed a hunting shoe with leather uppers and rubber bottoms. Its rugged products were designed with hunting and fishing in mind.\\n\\nIn recent years the company has taken steps to appeal to a hipper, less outdoorsy clientele. As Maine Public Radio reported, L.L. Bean has been looking to really create a new updated fit and style.\\n\\nThis American Life dug into L.L. Bean's legendary return policy — listen to it here."}

But when Utah lawmakers opened a new legislative session in late January, they began pushing through a bill to roll back the scope and impact of an expansion that voters approved by in a ballot measure.\\n\\nWe voted for this on Nov. 6. We were very clear about what we wanted, says Andrew Roberts, a spokesman for Utah Decides, the group that organized the Medicaid expansion referendum, known as Proposition 3.\\n\\nThe voter-approved measure would extend coverage to 150,000 uninsured people in the state.\\n\\nWe are frustrated, and I think Utahns are frustrated, Roberts says.\\n\\nHe's so frustrated that his group hired a billboard truck to drive in circles around the Capitol building and through the snowy streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Signs on the sides of the truck flash phrases in LED lights, including Support democracy. Support Utah's vote. A looping video advertisement urges residents to call lawmakers who don't respect the will of the people.\\n\\nAfter six years of talking about Medicaid expansion, voters approved the ballot measure on Nov. 6, with 53 percent in favor. But the issue erupted again when the legislative session started Jan. 28.\\n\\nSimilar legislative efforts to curtail expansion are also happening in Idaho, where voters passed a Medicaid expansion initiative in November. Sixty-one percent of voters were in favor. Idaho lawmakers are considering ways to scale that program back.\\n\\nIn politically and fiscally conservative Utah, legislators argue the 0.15 percent non-food sales tax that voters approved won't be enough to pay for Medicaid expansion. So they'll pass an expansion, but only a very limited one.\\n\\nVoters wanted Medicaid expansion and that's what we're doing, says Republican state Sen. Allen Christensen. But, he adds, the voters didn't fill in the proper blanks. We are filling in those blanks for them. They are not obligated to balance the budget. We are.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cory Dinter/KUER Cory Dinter/KUER\\n\\nChristensen is leading the rollback effort in Utah. His alternative proposal, SB 96, would cap the number of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid, add work requirements and lower the annual income limit. Prop. 3 supporters had wanted the coverage available for people who made up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year. But Christensen's bill would offer Medicaid coverage only to people who made less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 for an individual.\\n\\nMaking those changes would require the state of Utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of voters, I think voters have a right to be furious right now, says Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, another group that has supported Medicaid expansion.\\n\\nSlonaker says changing the scope of Prop. 3 would mean fewer people getting health coverage, and the state would receive less money from the federal government. He also fears it could make voters feel disillusioned.\\n\\nWhy would voters ever want to pursue ballot initiatives and direct democracy if the legislature's just going to repeal it anyway? Slonaker asks.\\n\\nWhile some Utah lawmakers, such as Christensen, describe being philosophically opposed to Medicaid expansion, much of the political debate in Utah is about how much expansion will cost, and whether the new sales tax will pay for it. Supporters point to the fiscal experience of other states.\\n\\nYou should think of Medicaid expansion as no different than if you said, 'Oh, hey, somebody's going to go open up a factory, says Bryce Ward, an economist at the University of Montana, in Missoula. And that factory is going to bring, in the case of Montana, $600 million of outside money into the state that we're going to pay to workers here.\\n\\nWard recently published a report on the economic impacts of Medicaid expansion in Montana during the first two years of that program. He says it brought in about $600 million dollars in new funds to the state per year. That money supported about 6,000 jobs, he adds, or about $350 million in additional income for residents.\\n\\nWard says states like his also can take advantage of savings, because Medicaid expansion makes providing health care to certain groups, like prisoners, more affordable. While states do have to pay 10 percent of the cost of expanded Medicaid (the federal government covers 90 percent — a more generous match than traditional Medicaid), the combination of savings and economic growth meant that, in the case of Montana, the program basically pays for itself, Ward says.\\n\\nThe benefits that people in Utah have is that people like me in other states have done the work trying to figure this out, he says. Or at least get some ballpark estimates of it.\\n\\nSo far, Utah lawmakers remain unconvinced by studies like Ward's. The bill to restrict Medicaid expansion is moving fast, and could reach the governor's desk as soon as next week.\\n\\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KUER and Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."}
{"original": "After A Fall At Baylor, Ken Starr Became A Fox Regular, And Then, A Trump Defender\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cooper Neill/Getty Images Cooper Neill/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 2:46 a.m. ET Sunday\\n\\nOn Friday, President Trump added former independent counsel Ken Starr to the legal team that will defend him in the Senate impeachment trial.\\n\\nStarr is best known for leading an investigation into President Bill Clinton's affair with a White House intern during the 1990s.\\n\\nThe investigation was aggressive, lengthy, and offered a window into Starr's approach to holding the powerful to account. But in the years that followed the Clinton impeachment, a different type of scandal provided another picture of Starr's approach.\\n\\nIn 2016, almost two decades after Starr investigated the Clinton scandal, Starr was fired from his job as president of Baylor University, accused of ignoring sexual assault issues on campus.\\n\\nIt seems very clear that he governed over a policy that was, at best, indifferent to what was happening to Baylor women, Jim Dunnam, a lawyer representing 15 women in an ongoing case against the university, told NPR.\\n\\nWhen Starr took over the presidency at Baylor University in 2010, he appeared to have quickly grasped the importance of athletics at the Division I school. As president, he oversaw the opening of the university's $250 million football stadium. Before some games, he even ran onto the football field and cheered alongside students.\\n\\nHowever, shortly after Starr's arrival on campus, Baylor athletics became marred by sexual assault allegations and convictions.\\n\\nAccording to a 2016 report from The Wall Street Journal, the sexual assault scandal that plagued Baylor during Starr's tenure included at least 17 women who had reported sexual or domestic assault involving 19 football players since 2011. The reports included four instances of alleged gang rapes, according to the Journal.\\n\\nConvictions soon followed. In 2014, former Baylor football player Tevin Elliott was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison on two counts of sexually assaulting a former Baylor student in 2012.\\n\\nWhen another football player was convicted of sexual assault the following year, Starr called for an internal inquiry into how the university handled the case. The internal inquiry led Starr to recommend that the university hire outside counsel to look into the school's response.\\n\\nA fundamental failure\\n\\nThe results of the inquiry were damning. According to a summary of the findings of the law firm Pepper Hamilton released by the university in 2016, the investigators discovered a fundamental failure by Baylor to implement Title IX, the federal law that polices sexual violence on campus, as well as the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\\n\\nThe report expanded on several ways the university fell short, finding:\\n\\nBaylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players. The choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the University. In certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to report sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of athletics.\\n\\nThe summary of the report didn't identify any of Baylor's top administrators by name, but stated that senior leadership had failed to support and engage with the school's Title IX functions, and that institutional failures at every level of Baylor's administration had impacted response to individual cases of alleged assault.\\n\\nStarr declined NPR's request to comment on this story, writing in an email that, for now, he's remaining silently on the media sidelines.\\n\\nBut in a 2018 interview with NPR, Starr said this about the Baylor scandal: Unfortunately — and this is going to sound like an apologia, but it is the absolute truth — never was it brought to my attention that there were these issues. And I focused on student safety from day one.\\n\\nSoon after the report was released, the school's athletics director resigned after being sanctioned and put on probation, and the head football coach was fired, along with other members of the athletics program. Starr was stripped of the presidency, and subsequently resigned from his faculty position.\\n\\nThe same year, a case was filed against Baylor alleging violations of Title IX and a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual assault. According to an early complaint filed in the case, reports of sexual assault to high-level, policy-setting employees at Baylor failed to result in change at the university.\\n\\nStarr was at the helm the entire period of time, said Dunnam, one of the plaintiff lawyers in the case, which remains ongoing.\\n\\nWhen asked how much he thinks Starr knew of the school's sexual assault problem, Dunnam pointed to a lesser-known 2014 report by the consulting firm Margolis Healy & Associates that was also commissioned by the university and obtained by the Waco Tribune-Herald in 2018.\\n\\nThe report outlined how administrators, including athletic department staff, had received little to no training regarding Title IX, and had failed to adequately communicate with and support students. One person the firm interviewed said, We have to stop being stupid. The Margolis Healy report was delivered to Baylor almost two years before Starr was ousted in 2016. Starr has claimed it as evidence of the university's commitment to addressing student safety.\\n\\nStill, the specifics of how Starr handled the scandal remain unknown. The 2016 Pepper Hamilton report was never released in full.\\n\\nBut that could change. Last March, a federal judge in Texas ordered the law firm to turn over records connected to its 2016 inquiry into Baylor requested by the plaintiffs.\\n\\nAccording to the firm's initial summary, it reviewed emails, cellphone data and documents from current and former Baylor employees, as well as interviews with more than 65 people, including witnesses in the president's office as part of its investigation. For now, says Dunnam, the case is still in discovery.\\n\\nAfter Baylor, Starr joined the Lanier Law Firm in 2018, and became a frequent commentator and defender of the president on Fox News. Those appearances have helped return Starr to the center of yet another presidential impeachment."}
{"original": "Exclusive: White House And Ivanka Trump Propose New Spending On Child Care\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIn the midst of a presidential budget proposal destined to generate controversy for its expected drastic spending cuts, White House senior adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump wants to have a conversation about increasing the availability and affordability of child care.\\n\\nNPR has learned that the 2020 White House budget set to be released Monday will call for increased spending on child care and propose an initiative to address shortages.\\n\\nPresidential budgets are policy statements, frequently ignored by Congress, and this one is no different (It has already been declared a nonstarter by Democrats.) So in a way, this is Ivanka Trump and the White House signaling that they want in on a debate already underway in the business world and in politics about this ever growing challenge.\\n\\nYou have care providers who are working at below poverty wages, you have parents who can't afford the care and you don't have a robust ecosystem of facilities because it's a low-margin business with high liability, said Ivanka Trump on the sidelines of a discussion she recently led at the White House with about more than a dozen people who specialize in child care. So, it's like just a fundamentally flawed system.\\n\\nNPR was invited to the West Wing listening session in late February and was given early details of the child care proposal from Ivanka Trump that is included in the president's 2020 budget.\\n\\nOne-time investment\\n\\nThe centerpiece is a proposed one-time investment of $1 billion to increase the supply of child care to underserved populations. States would apply for funding and could use it to encourage employers large and small to invest in child care or to support child care providers that operate during nontraditional work hours or that cater to parents who are enrolled in school.\\n\\nWe want to encourage innovation, said Ivanka Trump. We want to encourage the private sector to step up.\\n\\nTo get the money, states would have to establish targets for reducing unnecessary regulatory or other requirements that limit the supply or increase the cost of child care. A White House aide said this isn't meant to roll back regulations on child-to-caregiver ratios but rather to get rid of zoning requirements in some areas that don't allow child care centers in residential districts, for instance.\\n\\nIt would be implemented through the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which in the past two years saw its funding significantly boosted by Congress in spending bills ultimately signed by President Trump. A White House official, who declined to speak on the record because the budget is not yet public, said the president's 2020 budget proposal calls for spending $5.3 billion on the program, the same level that Congress set aside in 2019 and a big increase over what past Trump administration budgets asked for. The $1 billion one-time fund would come on top of that.\\n\\nIvanka Trump said, Continuing to make sure we fund the programs adequately is key, while also talking up the increase in the child tax credit included in the Republican tax law passed in late 2017.\\n\\nTrump greeted the researchers, child care providers and representatives of business groups in the Roosevelt Room before going around the table asking about challenges and soliciting ideas for solutions. She chimed in occasionally to amplify someone's point or to ask questions.\\n\\nHere are some of the challenges that Trump and the experts she met with identified in that White House meeting: The early years are critical for brain development but quality, safe, affordable child care is often hard to come by. There are mile-long waiting lists for care that, for many families, costs more than their housing. And yet, a lot of child care workers can't make ends meet.\\n\\nAs Trump talked about the challenges, she framed it in a way that Democrats have for years — not as a mom's problem or a families' problem but as an impediment to economic growth.\\n\\nEconomic strain\\n\\nChad Dunkley, CEO of New Horizon Academy, a child care provider, attended the listening session and has advocated for more child care funding on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nI think there's a growing bipartisan consensus that we have to do more to build the financial security of young families in this country, said Dunkley. They have to feel confident they can grow their families here, and if they don't, our economy is going to be in trouble.\\n\\nThat economic strain is already evident in low birthrates and stalled labor force participation, Dunkley said.\\n\\nThe White House was asked about proposed funding levels in the 2020 budget for Head Start, another major early childhood program, but that information was not forthcoming.\\n\\nPresident Trump included child care in his 2016 campaign, and as his re-election efforts ramp up, the White House has put a focus on selling the idea that he has kept his campaign promises. That said, this new proposal isn't remotely close to what Trump campaigned on.\\n\\nCampaign issue for Democrats\\n\\nIt comes as child care is already a 2020 campaign issue, with Democratic candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, rolling out child care-for-all plans.\\n\\nHow much you make at your job should not determine the quality of care your child gets. That's why for millions of families who need it, access to these child care options will be free, Warren said in a video announcing her plan.\\n\\nIn Congress there are child care bills from Democrats in both the House and the Senate designed to stimulate growth in child care availability, defray costs for families that can't afford it and pay providers a living wage. The price tags on these plans run tens of billions of dollars each year, vastly more than the White House proposal.\\n\\nThe White House official said these Democratic plans would cost unsustainable amounts of taxpayer dollars, adding that Ivanka Trump sees her role as an advocate for producing legislation that actually has a viable path forward.\\n\\nAsked if she could work with Ivanka Trump on child care, Sen. Patty Murray from Washington state, a leading Democrat on the issue, was polite.\\n\\nI'm excited that more people are aware of the barrier that child care is to working families in order to achieve their economic dreams and take care of their families, said Murray. So we welcome all ideas, but they have to be real ideas.\\n\\nThere's plenty of agreement on the problems but not yet on the solutions. Asked which members of Congress the Trump administration had reached out to on the issue, the White House official said simply that Ivanka Trump looks forward to working with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle."}
{"original": "Fearing Climate Change Policy Under Trump, STEM Group Works To Get Scientists Elected\\n\\nScientists across the country are planning to go to Washington — and take office. Shaughnessy Naughton is the founder of 314 Action a non profit that helps scientists run for office.\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nThere's been a lot of talk about how the election of Donald Trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. We're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the Trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. Some scientists are worried about President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who's criticized EPA rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office.\\n\\nOne such group is called 314 Action which aims to prepare doctors, scientists, engineers and mathematicians to get more involved in politics. Its founder is Shaughnessy Naughton, a business owner with a chemistry degree who ran for Congress in Pennsylvania, albeit unsuccessfully. I began our conversation by asking her how she came up with the name 314 Action.\\n\\nSHAUGHNESSY NAUGHTON: Three, one, four are the first three digits of pi which is used throughout the sciences, and part of why I founded this organization was one of my observations from when I ran for Congress, I was really surprised at the lack of people with scientific or technical backgrounds. And I think we all benefit by having diversity of experience in government. And so I founded 314 Action to unite the scientific community and to encourage them to go beyond the traditional role of advocacy and actually get involved in electoral politics.\\n\\nMARTIN: So I understand that you called 314 Action an Emily's List for scientists, and for people who don't know, Emily's List is a group that's been around for - what? - a couple of decades now that raises money for promising democratic women candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights. Are there similar baseline positions that must be adhered to for your group to support these candidates?\\n\\nNAUGHTON: Well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. At this point, we are only supporting Democratic candidates, and although we want to see more Republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team.\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, so I'm thinking about the fact that physicians are actually well-represented in the current administration and have been in Congress for some time. I'm thinking about President Trump's nominee for Health Secretary - Tom Price is a physician. Former Congressman Ron Paul was a physician. His son Rand Paul, the senator, was an ophthalmologist. All of them are conservatives, and I'm wondering why is that?\\n\\nNAUGHTON: Well, I think the nature of careers as, especially as independent practitioners for physicians, it does allow for greater flexibility and the ability to take time out of their career without being punished for it later. But what we are trying to do, although we include physicians in our umbrella group, we really want to bring people in from teaching, from research, from fields that are under-represented currently.\\n\\nMARTIN: Shaughnessy Naughton is a chemist, an entrepreneur, she's the founder of 314 Action. That's a group that aims to encourage scientists people from the STEM fields - science technology, engineering and math - to run for elective office. She was kind enough to join us from our member station WHYY in Philadelphia. Shaughnessy Naughton, thank you so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nNAUGHTON: Thank you, Michel.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Says His Mideast Peace Plan Provides A 'Realistic Two-State Solution'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Said Khatib/AFP via Getty Images Said Khatib/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 5:50 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump says his long-awaited Mideast peace plan unveiled Tuesday is a road map for a realistic two-state solution that envisions Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.\\n\\nHowever, the plan limits the sovereignty of a future Palestinian state. Israel would be in charge of maintaining security over the state of Palestine, which would be fully demilitarized. The proposal also allows Israel to declare sovereignty over certain areas of the occupied West Bank, including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley.\\n\\nTrump heralded the plan as a historic breakthrough, even though the Palestinian leadership, which severed relations with the U.S. administration as it took a series of pro-Israel moves, rejected it before the proposal was formally released.\\n\\nAfter 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they ever have, Trump said at a joint briefing at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides — a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security.\\n\\nThe U.S. plan has been in the making since the earliest days of Trump's administration, when the president assigned his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner the task of trying to forge the elusive deal.\\n\\nTrump lauded his own proposal as far more specific than other peace plans to date. He said it includes a detailed territorial map of the borders showing territorial compromises [Israel] is willing to make, adding that it marks the first time Israel has authorized the release of such information.\\n\\nHe also said the U.S. would open a new embassy in Eastern Jerusalem to the Palestinians.\\n\\nThe Trump administration believes that in addition to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, this plan could lead to a peace agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nBut Palestinians were outraged by the proposal. Opposition even appeared to unite longtime Palestinian political rivals the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas chaired an emergency meeting with Hamas, and called it a new phase of Palestinian dialogue and joint work, according to local media.\\n\\nTrump has described the plan as the deal of the century, but Abbas called it the smack of the century, saying it was an unacceptable attempt to liquidate the Palestinian issue.\\n\\nHamas leader Ismael Haniyeh said in a statement that the new plot against Palestine is doomed to failure and Palestine will vanquish the colonizers at the end.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nIn announcing the plan alongside Trump, with whom he has close ties, Netanyahu said Tuesday that I've agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan. It's a great plan for Israel. It's a great plan for peace.\\n\\nOn Monday, Trump met separately with Netanyahu and with Benny Gantz, the leader of Israel's Blue and White political alliance, Netanyahu's principal political opponent. Gantz also has expressed his approval of the plan.\\n\\nTrump said at the time that the Palestinians probably won't want [the plan] initially, but I think in the end they're going to want it.\\n\\nSo, we'll see what happens, he added. Without them, we don't do a deal. And that's OK.\\n\\nAfter Trump ordered the U.S. Embassy moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in December 2017, the Palestinians largely broke off relations with the White House. The move, however, proved extremely popular with Israelis.\\n\\nIn June, the White House released the first half of its peace proposal: a $50 billion investment plan billed as a new vision for the Palestinian territories. The U.S. made the creation of the investment fund contingent upon Palestinian acceptance of the second, political part of the peace plan, released Tuesday.\\n\\nSome analysts questioned the merits of the plan. While Trump claims a revolutionary approach to the peace process, this plan actually recycles past failed efforts: it places Palestinians on probation while they prove their worthiness of statehood, using conditions that are malleable and ill-defined; it seeks to induce Palestinian capitulation through economic largesse; and it removes the onus on Israel to make any concessions until Palestinians declare their full surrender, Tareq Baconi, Israel/Palestine analyst for International Crisis Group, said in a statement.\\n\\nThe proposal comes at a politically fraught moment for both Trump and Netanyahu. Trump is currently on trial in the Senate after he was impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Netanyahu was formally indicted Tuesday on criminal corruption charges.\\n\\nIsrael's prime minister is trying to make this major diplomatic decision, even though his government is a temporary government, in part to shore up support for him domestically as someone who can champion Israel in the international arena, Natan Sachs of the Center for Middle East Policy at The Brookings Institution tells NPR.\\n\\nSachs also notes that when U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were facing impeachment, they pushed forward with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe plan includes proposals on several core issues that have been major obstacles to progress in previous attempts to forge a comprehensive peace. They include:\\n\\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank\\n\\nIn April, Netanyahu pledged to annex West Bank settlements in a move aimed at galvanizing support among his right-wing voter base. He later extended that pledge to include annexation of the Jordan Valley, where Palestinians are seeking an independent state. Late last year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. does not view settlements as a violation of international law, upending the decades-old U.S. policy that settlements are an obstacle to peace.\\n\\nTrump said that no Israelis or Palestinians would be uprooted from their homes. According to the plan, Israeli enclaves, or settlements, located inside contiguous Palestinian territory will become part of the State of Israel and be connected through an effective transportation system. A map included in the plan shows 15 such enclaves.\\n\\nThe proposal does not stick to Israel's pre-1967 borders and mutually-agreed-on territory swaps as a starting point for peace negotiations — which had been U.S. policy under President Barack Obama and which Netanyahu described as indefensible. Instead, the plan contemplates a Palestinian state that encompasses territory reasonably comparable in size to the territory of the West Bank and Gaza pre-1967.\\n\\nIsrael would annex the entire Jordan Valley, according to the plan. Areas in a future Palestinian state would include parts of the West Bank, connected to the Gaza Strip through a tunnel. It also would include two areas of desert, connected by a thin passage, near Israel's border with Egypt.\\n\\nIsrael would not need to wait until before taking control of areas allocated to it under the plan, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a call to reporters.\\n\\nPalestinian statehood\\n\\nPalestinians have long sought their own state, and much of the international community has supported that desire. In 2002, then-President George W. Bush called for a Palestinian state as part of his Road Map for Peace. In 2009, Netanyahu supported a demilitarized Palestinian state, but by 2015, he had reversed course, declaring his own policy null and void.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he told Abbas in a letter that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years, in which Palestinians may deliberate and study the deal and achieve the criteria for statehood.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, the U.S. and Israel would judge whether Palestinians have met that criteria.\\n\\nThose include implementing a governing system that protects certain rights; establishing transparent, independent, and credit-worth financial institutions; ending all programs that promote hate; achieving civilian and law enforcement control over all of its territory; and demilitarizing its population.\\n\\nIt adds that sovereignty is an amorphous concept that has evolved over time.\\n\\nSecurity Arrangements\\n\\nThe limits that the plan would place on Palestinian sovereignty are particularly clear when it comes to security.\\n\\nIsrael will have the overriding security responsibility and control over the entire territory, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, Friedman told reporters.\\n\\nEven so, the plan expresses the aspiration that the Palestinians will be responsible for as much of their internal security as possible.\\n\\nIt also calls for a Palestinian state to be fully demilitarized. And Israel would have the power to expand its internal security role at any time if it deems the Palestinians are not meeting specific criteria, such as possessing certain weapons.\\n\\nJerusalem\\n\\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians view the disputed city of Jerusalem as their capital. When the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, it sparked huge protests by Palestinians.\\n\\nUnder the Trump administration's plan, Jerusalem would remain united and would be the capital of Israel. We believe that returning to a divided Jerusalem, and in particular having two separate security forces in one of the most sensitive areas on earth, would be a grave mistake, the proposal states.\\n\\nIt envisions the capital of a Palestinian state in portions of East Jerusalem located beyond existing walls, which Israel says it needs for security, that cut it off from the heart of the city. The plan suggests naming it Al Quds, the Arabic word for Jerusalem.\\n\\nJerusalem is home to major holy sites for Muslims, Jews and Christians. The status quo for these sites would be preserved, including Jordan's role as custodian of the Muslim sites.\\n\\nPalestinian Right of Return\\n\\nSome 750,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. More than seven decades later, Israel denies first-generation Palestinian displaced persons and their descendants the right to return to communities from which they had been expelled or had abandoned.\\n\\nUnder the plan, there shall be no right of return by, or absorption of, any Palestinian refugee into the State of Israel. Rather, the refugees would be absorbed into a Palestinian state or integrated into their current host countries. Additionally, up to 50,000 Palestinians may be accepted by Organization of Islamic Cooperation member countries.\\n\\nThe proposal also will endeavor to raise a fund to provide some compensation to Palestinian refugees, without specifying where the money might come from."}
{"original": "Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Secretary Of State Mike Pompeo\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nIn an interview on Friday with All Things Considered co-host Mary Louise Kelly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took questions about U.S. policy in Iran and about the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\\n\\nMary Louise Kelly: Secretary of State, good to see you.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo: Good to be with you. Thanks for having me on the show.\\n\\nListen: Mary Louise Kelly Interviews Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Listen · 11:09 11:09\\n\\nLet's start with Iran. What is the plan? And on diplomacy, specifically, is there any serious initiative to reopen diplomacy with Iran?\\n\\nSo we've been engaged in deep diplomatic efforts since the first day of the Trump administration. We've built out a coalition that is working together — Gulf states, Israel, many European countries — to deliver on the three central outcomes that we're looking for.\\n\\nBut in terms of U.S. engagement with Iran, is there any talks underway, any plan for talks?\\n\\nYou know, we never talk about private conversations that are taking place, but the diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously successful. We built out a significant coalition that has put pressure on the Iranian regime to do what we've asked: to cease its processing of uranium, reprocessing of plutonium, to stop its missile program and the development of its missile program. President Trump made clear they're not going to have a nuclear program that is capable of delivering these weapons around the world. And then finally, working to convince them that their model, this proxy model that they've used to conduct terror campaigns, assassinations in Europe, assassination attempt right here in Washington, D.C., is not tolerable.\\n\\nYou use the word pressure. This is the maximum pressure campaign that President Trump put into place a year and a half ago when he pulled out of the nuclear deal. But in that year and a half, Iran has behaved more provocatively, not less. So is maximum pressure working?\\n\\nAbsolutely working. To put it in context, this is 40 years. When you say worse, they held American hostages in our embassy in Tehran. They had our sailors kneeling. The previous administration gave them billions and billions of dollars to underwrite the very actions that they're taking today. When we came into office, it took a lot of work to fundamentally reshape the diplomatic, military and economic landscape. So it didn't happen instantaneously, but we made an enormous amount of progress in delivering —\\n\\nBut in the last year, they have targeted tankers in the Gulf. They have shot down a U.S. drone, and they have attacked Saudi oil facilities. Is that the desired outcome?\\n\\nNo, of course not. Of course, we don't want them to do those things. And we've raised the cost for doing this. The response in the previous administration when they undertook those actions was to reward them — to reward them, to give them billions of billions of dollars to allow countries to trade with them, to allow them to do all the things that you're seeing today, the ramifications, the tail, the end result of what the previous administration is the activity that we're seeing today. The money that underwrote Hezbollah, that underwrites Hamas, that underwrites Shia militias in Iraq is a direct result of the resources that were provided to them for the eight years prior to us coming into office. We are turning this around. We have reduced resources. We've seen it. They have fewer dollars available. This is beginning to place real choices in front of the Iranian regime. And you can see it, too. You can see in the protests inside of Iran. You can see the Iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. All the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the American people are coming to fruition as a direct result of President Trump's strategy.\\n\\nPresident Trump's strategy has included pulling out of the nuclear deal. Since the president came to office, Iran has moved closer to a nuclear weapons capability. They are closer today than they were when he took office. They are spinning more centrifuges. They are stockpiling more enriched uranium. If the plan is to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, how do you do that when they're not abiding by the limits of the old deal and there's no new deal in sight?\\n\\nYou're picking the wrong moment to start your analysis. This is the fundamental flaw of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] itself.\\n\\nI'm picking the moment [crosstalk] when the president pulled out of the nuclear deal, and since then, they are closer to having a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nThis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. And the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program.\\n\\nIt was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off. It's been realistic. We accept the facts on the ground as they are. This is a regime that lied to get into that nuclear deal. You can see that now. And what's going on at the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in Turquzabad where we now know that they lied about the scope of their program. These are important, Mary Louise. These are important items. You can't talk about the Iranian nuclear program without acknowledging the facts of what this regime has been up to. They stored documents. They kept technology in place. They dispersed it as a result of the JCPOA. They didn't have it in a central research agency, but they continued to develop their program and this administration is determined to prevent them from getting that weapon. Not now, not a year from now and not 10 years from now.\\n\\nBut again, you say you're determined to prevent them. How do you stop them? I was in Tehran two weeks ago. I sat down with your counterpart there, Javad Zarif, and he told me, quote, All limits on our centrifuge program are now suspended.\\n\\nYeah. He's blustering. Look, the truth of the matter is this is a regime that's never --\\n\\nDo you have evidence that he's blustering?\\n\\nThis is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today. One has to confront so many elements that challenge the central thesis of the theocracy and the revolutionary nature of this regime. And you can see it in protests, not just in Tehran. And you should know when you traveled there, I'm guessing you weren't permitted to travel freely. I'm guessing that you didn't get a chance to go out into these places where the life of the Iranian people, these are people who are suffering. Qassem Soleimani, who we removed from the battlefield, killed hundreds of Iranians, and the Iranian people know that. And it's been our strategy that has delivered this message of freedom for the Iranian people.\\n\\nBut my question again, how do you stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?\\n\\nWe'll stop them.\\n\\nHow? Sanctions?\\n\\nWe'll stop them.\\n\\nThe president made very clear. The opening sentence in his remarks said that we will never permit Iran to have a nuclear weapon. The coalition that we've built out, the economic, military and diplomatic deterrence that we have put in place will deliver that outcome. It's important [crosstalk] because this will protect the American people.\\n\\nIs there any new deal being developed? A new nuclear deal, something that would rein in Iran, something that they would agree to.\\n\\nThe Iranian leadership will have to make the decision about what its behavior is going to be.\\n\\nChange of subject. Ukraine. Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?\\n\\nYou know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration. I'm proud of the work we've done. This administration delivered the capability for the Ukrainians to defend themselves. President Obama showed up with MREs (meals ready to eat.) We showed up with Javelin missiles. The previous administration did nothing to take down corruption in Ukraine. We're working hard on that. We're going to continue to do it.\\n\\nI confirmed with your staff [crosstalk] last night that I would talk about Iran and Ukraine.\\n\\nI just don't have anything else to say about that this morning.\\n\\nI just want to give you another opportunity to answer this, because as you know, people who work for you in your department, people who have resigned from this department under your leadership, saying you should stand up for the diplomats who work here. [crosstalk]\\n\\nI don't know who these unnamed sources are you're referring to. I can tell you this, when I talked to my team here --\\n\\nThese are not unnamed sources. [crosstalk] This is your senior adviser Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer with four decades experience, who testified under oath that he resigned in part due to the failure of the State Department to offer support to Foreign Service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine.\\n\\nI'm not going to comment on things that Mr. McKinley may have said. I'll say only this. I have defended every State Department official. We've built a great team. The team that works here is doing amazing work around the world.\\n\\nSir, respectfully [crosstalk] where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch?\\n\\nI've defended every single person on this team. I've done what's right for every single person on this team. [crosstalk]\\n\\nCan you point me toward your remarks where you have defended Marie Yovanovitch?\\n\\nI've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.\\n\\nOne further question on this.\\n\\nI'm not going to — I appreciate that. I appreciate that you want to continue to talk about this. I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran.\\n\\nAnd you appreciate [crosstalk] that the American public wants to know as a shadow foreign policy, as a back channel policy on Ukraine was being developed, did you try to block it?\\n\\nThe Ukraine policy has been run from the Department of State for the entire time that I have been here, and our policy was very clear.\\n\\nMarie Yovanovitch [crosstalk] testified under oath that Ukraine policy was hijacked.\\n\\nI've been clear about that. I know exactly what we were doing. I know precisely what the direction that the State Department gave to our officials around the world about how to manage our Ukraine policy.\\n\\n[Katie Martin, deputy assistant secretary, bureau of global public affairs at the State Department: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.]\\n\\nSecretary, thank you. Thank you."}
{"original": "Some Employers Are Rethinking Telework, Citing A Need For Better Collaboration\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dean Mitchell/Getty Images/iStock Dean Mitchell/Getty Images/iStock\\n\\nThe speed of digital technology has allowed workers to be mobile and flexible, and more employers continue to embrace remote work policies.\\n\\nBut it has also created demand for continuous updates and real-time collaboration. And that change has driven some companies — including IBM, Best Buy and Yahoo — to recall some of their remote workforces back into the office.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, IBM was one of the pioneers of telework, and over time, 20 percent of its employees worked remotely. Last year, it decided to recall some remote-work employees, a move that seemed to go against decades of policies aimed at supporting telework.\\n\\nDiane Gherson, senior vice president of human resources for IBM, says that is not the case. The shift in work policy affects about 2 percent of its 380,000 workers, she says, and reflects changing workplace demands.\\n\\nMillennial employees say they want to work with and learn from their older peers, and IBM's own employee surveys showed those who worked remotely were less engaged or motivated.\\n\\nBut most importantly, Gherson says, there has been a shift in how work itself gets done: This is a real tidal wave, and that is the need for continuous innovation.\\n\\nGherson says customers expect speedy fixes and updates. To achieve that, software developers started working together in rooms without walls, so they could talk through changes in real time.\\n\\nIBM isn't alone; Reddit and Bank of America, among others, have also recalled some remote-work employees. Gherson says employers in many industries, not just in software, are seeing the same shift.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nIt's bleeding into other forms of work — so you're seeing that in marketing, as an example, where you see campaigns that are continuously getting feedback from the market on an hourly basis, she says.\\n\\nRobert Martin, a software consultant and early advocate of what is known as the agile work method, says collocation is a key part of collaboration.\\n\\nThe collaborative nature of being agile means that people need to be close to each other, they need to be in the same room. Because we're making many rapid changes in sequence, we have to be able to communicate those changes quickly, he says.\\n\\nMartin was among 17 software developers who, in 2001, created and signed a document called the Agile Manifesto. The simple premise was that building software needs to take into account the very nature of the product — incorporating and welcoming change at every stage.\\n\\nThe word 'software' means, you know, flexible product, Martin says.\\n\\nHe and his fellow developers didn't think the manifesto would gain traction, but they posted it online and tens of thousands of engineers signed the document. Agile became a movement that other industries modeled.\\n\\nOf course, not everyone thinks remote work hurts collaboration. In fact, overall, telework continues to increase. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 40 percent of employers allow employees to regularly work from home.\\n\\nJay Friedman, chief operating officer for the Goodway Group, a digital marketing firm, says working from home is important to his company; only a handful of its workers on any given day head into the office.\\n\\nWe found that the talent was not necessarily all in Philadelphia, where headquarters is, or all in Dallas, where I am, he says.\\n\\nFriedman says some things are challenging, like having to terminate an employee over video conference. But overall, he says, the company's setup actually improved communication and coordination.\\n\\nBeing remote forced us to document more — so document decisions, document learning, training, etc. — and that actually reduced the amount of time and back-and-forth, keeping everyone on the same page and on task, Friedman says."}
{"original": "Pretty Girls Make (Higher) Grades\\n\\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\\n\\nRing, ring.\\n\\nHello?\\n\\nIt's reality calling. People are shallow, and life isn't fair.\\n\\nIn a new paper, a pair of researchers looked at the student records of tens of thousands of students at their university. They compared the students' class grades to ratings of their physical attractiveness, as judged by outside observers from their student ID card photographs.\\n\\nThe researchers found that the women judged as least attractive earned significantly lower grades, after controlling for their ACT scores. The best-looking women earned higher grades. And male professors were more likely than female professors to give better-looking women higher grades.\\n\\nBut here's what the study's lead author, Rey Hernández-Julián, calls the key finding: When these same exact students took online courses, where appearance is not an issue, the benefits of being pretty all but disappeared.\\n\\nThe main results in our paper were not about whether there is a return to appearance, but whether it would be smaller in online environments, where the student is not seen, he told NPR Ed.\\n\\nThe study by Hernández-Julián and Christina Peters, both professors of economics, took place at Metropolitan State University of Denver, a broad-access university with a diverse student population.\\n\\nA large body of social-science research already supports the advantages of being really, really good-looking.\\n\\nBetter-looking people tend to make more money. They are more liked and trusted by others. They marry other good-looking people who are also better educated than average.\\n\\nA classic study from the 1970s showed this effect holds true in academic settings as well. Given identical course transcripts, teachers judged prospective students to be more intelligent if they appeared more attractive in a photograph.\\n\\nRachel Gordon, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has published papers with similar conclusions to this latest one — although her work has shown that better-looking men, as well as women, also receive a grade premium. That wasn't the case in the Denver study.\\n\\nGordon calls this idea of comparing the same students' performance in both online and in-person courses an interesting and clever design.\\n\\nPrevious studies left unclear whether people are reacting to some relevant quality that goes along with looks, or merely looks alone. Maybe students are rated unattractive because they are ill or depressed, which also tends to hurt their course performance. Or maybe good-looking students have more confidence and are more outgoing because they're good-looking, and that leads to better performance.\\n\\nBut if that's the case, why don't we see the same effects in online courses?\\n\\nHernández-Julián is the first to point out that the overall variation in grades on the basis of looks is small. Math class is not modeling school.\\n\\nBut, he says, giving all students a chance to compete academically in an arena where looks don't matter might allow more of them to shine."}

These incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nSeveral videos of supporters of President Trump chanting, shouting and berating fellow passengers including members of Congress have gone viral. In one, on an American Airlines flight from Texas to Washington, D.C., passengers shout at flight attendants while someone projects a pro-Trump image on the airplane cabin ceiling. In another, Trump supporters heckle Utah Sen. Mitt Romney with chants of traitor, on a flight from Salt Lake City to the nation's capital.\\n\\nRep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., told the Chicago Sun-Times that some passengers on his United flight back home to Chicago last Thursday threatened violence.\\n\\nThey were beyond abusive to the flight attendants, crew... one of the most abusive of these idiots had to be restrained. He was charging one of the flight attendants, Quigley said. I was afraid for the life of the flight attendant. He called her a Communist and then the c-word.\\n\\nBecause of those incidents, airports, airlines, the TSA, DHS and other federal law enforcement agencies had been ramping up security measures in preparation for the possibility of more protesters going to Washington in advance of next week's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nFAA Administrator Stephen Dickson's order says the agency will no longer issue warnings to passengers refusing to wear masks or acting in a belligerent or threatening manner. Instead, the agency will pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens, intimidates, or interferes with airline crew members. Penalties could include fines up to $35,000 and jail time.\\n\\nFlying is the safest mode of transportation and I signed this order to keep it that way, Administrator Dickson said in a news release.\\n\\nAirlines and their employees support the stricter enforcement action.\\n\\nFirst strike and you're out, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, in a statement. We applaud FAA Administrator Dickson for taking this clear stand for our safety and security. This will help serve as a deterrent to unruly passengers who had been bucking the rules of aviation safety. We continue to work with our airlines, the FAA, the TSA and law enforcement to keep our skies safe.\\n\\nIn a tweet, the industry group Airlines for America said, The safety and security of passengers and employees is the top priority of the U.S. airline industry, and we welcome the @FAANews' order to implement a more stringent policy regarding unruly passenger behavior.\\n\\nThe order is a bit of a reversal for Dickson and the FAA, which since March has resisted industry and airline employee union calls for a federal mask mandate on planes. This isn't a mask mandate but is a strong crackdown on passengers who violate the airlines' own policies requiring passengers to wear masks or face coverings."}
{"original": "Former Egyptian Foreign Minister Reacts To Trump Administration's Policy Approach\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nEarlier on his trip, Mike Pompeo was in Cairo, where he said in a speech that the U.S. is committed to defeating ISIS. The very next day, the Pentagon announced it was beginning a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, troops that had been fighting ISIS. This is just the latest in a string of mixed messages coming from this administration on foreign policy, from Syria to North Korea to Afghanistan to Iran.\\n\\nWe wanted to get a diplomat's perspective on how to handle inconsistencies from a superpower. And so we've turned to Nabil Fahmy. He is a former Egyptian foreign minister and was ambassador to the United States from 1999 to 2008. Ambassador Fahmy joins us now from Cairo. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nNABIL FAHMY: Thank you very much. I'm always happy to be on the show.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Ambassador, let me ask you first - you were in the audience for Secretary Pompeo's speech - your reaction.\\n\\nFAHMY: Well, we were all there keenly interested to understand what would happen next. I think Secretary Pompeo was clear in the U.S. strong position on dealing with violent extremism. He was clear rhetorically, although it wasn't actually clear how much support would actually provided literally because in the same speech he also said, we're going to withdraw from Syria, and we wanted more countries in the region to carry a larger part of responsibility. So a little bit more detail would have been useful. I was also, frankly - and I'm going to be very honest with you - as much as I found his talk about extremism strong, I found his almost lack of any reference to the Arab-Israeli peace process quite disappointing, frankly.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the criticisms has been that no one seems to know who actually speaks for the president and that there are these competing foreign policy priorities. What have you been hearing in the region about how they are tackling that? Because on the one hand, policy seems to be enacted by the president through a tweet. And on the other hand, his emissaries seem to be giving a different kind of message.\\n\\nFAHMY: There's always competition between the heavyweights in any administration on policy issues. What's different now is it's not whether it's the NSC or the State Department or the Defense Department or the Congress. It's actually - you're not actually sure what to do because you're watching each one of these units occasionally trying to pull back the president from positions he has announced. It's beyond competition, and it goes all the way up to the top. To be fair to President Trump, he was elected as a nontraditional president, and he seems to insist on acting that way.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Sure. But when we're dealing with sensitive issues in the Middle East - as you know, it's a region with a lot of difficulties, a lot of conflicts - do you think it's helpful? I mean, some people have described his foreign policy in the Middle East at the moment as extremely chaotic.\\n\\nFAHMY: Well, I was about to add that while he's a nontraditional president, when you're dealing with the responsibilities of president, there are complicated, sensitive issues and implications to anything you say or anything you do. And it is very important for foreign parties to be able to assess what your position will be before you speak and after you speak. So the lack of a clear direction is a bit difficult to handle.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You obviously have discussions with people around the region who engage with the United States and the American administration. What would you say the general sense is at this moment if you had to characterize it in a few words?\\n\\nFAHMY: Well, depending on the issue. On the issue of extremism, people feel, OK, there's a stronger voice. On the issue of will that voice translate into actual concrete measures? - the turnover in Washington, the different voices in Washington raise questions about the sensibility and the credibility of those statements. Some people are alarmed but not worried because they think it's talk rather than content. And others are happy to hear the talk but are not yet sure that the talk will be translated into concrete action.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Nabil Fahmy is the dean of the School of Global Affairs at The American University in Cairo. And he is a former ambassador of Egypt to the United States. Thank you so much.\\n\\nFAHMY: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump Administration Will Let More Doctors Prescribe Drug To Fight Opioid Addiction\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Trump administration introduced new addiction treatment guidelines Thursday that give physicians more flexibility to prescribe a drug to patients struggling with opioid addiction.\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is eliminating the requirement that physicians obtain a special federal waiver in order to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication to treat opioid use disorder. Previously, doctors had to take an eight-hour course to receive the license, called the X-waiver.\\n\\nThe obstacle discouraged doctors from pursing buprenorphine as an addiction treatment for patients, despite evidence it was highly effective in preventing a relapse, advocates for the change have long said.\\n\\nThe medical evidence is clear: access to medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine that can be prescribed in office-based settings, is the gold standard for treating individuals suffering from opioid use disorder, said Adm. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for HHS, said in a statement. Removing some of the certification requirements for an X-waiver for physicians is a step toward providing more people struggling with this chronic disease access to medication assisted treatment.\\n\\nThe administration's move comes at a time when the U.S. is again facing record levels of drug overdose deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nMore than 83,000 people died of drug overdoses in the U.S. in the 12 months ending in June 2020, the CDC said. It's the highest number ever recorded in a one-year period, and a more than 21% increase compared to the previous year. While the category include all drug overdose deaths, the CDC says the increase is largely driven by synthetic opioids.\\n\\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians, the national medical society representing emergency medicine, applauded HHS's new guidance.\\n\\nAs emergency physicians, we see every day the devastating effects that the opioid crisis has had on the communities we serve—a crisis that has unfortunately only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mark Rosenberg, president of ACEP, said in a statement Thursday. Buprenorphine is the most important medication in our arsenal for treating opioid use disorder, which is currently one of the most lethal diseases for Americans.\\n\\nThe American Medical Association also praised the move, saying it will allow earlier intervention by doctors treating patients suffering addiction.\\n\\nWith this change, office-based physicians and physician-led teams working with patients to manage their other medical conditions can also treat them for their opioid use disorder, Dr. Patrice Harris, who heads the AMA's opioid task force, said in a statement.\\n\\nHarris also said allowing doctors to treat opioid addiction as they treat other medical conditions, without additional regulatory hurdles, will reduce the stigma that has often shaped the healthcare response to substance use disorders.\\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, doctors who possess a Drug Enforcement Administration registration will still be limited to treating no more than 30 in-state patients with buprenorphine for addiction treatment at any one time. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants will still need to apply for separate waivers to prescribe buprenorphine.\\n\\nThe guidelines are not considered a new law or federal regulation, making it very easy for the President-elect Joe Biden administration to walk back this policy if so desired.\\n\\nGiroir told Stat News that he thinks that scenario is unlikely, saying, I doubt it seriously."}
{"original": "Corporate Ethics In The Era Of Millennials\\n\\nEnlarge this image Getty Images Getty Images\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility has been added to the growing list of demands that investors, customers and employees present to companies.\\n\\nIn 2015, 81 percent of Fortune 500 companies published sustainability reports, up from 20 percent in 2011, according to a report released by the Governance & Accountability Institute in June. Companies are publicizing their ethical standards and responsibility efforts, and consumers are punishing companies that appear to fall short. Even as headlines proclaim greed is back, companies are investing time and resources into instituting more ethical practices.\\n\\nWhy is there such dissonance?\\n\\nAs is so often the case these days, businesses are taking cues from millennials. This generation (currently 18-35 years old) represents more than a quarter of the U.S. workforce — and this amount is expected to grow to over 50 percent by 2020. They will account for a third of retail sales in the same year. Businesses not thinking about how to interact with this generation are in serious trouble.\\n\\nSo how do millennials think about corporate social responsibility — or CSR?\\n\\nA 2014 Nielsen survey showed that millennials are significantly more responsive to CSR in both consumption as well as employment decisions. Of those surveyed who would pay a premium for sustainable products, verify packaging and choose a company with a higher CSR reputation as employer, about half were millennials. These millennials are choosing to spend their resources — be it time or money — on organizations that appear to represent a set of values.\\n\\nWith their significant buying power, millennials are placing huge demands on companies to respond with genuine CSR strategies.\\n\\nWhere can companies start in building out this strategy?\\n\\nAs millennials look for companies that focus on a triple bottom line (people, planet, profit), companies are looking to millennials for guidance. CSR actions should align with a company's values, brand proposition and business model but, at the same time, the company must listen and respond to its constituents.\\n\\nA key element for any successful CSR strategy is corporate communication. In the early days of CSR, corporations relied heavily on traditional media, delivering their message through advertising. Many did not institutionalize CSR as a separate business activity, relying on the marketing and public relations functions instead. Millennials, however, are far less responsive to press and TV ads and must be engaged differently. In scientific terms, their BS meters are very finely tuned. As so-called digital natives, this generation looks to social media to both consume and influence information and opinions. Peers are a trusted source; the official company flack is not.\\n\\nWhat's more, as opposed to traditional advertising, which is unidirectional, social media is a more delicate instrument where companies receive real-time feedback from their audience. Millennials expect to have their opinions listened and responded to, meaning that companies need to engage in more two-way conversations with their constituents. Establishing a communication strategy that is both consistent and practically nuanced to respond to changes in the environment is a difficult but necessary process for companies to go through.\\n\\nOverall, millennials are more demanding, more in touch and more skeptical. Brushing these off as cynicism is too simplistic. It puts the onus on organizations to show that they are not simply paying lip service to CSR, as consumers will sniff out and publicize anything that smells of hypocrisy. What's more, it has resulted in companies adapting to — or at least learning valuable lessons about — being more responsible entities.\\n\\nA recent example is Perdue Farms, one of America's largest poultry companies. In response to the growing demand, particularly from millennials, for cruelty-free meat, Perdue is changing its chicken breeding operations. Working alongside the Humane Society, Perdue has made massive changes to its farming processes, including reducing the use of antibiotics, providing more natural light and changing the way animals are slaughtered. Jim Perdue, chairman of Perdue Farms, has said that increased sales should compensate for the increased costs. He is confident that by going along with what Perdue's customers want, the company will be successful. This way of conducting CSR is a direct response to what consumers saw as a problem.\\n\\nA proactive approach involves building CSR into the culture of a company, something that many millennials look for as both employees and consumers. This approach can and should also add to the bottom line. Scott Moorehead, CEO of TCC, one of Verizon's largest retailers, said: The commoditization of wireless retail stores meant we needed to do more to differentiate ourselves in order to grow a loyal customer and employee base. With millennials accounting for 85 percent of its workforce, TCC started the Culture of Good program to engage its employees. Among other things, employees are allowed 16 hours per year of paid time off to devote to volunteer efforts. In 2015, the company donated $1.2 million to employee-led charity efforts. Such a policy fits well with two of the major requests from millennials: empowerment and the ability to affect local communities. The company says the result has been higher employee retention and satisfaction, as well as an increase in customers.\\n\\nTCC and Perdue were successful in different ways in responding to millennials' need for CSR efforts. Both as consumers and as employees, millennials want more from companies. On the company's side, CSR efforts should not be undertaken simply to be the good guys. In keeping faith with investors and creditors, these efforts should be genuinely beneficial to the organization. Not all efforts to implement CSR strategies have been successful in this. American Apparel learned that even the best of intentions in the realm of CSR could be derailed by simple economics.\\n\\nCSR is arguably at the very core of American Apparel's business model. The company produces its products in the U.S. and offers competitive pay and benefits. Studies of millennials' preference for buying local indicate that such a sweatshop-free model should be attractive and successful in commanding a premium. Faced with the reality of the world after the Great Recession and stuck with its ethical sourcing strategy, though, American Apparel wasn't able to cut costs as aggressively as competitors did and has failed to make a profit since 2009. The company has also heavily relied on a sex sells approach to marketing, something that often overshadowed any ethical positioning the company tried to assume.\\n\\nOther companies have stumbled into unfortunate CSR debacles. Starbucks began a well-intentioned but badly executed social media conversation about race, privilege and gentrification with its #RaceTogether campaign. Volkswagen is reeling from a 40 percent loss in share price and $15 billion in regulatory fines after its public commitment to sustainability was shown to be a cover for some truly bad behavior. The list of companies goes on. But we still argue that attempts at quality CSR are a vital component of a successful business strategy.\\n\\nOrganizations need to appreciate the degree to which the latest generation joining the workforce is making employment and consumption decisions based on CSR efforts. For a CSR strategy to be successful it needs to be authentic, in line with the brand image and attentive to what the public demands.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, Milton Friedman argued strongly — even convincingly — against CSR, considering it a form of taxation exercised on shareholders, consumers or employees by managers who had no legitimacy to do so. This argument relies on the premise that CSR initiatives imply negative net contributions to the bottom line. If we consider, instead, that well-executed CSR strategies lead to customer acquisition, increased sales, employee satisfaction, better teamwork, higher productivity, while lack of CSR can lead to disaster, Friedman's argument fails miserably today. The rise of the millennials as a powerful economic force increasingly exposes the fallacy of Friedman's argument.\\n\\nThe think pieces about the millennials have been written, dissected and rewritten. Although each generation bemoans the faults of the following ones, perhaps it's time we give millennials credit where credit is due: They are forcing business to do good while doing well. Companies need to rise to this challenge quickly or risk becoming an anachronism.\\n\\nPaul A. Argenti is professor of corporate communication at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.

{"original": "Immigration Policy Experts Weigh In On Biden Challenges Ahead\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nAll this weekend, we are reviewing some of the challenges that the incoming Biden administration will face, and now we want to turn to immigration. Curtailing immigration, both legal and illegal, was a top goal for President Trump. And it's one of the issues President-elect Joe Biden has promised to address on his very first day in office by sending an immigration reform bill to Congress - that according to a memo issued this weekend by the incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain. It's widely reported that the bill will seek to provide a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people who are currently in the U.S. without documentation, including automatic green cards for immigrants protected by the Temporary Protected Status program, generally issued to people fleeing emergencies, and DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, policies for people who came as children.\\n\\nBut this also comes at a time when, as we've also said, the president-elect's margins in Congress are narrow. So we wanted to talk more about what advocates and policy experts believe will be possible. For that, we're joined by Theresa Cardinal Brown. She worked on immigration policy in the administrations of President Obama and George W. Bush, and she's now director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\\n\\nTheresa Cardinal Brown, welcome. Thanks for joining us.\\n\\nTHERESA CARDINAL BROWN: Happy to be here.\\n\\nMARTIN: And we're also joined by Chuck Rocha. He is a former senior adviser to the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, and he's one of the people credited with the Sanders campaign's success with Latino voter turnout.\\n\\nChuck Rocha, thank you so much for joining us as well.\\n\\nCHUCK ROCHA: Thanks for having me, Michel.\\n\\nMARTIN: So, Theresa Cardinal Brown, I'm going to start with you because for years, it seemed that there was a Republican and Democratic consensus that the immigration system was broken. But what emerged during the Trump years was a disagreement over how. I mean, it became clear that Trump just thought there was just too much immigration, period. So now that he is gone and that his administration is about to be gone, do you think that that consensus still exists?\\n\\nBROWN: I do think there is a broad consensus not just among elected Republicans and Democrats, but in the country as a whole. One of the ironic things of the results of the Trump presidency that we have seen is that actually, support for immigrants and immigration, people who believe that immigrants are good for the country and people who support either keeping immigration the same or increasing it, have actually gone up. So to the extent that Trump ran on and was trying to please a portion of the electorate that wants to see fewer immigrants, that didn't succeed.\\n\\nAnd additionally, support for legalizing those long-term immigrants who have been here for a long time, especially DREAMers, has also gone up and is now a majority among Republicans and Democrats. So I do think that in spite of the strong enforcement tone that the Trump administration took, there's an underlying consensus. The question is whether or not, with Trump leaving office, that underlying consensus can now come back to the fore and can result in actual changes.\\n\\nMARTIN: Chuck, do you agree with that?\\n\\nROCHA: I do. I think when you have an issue that the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce agree on, it seems like we could get Congress to agree on it as well. I own a large political consulting firm made up of entirely Latino staff. I have DACA recipients and TPS recipients who work directly for me. So as an employer of these young people that have been here since they were little kids who are amazing people who are way smarter than me and way better than I'll ever be, this is exactly the kind of things we should be fixing first.\\n\\nAnd then there's many more things we should address in making sure that our system that's been - we love to say that it's broken. It's more than broken. We should have a way for folks to legally come into this country immediately through a process that's fair and equitable, where we're having the best of everybody who wants to come here in a legal way. Set up something that's not just a militarization of our borders, but something that's fair and equitable to everybody because 99.9% of everybody who comes to this country aspires to be an American. They aspire to pay taxes and be part of a fabric that we all look back to our ancestry about to make this place even better than it is.\\n\\nMARTIN: So what I'm hearing you saying is that both of you think that there's a consensus around, you know, normalizing the status of the people who are already here and creating a more orderly system of immigration so that people aren't in limbo for - what? - in some cases, you know, 20 years. I mean, you hear stories about people who've been actually trying to sort of figure out how to normalize their status for 10 or 20 years. I mean, and there doesn't seem to sort of be a way to do it. So I hear that.\\n\\nBut, Theresa, but - you know what? As a person who worked on this for years, if that was the consensus that existed before, why did nothing change for all those years? And what gives you some - what gives you hope that something can change now?\\n\\nBROWN: Well, I think we need to kind of understand a little bit of history. So, you know, starting in the early 2000s with President George W. Bush, there was this idea - and it was a consensus among a lot of immigration advocates on the left and the right - that we needed what was called comprehensive immigration reform. And how that was defined was three pieces. It was legalization for those already here, it was border security, and it was reforms of the legal immigration system.\\n\\nAnd Republicans insisted continuously that enforcement had to come before legalization. And that was a priority, and that limited the ability of things to get done. Over the years, that idea of the trade-off of border security for legalization, especially as we have seen what the Trump administration did with enforcement and how they ramped that up to 110 and the ways it was done and how many Americans felt that it was not done in a way that was humane, the epitome of which was the separation of children from their parents - I think that trade-off is no longer quite there.\\n\\nWhat we have heard from the Biden administration is this bill is going to have a very broad legalization component. What we haven't heard enough of, I think, is where the legal immigration piece fits. So one of the things, I think, that we need to kind of come back to - and I hope the Biden administration will do this - is looking again at legal immigration system reforms. I think that's going to be the key because we have to have an alternative to enforcement to deal with the next people who want to come.\\n\\nMARTIN: So, Chuck, what about that? I mean, if you agree that sort of normalizing the status of people who are already here is a priority, what comes after that? I mean, you have your ear to the ground in communities. What are you hearing on that question?\\n\\nROCHA: Well, what Theresa has described is right, and it's common-sense policy, the way she's looking at this and the way that anybody with common sense would think of a policy solution around border security based off of legalization. And this turns into this policy debate. But the problem is not about the policy debate or what comes first, the chicken or the egg. The problem is politics. And it's just raw politics has kept all of this from happening at a lot of different levels.\\n\\nYou know, we're willing to give Biden a shot and let him prove us wrong in believing in what he's doing and see if he starts by doing the right things. Immediately, he can roll back some of these racist executive actions. Immediately, he can take a bill like you're talking about to Congress, where I think there's enough will there to probably get something done. It may not be perfect, but it could be a good step forward. All of us don't want to let, you know, perfect be the enemy of good. And we want to see something. And first thing is, these people that are here, the DACA recipients, TPS - let's get some things in here to make sure that we have a pathway for 11 million. What happens with these essential workers who've been working who are undocumented? We should be fast-tracking those people, as the new U.S. senator from California is proposing with Congressman Castro. Like, I think there are middle grounds here we can do immediately that would really make the left wing of the Latino movement feel a lot less anxious and will trust Biden more and more and more as this administration goes forward.\\n\\nMARTIN: OK, Theresa - final thought from you, though, on this question. I mean, you heard what Chuck said as a political, you know, player. His - you know, his argument - it isn't the policy, it's the politics. And that's kind of pretty much what you were saying as well. So how optimistic are you that if there are successes in this area, say, in - that President-elect Biden says are priorities and that you think there's already consensus around - do you think that will create the political will around the sort of the broader changes that you would hope to see - rethinking the legal immigration framework, which is something that people say needs to happen?\\n\\nBROWN: Well, we have to be realistic about Congress. Congress has not worked well for a long time. It didn't really work all that great under the last years of the Obama administration. It certainly didn't work well under the Trump administration. And as you mentioned, we have a very closely divided House and Senate. What does that mean? That means politically, if you need to get a majority of votes on either side - and I'm especially concerned about the Senate - you're going to have to appeal to the moderates.\\n\\nI tend to think that a big bill that the Biden folks are going to introduce Day 1 is not the bill that's going to move. I tend to think that we are going to see smaller efforts that may be able to put on a COVID package. Or, you know, there's talk about reconciliation, although that's limited by something called the Byrd Rule, so it has to relate to revenue or expenditures in order to be on reconciliation. But I think we have to find those smaller packages that can get through. And I tend to think that one way to bring on moderates and those folks in the Republican Party who are for kind of the common-sense solution is to talk more about how legal immigration changes can help businesses. That's what they really want to see. That can bring them on board without necessarily going over the trod ground of border security. But you're going to need to get a few votes from that side.\\n\\nMARTIN: I think this is going to be our first conversation and not our only.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMARTIN: And so let's touch base again as things progress, and we'll talk again. That's Theresa Cardinal Brown from the Bipartisan Policy Center. She worked on immigration policy in the Bush and Obama administrations. We also heard from Chuck Rocha, former senior adviser to the Bernie Sanders campaign and a political consultant. Thank you both so much for talking with us.\\n\\nBROWN: Thank you.\\n\\nROCHA: Thank you, Michel.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF RALEGH LONG'S THE LIZARD)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump Promises Crackdown On Immigrants At Iowa 'Roast And Ride' Event\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\\n\\nDonald Trump returned on Saturday to Iowa, where the race between him and Hillary Clinton remains very close. Trump was there for Iowa freshman Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride fundraiser, which features a motorcycle ride and barbecue.\\n\\nErnst led the group of more than 400 riders on a 42-mile trip that started at a Harley-Davidson dealer in Des Moines and ended on the Iowa State fairgrounds. Trump did not participate in the ride.\\n\\nBeth Smith did. She's a small-business owner in the central Iowa town of Melbourne. She and her husband, Dan, caucused for Trump in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. While many Republican leaders in other states are distancing themselves from Trump, Smith says she is glad Iowa leaders like Ernst are supporting him.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but the majority of the people are the people that voted him into that position, who got him there to begin with, Beth Smith says. You can't just ignore what we've asked for.\\n\\n[Trump] speaks in a way that resonates with millions of Americans and Iowans aren't immune to that, Ernst told reporters the day before the event.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\\n\\nErnst and many Iowa Republicans support the trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership because, they say, it would bring good things to Iowa's agriculture industry. Trump does not support it but didn't mention it on Saturday.\\n\\nOne by one, Iowa's top Republicans took the stage at the fairgrounds livestock pavilion to praise Trump; officials with Ernst say more than 1,800 people were in attendance.\\n\\nIowa's other U.S. senator, Chuck Grassley, was there. He is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and refuses to hold confirmation hearings for President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. The state's former Democratic lieutenant governor and secretary of agriculture, Patty Judge, is challenging Grassley for re-election.\\n\\nGov. Terry Branstad introduced Trump as a man who supports agriculture and the working people in the heartland of this great country. He's going to make America great again, he shouted to the crowd.\\n\\nThis appearance offered a different side of Trump that Iowa hasn't seen much. He stuck to the teleprompter as he talked about issues specific to Iowa.\\n\\nWe are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and family farms for no reason, Trump told the crowd. What they're doing to you is a disgrace.\\n\\nTrump also made a play for minority voters in this crowd of predominantly white people. He referenced Nykea Aldridge, the cousin of NBA player Dwyane Wade, who was shot and killed in Chicago as she pushed her child in a stroller. This came after initial criticism that Trump had politicized the killing in a tweet.\\n\\nIt breaks all of our hearts to see it. It's horrible. It's horrible, Trump said. And it's only getting worse. This shouldn't happen in our country. This shouldn't happen in America.\\n\\nThe Republican presidential nominee also talked about immigration policy in terms that showed him returning to his hard-line stance on a key nexus in his platform, after his startling softened rhetoric on the topic just days ago.\\n\\nHe said that on Day 1 as president, he will use immigration law to prevent crimes, including removing the hundreds and thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into the United States and United States communities under the incompetent Obama/Clinton administration.\\n\\nTrump brought out the family of Sarah Root, an Iowa woman who was killed in a car crash by an immigrant in the country illegally.\\n\\nIowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann says Trump needs the support of the state's GOP leaders.\\n\\nI see this as a dogfight all the way down. I don't really see huge up-and-downs, and every vote's gonna count, Kaufmann said.\\n\\nTrump might really need those high-profile Iowa Republicans to pull it off in November. After all, he came in second in the Iowa caucuses back in February, and President Obama won the state in the last two elections."}

They say, just keep it.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: Retailers like Amazon and Walmart are opting to let you just keep many of the products you want to return and get your money back anyway.

{"original": "S.C. Hands Democrats A Challenge: The Strong Job Market\\n\\nThe most recent Democratic debate started out with a question for Sen. Bernie Sanders, but it was a question any Democratic nominee would have to think about.\\n\\nWe haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower, said CBS moderator Norah O'Donnell. How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?\\n\\nNot all of the candidates call themselves Democratic socialists, of course. But Donald Trump is running for reelection amid a strong economy — unemployment is low and consumer confidence has been high.\\n\\nRead and hear the original story from NPR's Weekend Edition.\\n\\nAnd the conventional wisdom is that a strong economy helps buoy incumbent presidents to reelection — for decades, election prediction models have factored in economic indicators like unemployment and GDP growth. (Trump knows this, and he often trumpets it at his rallies and on Twitter.)\\n\\nAnd the recently-strong economy is a particularly appropriate topic in South Carolina, which is tied with two other states for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 2.3%. And two of the other three early states, New Hampshire and Iowa, are also among the 10 states with the lowest unemployment. That has made these early states a test for Democrats of their economic messages amid a good job market in particular.\\n\\nMaking the case for big changes\\n\\nSanders responded to that first debate question with the economic pitch that has been his standby for years now: The American economy has fundamental problems, chief among them inequality.\\n\\nYou're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires, he said. But you know what, for the ordinary American, things are not so good.\\n\\nEconomist Jared Bernstein says there is something to the idea that there are still underlying economic problems. He served as chief economist to former Vice President Joe Biden but has not publicly endorsed a candidate.\\n\\nThere are far more families than you would think — given an unemployment rate that's at a 50-year low — that have tremendous difficulties making ends meet on what they earn, he said. These arguments about the gap between earnings and needs, I think, provide a real opening for Democrats.\\n\\nAnd there is some evidence for this: Workers are not sharing in growth nearly as much as they used to — more of that new income has gone to shareholders, for example.\\n\\nCandidates also often bring up the tens of millions of uninsured Americans on the campaign trail, or the fact that some Americans need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or a desire to raise workers' wages. Indeed, in South Carolina, an abundance of jobs exists alongside one of the lowest state median incomes in the nation.\\n\\nOne question then for voters is how squeezed they feel. Attending an Orangeburg County Democrats meeting, Kenneth McCaster said he isn't worried about his own economic well-being.\\n\\nSome of us, you know, like I would say for me, you know, I work three or four jobs, he said. So, you know, the economy is fine for me. But there's some other people that are actually suffering because of the economy.\\n\\nTalking about changing the economy structurally, as more-progressive candidates in particular often highlight, can also mean talking about persistent racial inequities. Businessman Tom Steyer highlighted this at this week's debate.\\n\\nEvery single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race, he said. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans.\\n\\nIt's not just policy that wins voters over, though; it's also old-fashioned retail politicking and showing voters you feel their pain.\\n\\nThat is why lawyer Shireen Carter said she likes Elizabeth Warren. She went to a Warren event just ahead of the Iowa caucuses, clutching a printout of her student loan information.\\n\\nCarter read the total aloud: Two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars, seventy-four dollars and fifty-eight cents.\\n\\nI printed it out just to show her today, she said. And I think that it matters to her. I think that she'll feel that for me — that it's a burden.\\n\\nIt's possible that, for some voters, a strong economy provides an opening to tackle large-scale, underlying economic problems that progressives like Warren and Sanders talk about.\\n\\nYou can kind of see the structure and see the opportunity instead of drowning in your situation, said Jessica Bright, South Carolina state director for Sanders. So definitely the time is right to change structurally, change the systems that we're going up against.\\n\\nFor more moderate candidates, talking about big topics like inequality can also open the door to conversations that might appeal more to centrists. At a town hall ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden used the Trump tax cuts to talk about fiscal responsibility.\\n\\nHow many of you really got boosted by that great tax cut? Well, good for you, he said. But by and large, most people didn't do all that well by the tax cut. But it did increase this gigantic deficit.\\n\\nThe reality: The economy has been pretty strong\\n\\nAll of this said, it remains true that some Democratic voters simply know that the economy has been running along at a steady clip.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean they give Trump credit, though. Joyce Delk, who knocked doors for Biden in South Carolina last week, gives him some credit for today's economy.\\n\\nI don't care what Trump says now that the economy is doing well, but the economy is still rolling off President Obama and Joe Biden — what they did when they were in office, she said.\\n\\nGiven that, some Democrats are hesitant to nominate a self-proclaimed socialist who wants to overhaul entire segments of the economy. And they worry that that kind of a message would, at best, fall flat with general-election voters.\\n\\nIt's also possible that the U.S. is now in a sort of post-economic election era. That's what political analyst Charlie Cook said at a Washington economic conference this week.\\n\\nRight now, the economy is not driving American politics, he said. You don't have unemployment at a 50-year low while at the same time you've got a president who has never ever had a 50% job approval rating in any credible national poll.\\n\\nWhatever is motivating voters, though, the economy for now underpins Trump's reelection message. If the coronavirus (and fears about it) further rattle the U.S. economy, however, it could mean an entirely new backdrop for November's election."}
{"original": "Trump Administration Urges States To Open COVID-19 Vaccination To Everyone Over 65\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated 2:20 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe Trump administration is making several big changes to its COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategy, officials announced Tuesday, in a bid to jump-start the rollout and get more Americans vaccinated quickly.\\n\\nThe first change is to call on states to expand immediately the pool of people eligible to receive vaccines to those 65 and older, and those with underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to COVID-19.\\n\\nWe're telling states today that they should open vaccinations to all of their most vulnerable people. That is the most effective way to save lives now, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a press briefing Tuesday.\\n\\nThe call is accompanied by a change in how vaccine doses are allocated to states. Currently, doses are given to states based on their total adult populations. Starting in two weeks, vaccines will be distributed to states based on the number of over 65-year-olds who live there — and by the pace of vaccine administration reported by states.\\n\\n[This new allocation system] gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work, protecting people rather than sitting on shelves or in freezers, Azar said at the press briefing, We need doses going to where they'll be administered quickly and where they'll protect the most vulnerable.\\n\\nThe administration is also urging states to expand vaccination to more venues, such as convention center mega-sites, pharmacies and community health centers.\\n\\nIn addition, senior officials announced they would stop holding second doses of the vaccines in reserve and instead ship more doses to states right away.\\n\\nBecause we now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, Azar said. We're now making the full reserve of doses we have available for order, [and] we are 100% committed to ensuring a second dose is available for every American who receives the first dose.\\n\\nThe change in releasing more of the previously reserved doses of vaccine preempts a policy change the Biden team announced last week. Officials from the Biden team declined to comment on Tuesday's policy announcements.\\n\\nI think it is appropriate to expand the groups, bring more people into the eligible pools, said Robert Wachter, chair of the University of San Francisco, California Department of Medicine. When you hear people throwing out vaccine because they couldn't find anybody to give it to ... it's just a tragedy.\\n\\nWachter said, in tandem with opening up vaccine eligibility, details about scheduling to match supply with demand need to be worked out.\\n\\nBut other public health experts raised concerns that this rapid expansion and change in allocation method could throw more uncertainty into the mix for states.\\n\\nSpecifically, the expansion of eligibility to the vast, undefined population of people with underlying conditions could be problematic, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. This is not making things easier to get vaccine into arms. This is unquestionably making things harder, and will cause considerable confusion among the public.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's call to expand vaccine eligibility also deviates from previous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which had recommended that front-line, essential workers and those over 75 be next in line, after health care workers and long-term care residents. Essential workers include groups such as grocery, agricultural and transportation workers who are at high risk of exposure.\\n\\nWhile the decision for who is eligible to get a vaccine is up to states, recommendations from the federal government are influential.\\n\\nWe are all wanting to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, said Grace Lee, a pediatrician at Stanford and a member of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. But we [need to] focus on both people at the highest risk of infection and the people at highest risk of severe disease in order to stop this pandemic.\\n\\nThe move to expand eligibility to over 65-year-olds by Trump administration officials seems well-intentioned, but it is incredibly confusing to the public and disruptive to those trying to implement these programs to keep switching up eligibility every few days, noted Dr. Kelly Moore, deputy director of the nonprofit advocacy group the Immunization Action Coalition and a former immunization manager in Tennessee.\\n\\nHitching state allocations to the pace of vaccinations could make it much harder for states to schedule vaccine clinics, critics said.\\n\\nStates have had issues all along, with not knowing how much [vaccine] they're going to get, Hannan said. Saying that we're going to base the allocation on how much data is getting [reported] in the right place in the right hour — and that could change week to week. It's impossible to plan.\\n\\nIn the press conference, Trump administration officials presented these changes as a way to speed up distribution. However, they described the vaccine distribution process to date as flawless on their part and blamed the hitches in vaccine rollout on states.\\n\\nSome states' heavy-handed micromanagement of this process has stood in the way of vaccines reaching a broader swath of the vulnerable population more quickly, Azar said.\\n\\nStates and the federal government have traded accusations over who's responsible for the slow pace of vaccinations. Democratic governors and lawmakers have both urged the Trump administration in recent days to make changes to the distribution to improve the speed of the process.\\n\\nThe country is currently a labyrinth of different stages of rollout and different policies, said Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which released an analysis on the subject this week.\\n\\nThere are already cases where states have moved and said we are vaccinating 65 [and older], and they just do not have a vaccine to do it or they don't have vaccinators to do it, she said. So there is a risk here if the systems that will get vaccines to actual arms are not in place or not sufficient that we're going to have a lot of people eligible and not able to get vaccine.\\n\\nThe danger, she added, is making people who are willing to get vaccinated so frustrated they give up."}
{"original": "FACT CHECK: Clinton Lays Out Economic Plan In Contrast To Trump\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nEditor's note: NPR fact-checked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's economic speech on Monday.\\n\\nTrump delivered an address Monday to the Detroit Economic Club, outlining a plan to cut taxes and get rid of regulations. Today was Hillary Clinton's turn, where she argued that her plan would boost the middle class while Trump's plan would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers.\\n\\nClinton spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering, an advanced manufacturing facility in Warren, Mich. Clinton has been talking about her jobs plan for weeks now, visiting factories and small business. Her address was meant as a contrast to Trump's dark vision of the state of American manufacturing and focus on coal and steel, industries that have been in steep decline for more than a generation.\\n\\nListen To Hillary Clinton's Economic Speech 47:36\\n\\nAs she's talked about the economy, Clinton has faced a couple of challenges; convincing white working class voters that she feels their pain and condensing her five point economic plan into something simple, catchy and satisfying.\\n\\nShe spent much of the speech drawing out contrasts with Trump, portraying them as unrealistic and destructive, while describing her own proposals.\\n\\nClinton also debuted a new attack on Trump's tax plan saying it includes a Trump Loophole designed to benefit his businesses and cut his own personal tax burden.\\n\\nTrump's actual personal tax burden is unknown because he has broken with the long-standing tradition of presidential candidates and hasn't yet released his tax returns for public review.\\n\\nA source close to Clinton says she will be releasing her 2015 tax returns in the coming days (all of her tax returns dating back to the 1970s have been released to the public) and her running mate Tim Kaine will be releasing ten years of his family's tax returns as well. This is intended to put additional pressure on Trump, who has said he won't release his taxes while they are under audit, something he claims is ongoing.\\n\\nHillary Clinton, Futuramic Tool & Engineering, Warren, Mich.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you so much.\\n\\nI have to tell you, I am thrilled to be here for a number of reasons. First, it's wonderful to be back in Michigan. You can really feel the energy and dynamism that is driving this state's comeback.\\n\\n[The unemployment rate in Michigan peaked in June 2009 at a stunning 14.9 percent and has been falling essentially ever since. Unemployment in the state as of June 2016 was 4.6 percent, though that is a preliminary reading. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nAnd, in Detroit, we've got new businesses opening, neighborhoods like Midtown and Eastern Market are coming back, the auto industry just had its best year ever.\\n\\n[By the measure of new cars purchased, 2015, was in fact a banner year. Take this headline from Car And Driver: Boom! We Look Back at 2015 U.S. Auto Sales, the Best Year Ever. The article credits the improved economy. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nOver in Ann Arbor, high tech firms are thriving, the next generation of engineers are getting trained up in Houghton and here at Futuramic, so well named, you are on the front lines of what I believe will be a true manufacturing renaissance in America.\\n\\nI just was given a short but exciting tour by Mark Jurcak and John Couch, who were telling me about how this company, what started as and for most of its early history, was an auto supply company. And then in 2000 as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, they were faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. You are in now what is largely an aerospace company, and because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of Futuramic, you are seeing the future unfold. So, I got to see what's happening here to help build the SLS rocket, that is going to go from Macomb to Mars.\\n\\nI saw the two halves of an F35 nose cone waiting to be put together. I talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work. And what I believe with all my heart is that what's happening here, can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. We are builders and we need to get back to building.\\n\\n[This is a key part of Clinton's economic message. She talks regularly about advanced manufacturing, visiting factories around the country to promote the idea that although American manufacturing won't return to what it once was, it could be something new, more efficient and innovative. This is quite a contrast with Trump's pledge to reopen steel mills that were shuttered a generation ago and bring the coal industry back to what it once was. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nSo we're making progress. None of us can be satisfied until the economic revitalization we're seeing in some parts of Michigan reaches every community but it is inspiring to see this combination of old fashioned hard work and cutting edge innovation. And I know my opponent in this election was here in Michigan about a week ago and it was like he was in a different place. When he visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime. He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great.\\n\\nAnd the same is true when it comes to our country. He describes America as an embarrassment. He said and I quote, 'We're becoming a third world country.' Look around you my friends. Go visit with the workers building rockets. That doesn't happen in third world countries!\\n\\n[Nigeria, India, Iran, Ukraine, and Algeria are developing nations with space programs. — Jonquilyn Hill]\\n\\nNow we have a lot of urgent and important work to do and that's what I'm going to talk about today. Because all of the people that I have met throughout this campaign, really prove how wrong this negative, pessimistic view is. America's best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen.\\n\\nJust consider our assets. We have the most dynamic, productive workforce in the world, bar none. We have the most innovative businesses, the top colleges, universities, community colleges, training programs in the world. And the best science and technology. We have enormous capacity for clean energy production. We are resilient, determined, hardworking - there is nothing America can't do if we do it together. And I know this because this is how I was raised. And I don't think Mr. Trump understands any of it. He hasn't offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face.\\n\\nNow, those challenges emerged long before the great recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There's too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today.\\n\\nBut there are common sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don't we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress. And how can you not be frustrated, and even angry, when you see nothing getting done? And a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back. And that is not how it's supposed to be in America. If I am fortunate enough to be your President, I will have your back every single day that I serve.\\n\\nAnd my mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. This is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class. I was born in Chicago. I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for fifty years. And because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college, and eventually start his own small business – and send me off into the world to follow my dreams.\\n\\nNo matter how far those dreams have taken me, I've always remembered that I'm the daughter of a small-business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker — and proud of both.\\n\\nSo here's what I want. I want every American family to be able to tell the same story. If you work hard. You do your part, you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve. That is the basic bargain of America.\\n\\nNow, whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the 21st century depends, in large measure, on the outcome of this election.\\n\\nSo here are four questions that I hope the American people will ask of both candidates — and that the answers should help make your choice in November crystal clear:\\n\\nFirst, which candidate has a real plan to create good-paying jobs?\\n\\nSecond, who will restore fairness to our economy and ensure that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes?\\n\\nThird, who will really go to bat for working families?\\n\\nAnd, fourth, who can bring people together to deliver results that will make a difference in your lives?\\n\\nNow, I hope that after giving a fair hearing to both sides, you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign – not just Democrats, but a growing number of Republicans and Independents as well.\\n\\n[This week Clinton's campaign launched an initiative called Together For America, designed to reach out to Republicans and Independents who could be persuaded to vote for her. But it's unlikely she will be swaying them on policy. She hasn't moderated her positions at all since the primary. Instead she and her campaign seem to be making a pitch based largely on temperament and values, not on taxes, college affordability or health care policy. One Republican I interviewed who is supporting Clinton over Trump said You have to have a hierarchy of principles at a time like this. And in 2016, tax policy has moved down on his priorities list. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nNow, when it comes to creating jobs, I would argue it's not even close. Even conservative experts say Trump's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain,\\n\\n[Clinton is referring to Mark Zandi here, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. She has brought up the Zandi connection on multiple occasions. Zandi was listed among McCain's advisors on his 2008 campaign, but Zandi also advised the Obama administration on its stimulus package, as the Wall Street Journal reported this year. A search on OpenSecrets.org finds that he contributed to John McCain, but also to several Democrats over the years — including Hillary Clinton last year. All of which is to say that while solely linking him to McCain might imply that he's a conservative economist, that would be misleading. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nif you add up all of Trump's ideas – from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with China to deporting millions of hard-working immigrants — the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs.\\n\\n[This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nBy contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs.\\n\\n[This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. (Meaning the same would be true of the assumptions underlying the report on Clinton's policies — see below.) — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nSo let me tell you how we would do it.\\n\\nI believe every American willing to work hard should be able to find a job that provides dignity, pride, and decent pay that can support a family.\\n\\nSo starting on Day One, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.\\n\\nWe will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports. We are way overdue for this, my friends.\\n\\n[Spending on infrastructure is one area where Clinton and Trump agree. She has proposed spending $275 billion over five years on infrastructure. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would double Clinton's spending on infrastructure — that's a big change from the usual Republican economic thinking, as the Wall Street Journal's Michelle Hackman wrote, as it could mean a significantly bigger deficit. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents' generations.\\n\\nWe will also help cities like Detroit and Flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity, expanding affordable housing, and repair schools and failing water systems as well.\\n\\nYou know, I happen to think we should be ambitious. While we're at it, let's connect every household to broadband by the year 2020. It's astonishing to me how many places in America not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don't have access to broadband. And that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the Internet; 5 million of them live in homes without access to the Internet. So you talk about an achievement gap, it starts right there. And let's build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well.\\n\\nSome country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it, which will help to grow our economy.\\n\\n[Bringing jobs back from overseas is a major theme of Trump's campaign that has resonated with many voters around the country. On the issue of energy, Trump primarily focuses on reviving older energy sources like coal and promoting fracking, though he has talked about advocating clean coal technology.An analysis by Scientific American found that Trump's promise to bring back closed coal mines would be difficult to fulfill, both because of environmental regulations and economic shifts -Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nAnd here's something you don't always hear enough from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay.\\n\\nAnd that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans.\\n\\nAnd we're going to invest $10 billion in Make it in America partnerships to support American manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries.\\n\\nWhen Mark and John were giving me the tour and I was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at Futuramic, what I hear all over the country - Germany, Japan, Italy - I want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the United States. There is no reason we can't begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else.\\n\\nLet's also expand incentives like the New Market Tax Credits that can bring businesses, government, and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind.\\n\\nFrom neglected neighborhoods in Detroit and Flint to Logging Country, Coal Country, and Native American communities.\\n\\nFrom rural areas ravaged by addiction and lost jobs to industrial regions hollowed out when factories closed.\\n\\nAs president, I will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs.\\n\\nWith new national initiatives to cut red tape at every level and expand access to credit, especially through community banks and credit unions.\\n\\nI will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses. Right now, the smallest businesses, the kind that my dad had, cause it was a really small business, spend 20 times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to their larger companies. It should be as easy as printing out a bank statement.\\n\\n[This stat comes from 2015 congressional testimony from Tax Analysts Chief Economist Martin A. Sullivan, who found that firms that employ 1 to 5 people spend $1,101 per employee on federal tax compliance, compared to $51 per employee at businesses that have 50 or more employees. In Her Way, authors Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta write about Hugh Rodham's small business, saying that only when his two sons were old enough to pitch in on the occasional Saturday, did he get help. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nLet's free entrepreneurs to do what they do best – innovate, grow, and hire. As Mark said, this company started because of a drive down a road, and thinking about it, talking about it, then seeing one of the old Oldsmobile futuramics and deciding, hey not only do I have an idea, I have a name. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we're going to get back to doing that.\\n\\nNow, Donald Trump has a different view. He's made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas. There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills. A lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn't because Trump couldn't pay them, it was because he wouldn't pay them.\\n\\n[A USA Today investigation found hundreds of people who accuse Trump of failing to pay them for their work. According to USA Today, Trump has put the blame on contractors he hired as go-betweens, and has said that the events described happened long ago. The Wall Street Journal has done similar reporting. - Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nAnd that's why I take it personally. My dad ran a printing plant. He had two really long tables. He printed fabric for draperies. He would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen and he would go down the table, he'd put the silkscreen down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, he'd go across the screen, he'd lift it up, he'd go down all the way to the end and then he'd start on the other table. He worked hard. And then when he finished, he would load all that fabric up, put it in his car, and take it to the business that had ordered it - maybe a restaurant, or a hotel or some office. He expected to be paid when he showed up. He did the work. He paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs. He expected to be paid. I can't imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had gotten a contract from Trump. And showing up and submitting his bill had been told we're not going to pay and if you don't like it, sue us. My father never could have sued a big organization like that. I just don't understand it.\\n\\nI've met all kinds of workers, painters, plumbers. I've met small businesses that provided pianos, installed glass or marble, all of whom were denied payment and after going back time and again being told, well maybe we'll pay thirty cents on the dollar or fifty cents on the dollar. That's not how we do business in America.\\n\\nSo we've got to create more good jobs that are going to help more people.\\n\\nFor example, our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices and greater flexibility. But we need to do more to empower the workers in our service sector too. The people taking care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement.\\n\\nAnd, it's crucial that every American have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future.\\n\\nSo we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone.\\n\\n[This is a relatively new position for Clinton. For much of the primary, Clinton's plan was for debt free college. Then after the voting was done as part of negotiations with the Bernie Sanders campaign, Clinton agreed to expand her proposal to make public universities tuition free for middle class and low income students. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nWe will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford.\\n\\nIt's not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs.\\n\\nAnd here's something neither party talks about enough: a four-year degree shouldn't be the only path to a good job. You should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and make a good living doing it.\\n\\nSo many Americans have the talent and the will to succeed — whether they're kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing.\\n\\nFor too long, big promises about the power of training and retraining haven't delivered like they should. It doesn't help anyone to be trained for a job that doesn't exist.\\n\\nSo we'll support high-quality union training programs, propose new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn, and do more to dignify skills training across the board – for welders, machinists, health technicians, and so many other fields.\\n\\nI'm sure some of you are thinking, that all sounds good. But what about trade? After all, Trump talks about it all the time.\\n\\nWell, let's start with this: It's true that too often,past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn't pan out. Those promises now ring hollow in many communities across Michigan and our country that have seen factories close and jobs disappear.\\n\\nToo many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States.\\n\\nIt's also true that China and other countries have gamed the system for too long. Enforcement — especially during the Bush administration — has been too lax. Investments at home that would make us more competitive have been blocked. And American workers and communities have paid the price.\\n\\nBut the answer is not to rant and rave – or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us.\\n\\nSo my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\nI oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.\\n\\n[This is Clinton's strongest language yet about the trade deal she called a gold standard when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. At the time, the trade pact was in the early stages of negotiations. For the first several months of her campaign, Clinton resisted taking a position on TPP, saying the deal was still being negotiated. She finally weighed in last October, a week before the first Democratic debate, saying she couldn't support it in its current form. Many progressives are suspicious that, like President Obama did, she would soften her opposition to the trade deal if she is elected. Donald Trump has also charged that Clinton fully intends to sign off on TPP if she is president. Clinton has held firm in her opposition, but in an interview a close political ally of hers seemed to confirm the suspicions, saying she would likely implement it as president. The campaign moved immediately to tamp that down and Clinton in this speech was unequivocal — perhaps because she had to be. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nAs a Senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel-makers from unfair Chinese trading practices.\\n\\nAnd I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn't meet my high bar.\\n\\n[Clinton voted against the multilateral Trade Act of 2002. However, she did vote in favor of six bilateral trade agreements during her her tenure as a U.S. Senator. — Jonquilyn Hill]\\n\\nAs Secretary of State, I fought hard for American businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property.\\n\\nAs President, I'll stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take advantage of American workers and companies.\\n\\nI'm going to ramp up enforcement by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor, tripling the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules, we won't hesitate to impose targeted tariffs.\\n\\nAnd Trump? He may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength. Fear that we can't compete with the rest of the world even when the rules are fair. Fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls.\\n\\nIf Team USA was as fearful as Trump, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles [sim-OWN BYE-ells] would be cowering in the locker room. Instead, they're winning gold medals. Because America isn't afraid to compete.\\n\\nRight now, thousands of Michigan companies are exporting billions of dollars of products around the world. We want them to sell even more – and create more jobs here at home.\\n\\nBut corporations shouldn't abandon profitable operations here to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus, and unions a weaker hand to play.\\n\\nNow, before he tweets about how he's really one who'll put America First in trade, let's remember where Trump makes many of his own products. Because it's sure not America.\\n\\nHe's made Trump ties in China and Trump suits in Mexico instead of here in Michigan.\\n\\n[Trump says he manufactures products outside the United States because he's a businessman and that's the best way to compete in the current marketplace. What's unclear, as conservative and liberal observers have pointed out, is what policies Trump would propose to change the current market dynamics to encourage textile production in the U.S. -Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nHe keeps saying it's not possible to make these things in America anymore. That's just wrong.\\n\\nWe created a website — hillaryclinton.com/make-it-here — with a list of a hundred places across the United States already producing similar goods.\\n\\nOne positive thing Trump could do to make America great again is to actually make great things in America again.\\n\\nNow, let's look at the second question: which candidate will fight for fairness?\\n\\nThis is an urgent need. The tide isn't rising fast enough, and it's certainly not lifting all boats. Since the crash, too many of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent.\\n\\nThe rules and incentives of our economy reward corporations for putting short-term stock prices above long-term investments in workers, equipment, and research.\\n\\nWhile corporate profits are at near-record highs, paychecks for most people have barely budged.\\n\\nIncomes aren't growing fast enough to keep up with costs like prescription drugs and child care.\\n\\nI believe that every employee, from the CEO suite to the factory floor, contributes to a business' success, so everybody should share in the rewards – especially those putting in long hours for little pay.\\n\\nSo I'm proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with workers.\\n\\nMore broadly, we will fight for a more progressive, more patriotic tax code that puts American jobs first.\\n\\nRight now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We should stop that, and instead make them give back tax breaks they received here at home. For those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they should pay a new exit tax.\\n\\nAnd Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes.\\n\\nI support the Buffett Rule, because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.\\n\\nWe should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires... crack down on tax gaming by corporations... and close the carried interest loophole – something I've been calling for years.\\n\\nWhat does Trump say? There's a myth out there that he'll stick it to the rich and powerful because, at heart, he's really on the side of the little guy. Don't believe it.\\n\\nNot when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable...when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink... and let insurance companies write their own rules again.\\n\\nTrump would roll back tough rules on the financial industry. I'll do the opposite – we should strengthen those rules so that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again!\\n\\nTrump even wants to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already returned more than $11 billion to 25 million Americans. Why would you get rid of that?\\n\\nThen there's Trump's tax plan. He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt and lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection.\\n\\nIn his speech on Monday, he called for a new tax loophole – let's call it the Trump Loophole.\\n\\nIt would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies. He'd pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.\\n\\nOne nonpartisan expert at the Tax Policy Center described this plan as, quote, a really nice deal... for Donald Trump. Of course, it's hard to say how nice, because he refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns.\\n\\nBut we do know that the 400 richest taxpayers in America would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from this loophole.\\n\\nThen there's the Estate Tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether. If you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans. Let me repeat that: the Trump family gets a $4 billion tax cut... and 99.8 percent of Americans get nothing.\\n\\nJust think about what we could do with those $4 billion dollars. We could pay for more than 47,000 veterans to get a 4-year college degree.\\n\\n[That's about right, so long as not every veteran chooses to go to a public school outside their state. In the 2015-2016 school year, the cost of in-state tuition and fees for one year at 4-year public colleges - the GI Bill won't pay for private colleges - was just over $9,000. Multiply that by four years and you get $36,000. Multiply that by 47,000 and you get about $1.7 billion - well under Clinton's estimate. But out-of-state tuition was just under $24,000 per year. Do the same math and you'll end up at $4.5 billion, slightly over Clinton's estimate. - Meg Anderson]\\n\\nWe could provide a year's worth of health care to nearly 3 million kids.\\n\\n[The Children's Health Insurance Program insures more than 8 million children annually and costs more than $13 billion. Insuring 3 million more kids represents an increase of about 37 percent. When you factor that increase into the cost, you'll see an increase slightly under $5 billion — which is probably what makes the word nearly important in this claim. - Meg Anderson]\\n\\nOr fund about a year's worth of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement. That's a better way to spend the money.\\n\\nOn Monday, I'm going to be in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Vice President Biden. He has a saying: Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.\\n\\nWell, Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest in our veterans, our kids, and our police officers. You can judge for yourself about our values.\\n\\nNow, it's true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families. As usual, he's making big promises. But, his advisors have said that he may not stand by them.Instead, the tax cuts he doubled down on in his speech on Monday offer trillions to the richest Americans and corporations. One of the differences between Donald Trump and me is that I'll stand by my plans.\\n\\nSo this is another case of the old saying that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\\n\\nThis brings us to the third question: Which candidate can you actually count on to go to bat for workers and working families?\\n\\nIt's not enough to pay lip service to being on your side. We have to recognize how Americans actually live and work in the 21st century – and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier.\\n\\nWe know that women are now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families. And more Americans are cobbling together part time work, or striking out on their own. So we have to make it easier to be good workers, good parents, and good caregivers, all at the same time.\\n\\nThat's why I've set out a bold vision to make quality, affordable childcare available to all Americans and limit costs to 10 percent of family income.\\n\\nOn Monday, Trump offered his first real ideas on this topic. Previously, he dismissed concerns about childcare. He said it was, quote, not an expensive thing because you just need some blocks and you need some swings.\\n\\nNow he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation. But his plan was panned left, right, and center – because it's transparently designed for rich people.\\n\\nHe would give wealthy families 30 or 40 cents on the dollar for their nannies, and little or nothing for millions of hard-working families trying to afford childcare so they can get to work and keep the job.\\n\\n[Trump's proposed income tax deduction on the average cost of childcare was criticized for likely being more of a help to higher-income families than to many working-class families. However, the Trump campaign has also said that it will allow lower-income families to deduct the cost of childcare from their payroll taxes. The campaign says it will offer more details in coming weeks on their childcare plans. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe can do better. We should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families Donald Trump's plan largely ignores.\\n\\nThis is just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit.\\n\\nFor example, guaranteeing equal pay won't just increase paychecks for women – it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board. Yet for some reason, Trump's against it.\\n\\nPaid family leave won't only make life easier for moms and dads — it will also keep skilled, talented Americans in the workforce and grow our economy. That's why every other advanced economy already offers it. But again, Trump's against it.\\n\\n[There are no federal legal requirements for paid family leave in the U.S., and among OECD countries, the United States is the only country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave. Some states have their own paid leave laws and most U.S. workers are covered by the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows for up to 12 weeks of leave annually, albeit unpaid. - Meg Anderson]\\n\\nRaising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pocket of low-income families – it also means they spend more money at the businesses in their neighborhoods. Trump's against that as well.\\n\\nExpanding Social Security won't just help older Americans retire with dignity – it will ease burdens on families and communities.\\n\\nPassing comprehensive immigration reform won't just help keep hard-working families together – it will grow our entire economy.\\n\\nAnd finally, strengthening unions doesn't just serve members – it leads to better pay, and benefits, and working conditions for all employees.\\n\\n[A large body of academic research suggests that labor unions do raise the overall level of wages and benefits in the economy. An influential 2011 research paper found that declines in union membership since 1973 accounted for a third of the increase in wage inequality for male workers and a fifth of the increase in wage inequality for female workers. -Brett Neely]\\n\\nAnd giving Americans in every state the choice of a public-option health insurance plan won't just help those who struggle to afford coverage – it will strengthen competition and drive down costs for everyone.\\n\\nThese are all causes I've worked on for decades. I believe they point to a fundamental truth about our economy. It may seem zero-sum when you're competing for a job, a promotion, or a contract – someone wins and someone loses. But that's not the full picture. If you step back, you'll see that we really are all in this together.\\n\\nIf we grow together, we can all rise together. Because we're stronger together.\\n\\nAnd that's why the fourth question is key: Who can bring people together to get any of this done?\\n\\nWhat we need is serious, steady leadership that can find common ground and build on it based on hard but respectful bargaining.\\n\\nLeadership that rises above personal attacks and name calling, not revels in it.\\n\\nDonald Trump insults, shouts down, and bullies his opponents. He can't even play nice with his friends.\\n\\nI know it's hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together. I know because I did it as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. It's how we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 8 million kids, rebuilt New York after 9/11, and passed a treaty reducing the threat from Russia's nuclear weapons.\\n\\nSo I am convinced we can work together again.\\n\\nOne of the reasons I asked Tim Kaine to be my running mate is that he has a record of working across the aisle to get things done, as a mayor, governor, and now Senator.\\n\\nTogether, we'll make full use of the White House's power to convene. We'll get everyone at the table – not just Republicans and Democrats, but business and labor leaders... academics and experts... and, most importantly, all of you. I want working people to have a real say in your government again.\\n\\nThat means we have to get unaccountable money out of our politics, overturn Citizens United, and expand voting rights, not restrict them.\\n\\nStarting even before the election, we will bring together leaders from across our economy and our communities for meetings on jobs,American competitiveness, and working families. We all need to pull together and give our country the best chance to succeed.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: I'm running for president to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\\n\\nDonald Trump wants America to work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else.\\n\\nHe's offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today. Nothing on student loans or the cost of prescription drugs. Nothing for farmers and struggling rural communities looking to build a new future with clean energy and advanced agriculture. Nothing for communities of color in our cities to overcome barriers of systemic racism and create new opportunities for young people.\\n\\nAll he does offer is an even more extreme version of the failed theory of trickle-down economics, with the addition of his own unique Trumpian spin – outlandish ideas that even many Republicans reject.\\n\\nTrump may believe that he alone can fix our country. Clearly, he doesn't know the people of Michigan. He doesn't see businesses, labor unions, local government, clergy and community leaders coming together every single day to make things better.\\n\\nYes, there is still a long road ahead, but Michigan is on the rise. And everyone is contributing. That's America at its best.\\n\\nI hope you'll stay active and engaged – working together to create jobs and build up your communities... working together to get out the vote and win in November... and working together after the election to press for the real progress we need.\\n\\nAs your president, I'll be your partner every step of the way. Because our nation needs every one of us to lend our energy, talents, and ambition to making America better.\\n\\nStronger Together is not just a slogan for our campaign. It's a guiding principle for the future we're going to build. And it's the choice we've got to make this November — whether our country will work for everyone, or just for those at the top.\\n\\nWhether it'll be a stronger together economy where we all rise together, or an us versus them economy where we all fight over a shrinking pie.\\n\\nI think the choice is clear. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So I'm asking for your support to help make that happen.\\n\\nThank you very much."}
{"original": "Aftermath Of An Interview\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\\n\\nThis is National News Literacy Week. In that spirit, here are some thoughts on the journalistic ethics surrounding the interview that NPR's Mary Louise Kelly conducted last week with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the aftermath, prompted by questions to my office.\\n\\nA quick recap: Kelly, co-host of All Things Considered, interviewed Pompeo at the State Department on Friday. Seven minutes of the interview centered on the Trump administration's Iran policy. Two minutes at the end were devoted to questions raised about Pompeo's stewardship of the State Department in the wake of Congressional hearings about the administration's Ukraine policy. As the interview shows (listen here) Pompeo objected to the Ukraine questions at the time they were asked, but then continued to answer them until Katie Martin, deputy assistant secretary for the State Department, politely ended the interview.\\n\\nHad their interaction ended there, I might not be writing about this. It's what happened afterward that thrust this event into the limelight. As Kelly reported, Martin asked her to come to Pompeo's private quarters without her tape recorder, but, as Kelly told All Things Considered, Martin did not say we were off the record, nor would I have agreed. She continued:\\n\\nI was taken to the secretary's private living room where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview itself had lasted. He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine. He asked, do you think Americans care about Ukraine? He used the F-word in that sentence and many others. He asked if I could find Ukraine on a map; I said yes. He called out for his aides to bring him a map of the world with no writing, no countries marked. I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, people will hear about this. And then he turned and said he had things to do, and I thanked him again for his time and left.\\n\\nThe next day, Pompeo's office released this statement, which accused Kelly of lying:\\n\\nNPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record. It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity. It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine.\\n\\nLying is a serious charge and the actions that Pompeo claimed would go against NPR's ethics code, if true. But I have seen no evidence that these claims are true. Both Nancy Barnes, NPR's top news executive, and John Lansing, NPR's chief executive, publicly supported Kelly in the aftermath.\\n\\nNo surprise, we heard from critics who took the secretary of state at his word. Wrote a Georgia listener: Pompeo is doing the work of the people and I have no reason not to believe Pompeo. When he requested to only discuss Iran, how dare you move the discussion to Ukraine. When he requested to make comments 'off the record' — how dare you bring them to the public.\\n\\nKelly provided me with her email exchanges with Martin, Pompeo's press secretary, on the eve of the interview. Here are the relevant parts:\\n\\nMartin wrote: Just wanted to touch base that we still intend to keep the interview to Iran tomorrow. Know you just got back from Tehran so we would like to stick to Iran as the topic as opposed to jumping around. Is that something we can agree to? Kelly replied: I am indeed just back from Tehran and plan to start there. Also Ukraine. And who knows what the news gods will serve up overnight. I never agree to take anything off the table. To which Martin replied: ... your last request that prompted this interview was about the situation in Iran. Totally understand you want to ask other topics but just hoping we can stick to that topic for a healthy portion of the interview. The Secretary knows you were just over there and have experienced a lot of what we were watching from the US. Wouldn't want to spend the interview on questions he's answered many times for the last several months. I just don't think it will yield the interesting interview we are hoping for. And Kelly replied in the final email: My plan is to start on Iran and, yes, to spend a healthy portion of the interview there. Iran has been my focus of late as well. And yes — I also would not want to waste time on questions he's answered many times in recent months.\\n\\nTo highlight the relevant parts, Kelly stated her intention to start with Iran and devote most of the interview to the topic, and she kept to that (almost 7 minutes out of 9). Kelly let the secretary's office know that Ukraine (and possibly other topics) would be raised. Martin did not object to Kelly's stated plan (Totally understand you want to ask other topics ...). And Kelly said clearly that, I never agree to take anything off the table.\\n\\nKelly told me there were no other advance conversations with Pompeo where she agreed to take any topics off the table. We can't know what Martin told Pompeo prior to the interview, but I see no evidence that Kelly broke her word. I asked Martin for comment and did not hear back. I will update this post if I do.\\n\\nI prefer to let the interview and our journalism speak for themselves.\\n\\nOn the second issue of whether Kelly reneged on an agreement to keep the after-interview remarks off the record, there's no evidence there, either, to support Pompeo's claim. Two other NPR newsroom employees, a producer and an editor, were in the room when Martin asked Kelly to meet privately with Pompeo in his private chambers. Both told me that they heard the exchange and neither heard any mention of off the record, which, as Kelly said, she would not have agreed to. Kelly said she, Martin and Pompeo were the only ones in Pompeo's private chambers for that portion of the conversation.\\n\\nAt this point I should note that there are no codified rules for the practice of journalism. But there are conventions that journalists and most public officials of Pompeo's rank try to adhere to. Off the record is generally accepted to mean that the information cannot be reported in any manner. And it's not enough for an official (or press secretary) to unilaterally declare it so, either before or after the fact. The journalist must agree beforehand that any information to be provided will be off the record.\\n\\nAs Kelly told me, I was at the State Department on Friday to interview Mike Pompeo, and unless I agree any portion of our conversation is off the record, it's not. Some journalists will agree to go off the record just to hear what the official has to say. Many others like Kelly will not, because they do not want their hands to be tied if they learn something truly important that they then cannot report.\\n\\nWas what Kelly learned in that private session fair game? Most certainly. Pompeo is the country's top diplomat. As such, his demeanor at all times is relevant information.\\n\\nOne other email jumped out at me, from a listener in Nantucket, Mass., who has occasionally written to my office with thoughtful questions.\\n\\nHer take:\\n\\nI did not want to write this comment but I felt compelled to after listening to Mary Louise Kelly interview Secretary of State Pompeo. I have to ask what is the role of the journalist? When I listened to both of them, very carefully, I heard Ms. Kelly hector and badger the Secretary of State, her voice obviously very emotional. On his side, I heard someone who was trying to control his emotions, yet not giving in to answering her repeated questions about Ukraine. Did Ms. Kelly seriously expect Secretary of State Pompeo to answer these questions or was she asking them for rhetorical effect? Was she trying to prove what a bad guy he is? Whatever she was trying to do, she succeeded in making herself the story. The relationship between the media and the White House has become toxic, and this interview did nothing to reduce the friction and animosity on both sides. I am not excusing the behavior of the Secretary of State in the aftermath of the initial interview, but I've also seen reporters bait White House officials to get an angry response that they can use to show how terrible they are.\\n\\nI asked Kelly if she wanted to respond and she declined, saying, I prefer to let the interview and our journalism speak for themselves.\\n\\nAnd that's exactly how, in my experience, the vast majority of journalists feel. Most reporters fervently do not want to become the story, and when they do, they work to focus the attention back on their work itself. As an aside, I think NPR has been admirably restrained in how it has handled this situation in its reporting, not making it a major focus of attention.\\n\\nBut I'll take a stab at responding to the listener's concerns. What was the purpose of the interview? I often fall back to this American Press Institute definition of the purpose of journalism, which is to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their societies, and their governments. (Certainly, some news outlets also have commercial motives, but NPR is a non-profit, and the mission statement for its newsroom says it exists to serve the public and democracy.)\\n\\nWhen a journalist asks an elected or appointed official for an interview, the goal is to get information that can be reported to the public. In this case, Kelly wanted information about U.S. policy toward Iran, including an issue that should be of vital importance to all: How the U.S. intends to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. She also had questions about Pompeo's stewardship of the State Department, and who is running U.S. foreign policy, which citizens have every right to know.\\n\\nThe interviewee has an agenda, as well, usually to explain a policy or make a point, often of a political nature. Pompeo clearly wanted to explain his position on Iran in the wake of the administration's killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. He did so in answer to her second question.\\n\\nWere Kelly's follow-up questions about Iran or Ukraine emotional and badgering, as the comment from the Nantucket listener heard? I certainly don't hear them that way. She asked very specific questions about policy in the case of Iran, and when she didn't get a direct answer, she asked again, as any good reporter would do. She cited evidence. She was intimately familiar with the subject, just as you hope the Secretary of State would be, since it's his department's policy.\\n\\nAnd it's important to note that, despite Pompeo's subsequent claim, Kelly indicated to Pompeo's press secretary that she also would ask about Ukraine. Pompeo had every right to decline to answer. He did not. He said he wouldn't answer, but then kept answering. As any good interviewer would do, Kelly kept asking. That's not badgering, either. The questions weren't rhetorical; just look at his answers, which were illuminating.\\n\\nFor a very detailed deconstruction of Kelly's excellent interviewing techniques, read this analysis from John Barth, chief content officer at public radio producer PRX.\\n\\nIs the relationship between the news media and the current White House toxic? It's certainly strained, to put it mildly. The president has repeatedly attacked the press and its motives.\\n\\nNonetheless, the State Department wanted to get its message out via an interview on NPR. It's not the role of the media to reduce animosity or to increase it. Instead, it should be NPR's role to report with the goal of giving citizens the information they need to make informed choices. Sometimes that requires pointed and repeated questions, whether or not the official being asked those questions likes it.\\n\\nThe vast majority of emails my office received expressed support for NPR and Kelly. A Virginia listener wrote that she was deeply grateful for Ms. Kelly's clear-headedness and courage in sticking to her purpose and trying to get answers to legitimate questions of public importance. And I appreciate the editorial choices the NPR team made in presenting the interview, especially including the 'coda' and the context it gave the story.\\n\\nI strongly agree. This was exemplary, ethical journalism. But as happens too often these days, this example of good journalism has gotten caught in the downward spiral of a polarized political environment — and the ultimate damage is to the public's right to know what its government is doing.\\n\\nAddendum: NPR's Michele Kelemen, who covers the State Department, was scheduled to be the radio pool reporter accompanying Pompeo on his upcoming trip to Ukraine, among other places. Over the weekend, she was told by the State Department that she would not be allowed to travel with the secretary on the trip. The State Department has not yet given a reason for the action.\\n\\nThe State Department Correspondents' Association protested the decision, noting: The removal of Michele, who was in rotation as the radio pool reporter, comes days after Secretary Pompeo harshly criticized the work of an NPR host. We can only conclude that the State Department is retaliating against National Public Radio as a result of this exchange.\\n\\nLate Tuesday, NPR released a letter from Lansing, NPR's chief executive, to the State Department, asking for a clarification and explanation of the decision."}
{"original": "U.K. Supermarkets To Ban Energy Drinks For Shoppers Under 16\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephane Grangier/Getty Images Stephane Grangier/Getty Images\\n\\nNext month, several chain supermarkets in the U.K. will stop selling energy drinks to customers under 16. Anyone looking to buy a soft drink with more than 150 mg of caffeine per liter — a limit targeting drinks like Monster and Red Bull — will need to present an ID.\\n\\nThe retailer Waitrose announced its new energy drink restrictions first, in early January. These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we're choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under 16s, Simon Moore, Waitrose's director of corporate social responsibility, said in a statement. Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Lidl, Coop, Asda, Aldi and Tesco followed with their own bans on selling the drink to children, which will all roll out at the beginning of March.\\n\\nAs Moore mentioned, European Union and British regulations already require drinks with this much caffeine to sport an extra label stating: High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women. And while a nationwide soda tax will go into effect in the U.K. in April, banning so-called under 16s from buying energy drinks is a voluntary measure that grocery stores have taken up this year.\\n\\nBut the idea of checking IDs for energy drink purchases has been rumbling around for a while. Morrisons tested this initiative in 2014, then ended the pilot at the end of that year.\\n\\nNow, U.K. grocery stores seem to be responding to pressure from a couple of different groups.\\n\\nCelebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who has long championed anti-obesity and nutrition efforts, recently mounted a campaign against energy drinks for kids. He appeared on Good Morning Britain in November, telling the anchors that since the advent of energy drinks, some children consume about 14 espresso shots worth of caffeine per day. He ran a spot on his own show, Friday Night Feast, detailing the dangers energy drinks pose for kids' health and their prospects in school. He also started a hashtag on Twitter: #NotForChildren.\\n\\nThe National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers has blamed energy drink guzzling for poor behavior in school. The group has called for research in the area and supported the grocery store restrictions.\\n\\nPolicy researchers have called for energy drink legislation. Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health, advocated for a law restricting energy drink sales to kids after finding that energy drinks are widely available for students as young as 11 years old. Another group, Action on Sugar, which runs nutrition-focused campaigns from Queen Mary University of London, has also rallied for regulation of these drinks. Although Action on Sugar focuses on sweeteners, the high caffeine in energy drinks worries them, too, says Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist and researcher for the group. Why is it that we have a warning label, but children can buy these products? she says.\\n\\nOverall, it's probably a good idea to pause energy drink sales to children, says Jennifer Temple, a nutrition researcher at the University of Buffalo who has studied how caffeine affects kids. We've seen kind of an explosion of energy drinks on the market over the past decade and a half, without really a whole lot of empirical data to understand what consuming these high amounts of caffeine can do, especially to children and adolescents, she says.\\n\\nAs they've boomed onto the market, energy drinks have been linked to emergency room visits, as well as a number of high-profile deaths, although it's impossible to say definitively that energy drinks are the only culprit in those extreme situations.\\n\\nSmall to moderate doses of caffeine haven't had a huge effect on kids in Temple's research, but she's not enthusiastic about supplying children with energy drinks. A major aim of caffeine — preventing sleep — can interfere with the rest kids need to grow, think and function. There's no reason why kids need this caffeine, she says. The sleep effects alone are something that we should be mindful of.\\n\\nOliver, teachers and those policy groups count the energy drink bans for kids in grocery stores as a victory, but they're not a perfect, overarching solution. The issue with it is that these products will still be bought in convenience stores and other small stores, Hashem says. So while these are positive steps, she says she's still hoping a national law will eventually come into effect."}

Here's NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. on a threat to shoot Iranian ships out of the water.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: In the crowded shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf, Iran and the U.S. have long played a game of cat and mouse. Lately, the mouse has been poking hard. This month, an Iranian vessel came within 100 yards of a U.S. Navy ship. And remember the confrontation in January, when Iran took U.S. sailors into custody after their ship strayed into Iranian territorial waters. The U.S. has condemned Iran's actions. At his Florida campaign stop, Trump advocated going considerably farther.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nTRUMP: When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water, OK? Believe me.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nKELLY: That applause went on a full 30 seconds, a sign the threat played well to his supporters, to foreign policy experts listening, not so much.\\n\\nJAMES JEFFREY: I found this very troubling.\\n\\nKELLY: Ambassador James Jeffrey, he served in senior roles under both Obama and George W. Bush. Jeffrey agrees with Trump that the U.S. should push back harder against Iranian provocations. He calls the Obama administration's response lackluster. But...\\n\\nJEFFREY: It's one thing to say I would be tougher on the Iranians. That's a reasonable position. But to say, if they harass us, I'll blow them out of the water, that would be terribly dangerous.\\n\\nKELLY: Words matter. And Jeffrey argues Trump's words today set expectations tomorrow.\\n\\nJEFFREY: To throw out these general threats is inherently dangerous because if you become president, it's hard to back down on them.\\n\\nKELLY: Former U.S. diplomat Nicholas Burns says Iran's actions reveal internal battles in Tehran, divisions that play out in aggression towards the U.S.. Burns has served both Republican and Democratic presidents and now advises the Clinton campaign. He calls Trump's proposed response, quote, neither sophisticated nor sensible.\\n\\nNICHOLAS BURNS: Obviously, if Iranian naval vessels exhibited a lethal threat, an imminent threat to an American naval vessel, we would have every right to respond and to counterattack. But it hasn't come to that.\\n\\nKELLY: It's worth noting China plays the cat and mouse game, too. So does Russia. Last week, a Russian fighter jet came within 10 feet of a U.S. Navy plane over the Black Sea. The question, for whoever is elected America's next president, is do you go to war over provocations?

{"original": "Disaster Agency To Weather Hurricane Season With No Leader, Proposed Cuts\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\\n\\nForecasters say the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which begins Thursday, could bring above-normal storm activity. Residents along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are making sure they have supplies and plans in place if a storm hits.\\n\\nBut this year there are concerns that the federal agencies in charge of dealing with disasters — from providing emergency relief to rebuilding homes — may be less prepared than usual and could be hampered by proposed budget cuts.\\n\\nLast year provided a reminder of why many say federal assistance is vital. In October, Matthew slammed into Haiti as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 500. After that, it swept up the U.S. Atlantic coast, pounding communities like St. Augustine, Fla., where beaches were washed away and much of the downtown was underwater.\\n\\nEight months after the storm, St. Augustine and surrounding communities are still recovering, spending millions to rebuild the coastline. The emergency manager of St. John's County, Linda Stoughton, says federal support for that effort is vital. We understand disasters are local, Stoughton says. We responded. But we are going to need federal funding to make St. John's County back to where it was.\\n\\nThis year, key federal agencies that state and local governments and the public depend on still don't have leaders. Nearly five months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, NOAA, the agency that oversees the government's weather forecasting, is still without an administrator, as is the agency that responds to disasters, FEMA.\\n\\nAt least in the case of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a nomination is pending. The Trump administration has named the former head of Alabama's emergency management agency, Brock Long, to the position.\\n\\nFEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security. After touring the National Hurricane Center in Miami Thursday, DHS Secretary John Kelly said Long should be confirmed as early as next week and that he is not concerned about FEMA's ability to respond to disasters. We are ready to assist any state, any catastrophe, certainly in the case of Florida, hurricanes, he said. So we're ready to go with it. FEMA is ready, leaning forward.\\n\\nFEMA's last director, Craig Fugate, who stepped down in January, says day-to-day operations at the agency are in good hands, so he is not concerned about a temporary vacuum at the top. He says, The bigger challenge is longer term, is setting the tone and direction of the agency; being able to represent the agency in the policy discussions at the highest level of government.\\n\\nWith no permanent administrator in place for those discussions, FEMA is one of the agencies that have been targeted for significant cuts under the budget the president submitted to Congress. Under that budget, a program that helps states and communities take long-term measures to reduce losses from disasters, the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program, has been cut by more than 60 percent. The budget also eliminates funding for an ongoing effort to improve and redraw the nation's flood maps.\\n\\nThis is a very harmful approach that's essentially saying that states are on their own, communities are on their own in terms of responding and recovering from these disasters, says Rachel Cleetus, a climate policy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists. And the reality is, states just don't have the budgets.\\n\\nFor states and communities hit by floods, tornadoes, wildfires and other disasters, the Trump budget slashes another important source of recovery funds. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides money that helps communities rebuild after a disaster, after FEMA has moved on. The Trump budget cuts that $3 billion fund to zero. Cleetus says the HUD funding has been a lifesaver to communities around the country. It was certainly used after Katrina, she says. It was used after Sandy. Most recently it was used last year, after Hurricane Matthew. St. John's County received more than $48 million from HUD after Matthew, money that is helping rebuild roads and some of the 1,400 homes affected by the storm.\\n\\nAsked about the proposed budget cuts for FEMA, Kelly said tersely, We'll make do. And, as alarming as she finds it, Cleetus acknowledges that Trump's budget is unlikely to be adopted. Congress, not the president, determines how money is allocated to federal agencies. Fugate says FEMA has enjoyed stable funding since 2011 under a formula developed by Congress and the White House after Hurricane Irene. So despite the cuts to his former agency, Fugate says, I don't get too excited when the president submits their budget. I wait until I start seeing what the appropriations chairs have to work with and what their initial marks are. Because that's a better indicator of what ultimately will get funded or not get funded.\\n\\nFEMA, like many other federal agencies, is likely to be squeezed, Fugate says. But the agency, its mission and its funding have broad bipartisan support among members of Congress — especially those from communities where FEMA has helped pick up the pieces."}
{"original": "Hillary Clinton Outlines Economic Policy In Rebuttal To Donald Trump\\n\\nHillary Clinton's economic speech Thursday in Michigan is intended to be a rejoinder to Donald Trump's earlier address on the same subject in the same state.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nHillary Clinton delivered a major speech about her plans for the economy today. Donald Trump did the same thing on Monday. And as NPR's Tamara Keith tells us, the speeches show just how differently the two presidential candidates see the state of the nation.\\n\\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: The advantage of giving your big economic policy speech second is you know what the other guy said. From beginning to end, Clinton's speech was a rebuttal of Trump's both in tone and in substance. Trump started his speech in Detroit on Monday talking about all that is wrong with the city. Clinton speaking 10 miles away in Warren, Mich., saw things differently.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON: He talked only of failure, poverty and crime. He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great.\\n\\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nKEITH: Clinton delivered his speech at a company called Futuramic Tool and Engineering. Trump talks about bringing back the steel mills, many of which have been shuttered for more than a generation, while Clinton emphasizes advanced manufacturing, a growing sector in the U.S. economy. Futuramic, she said, had faced a choice as the auto industry's struggle started hurting its business and it chose to adjust into aerospace.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: And what I believe with all my heart is that what's happening here can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. We are builders, and we need to get back to building.\\n\\nKEITH: She talked about the incentives and tax changes she's proposed to keep American companies from moving their operations overseas. And Clinton went through a lengthy list of other economic policy ideas she's proposed during the campaign, from profit sharing to paid family leave.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: I imagine some of you might be thinking, well, that all sounds good, but what about trade? After all, Trump talks about it all the time.\\n\\nKEITH: Donald Trump has made opposing trade deals like NAFTA and the yet-to-be-enacted Trans-Pacific Partnership a centerpiece of his economic populist pitch to voters, especially in Rust Belt states where he will need to perform well if he's going to win in November. And Clinton delivered her strongest statements yet on TPP.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this. I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: I oppose it now. I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.\\n\\nKEITH: Clinton has said she opposes the TPP in its current form since October of last year, but recently a political ally said she would likely implement it as president, which the campaign immediately tamped down. Clinton seemed to echo Trump's message on China, offering tough words on its currency manipulation. But she saved her toughest critique for her opponent, saying Trump was trading on fear and isolationism.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: Now, before he tweets...\\n\\nCLINTON: Clinton always gets a rise out of the crowd when she mentions Trump's twitter habits.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: ...About how he's really the one who will put America first in trade, let's remember where Trump makes many of his own products because it sure is not America.\\n\\nKEITH: What Clinton attempted to do with this speech was take Trump's populist economic message and say that while what he was proposing sounded good, it was actually designed to help the rich and powerful like himself.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: I'm running for president to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And...\\n\\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: ...Based on what we know from the Trump campaign, he wants America to work for him and his friends at the expense of everyone else.\\n\\nKEITH: Presidential campaigns are often battled over convincing voters who really has their best interests at heart. Until recently, the image Trump created of a blue-collar billionaire coming to the rescue put him solidly ahead of Clinton on the question of who voters trust more to handle the economy. But with this speech and her near constant criticism of Trump's business practices, Clinton is hoping to make his one-time strength a weakness. Tamara Keith, NPR News.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Expected To Restrict Trade, Travel With Cuba\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Javier Galeano/AP Javier Galeano/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 8:19 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump is preparing to announce changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, possibly tightening restrictions on travel and trade that were loosened under former President Barack Obama.\\n\\nTrump is expected to announce the changes in Miami on Friday.\\n\\nThe move was confirmed by a congressional source with direct knowledge of the situation.\\n\\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been leading the push for a more restrictive policy, along with his fellow Cuban-American, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.\\n\\nThe changes could make it more difficult for Americans to visit the island and for U.S. companies to do business there. The Obama administration ended decades of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba, in hopes that renewed engagement would lead to reforms in the communist country.\\n\\nThe White House declined to discuss the pending changes.\\n\\nWhen we have an announcement on the president's schedule, we'll let you know, said spokesman Sean Spicer. But just stay tuned.\\n\\nAdvocates for greater engagement with Cuba warn the administration's changes could be costly.\\n\\nThis is the opposite of 'America First.' This is America last, said James Williams, who leads the nonpartisan lobbying group Engage Cuba.\\n\\nHe warns that reduced travel and trade with Cuba could cost thousands of American jobs.\\n\\nTravel to the island is already limited to visitors in 12 authorized categories, but there is little enforcement. And with renewed commercial air service, visits to Cuba have soared.\\n\\nThe administration is considering stepped up policing to discourage pleasure travel and limiting visitors to one trip per year.\\n\\nWilliams says that would be especially hard on Cuban-Americans with relatives on the island.\\n\\nImagine, your mother is sick in Cuba, Williams said. You might have to decide between going to see her in the hospital bed before she dies or going to the funeral. And that is just tragic.\\n\\nPolls suggest a majority of Americans support greater engagement with Cuba. Last month, 55 senators sponsored legislation that would further relax travel restrictions.\\n\\nThe opening has also led to modest changes in Cuba, with increased revenue for small-business owners and Internet hot spots in Havana.\\n\\nI think Cubans in Cuba will be terribly disheartened by the renewed restrictions, said Carlos Gutierrez, who served as commerce secretary under former President George W. Bush. This decision will not play well anywhere, except for in those very cloistered spots in South Florida where Sen. Rubio and Mario Diaz-Balart have constituents.\\n\\nShortly before Trump's inauguration, Rubio said in a statement that he was heartened the new administration would reverse the failed Cuba policy of the last two years.\\n\\nWhen the Obama administration policy was first rolled out in late 2014, Rubio blasted the move.\\n\\nJust as when President Eisenhower severed diplomatic relations with Cuba, the Castro family still controls the country, the economy and all levers of power. This administration's attempts to loosen restrictions on travel in recent years have only served to benefit the regime, he said in a statement. But most importantly, the regime's brutal treatment of the Cuban people has continued unabated. Dissidents are harassed, imprisoned and even killed."}
{"original": "Union Pushing Keystone XL Faces Racial Discrimination Suit\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Nash/AP Al Nash/AP\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is under pressure to walk away from his pledge to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justine Trudeau said completing the project is a key priority for him.\\n\\nOn this side of the border, one of the unions that want Biden to allow construction on the pipeline to continue is an Oklahoma local with a history of racism and sexism.\\n\\nPipeliners Local 798 faces a new class-action lawsuit that claims Black members were denied promotions that were given instead to less-qualified white coworkers.\\n\\nThe Pipeliners union is a powerful force in pipeline construction. With more than 8,000 members it works on pipeline construction projects across the country and has been a vocal supporter of the Keystone XL.\\n\\nThe union's history is relevant to Biden's position on the pipeline because environmental justice is a centerpiece of the president-elect's plan to address climate change. Biden vowed to protect communities of color that are disproportionately harmed by pollution and ensure people of color are given preferential treatment in developing clean energy jobs.\\n\\nThe plaintiff in this newest lawsuit, which was filed in November, is a Georgia man named Rodney Jones. His attorney says he's not commenting on the case as it proceeds through the court system.\\n\\nThe complaint, filed in federal court in Tulsa, says Jones worked as a welder helper for the union in 2019 and was subjected to racial slurs and jokes from white coworkers. The complaint says when Jones tried to advance to the journeyman level, he was denied that opportunity while less-qualified white workers were allowed.\\n\\nAnother Black member of the union named in the case, J.M. McIntosh, says a white colleague threw a rock at him partially blinding him in the eye. In the complaint, McIntosh says fellow union members refused to take him to the hospital, while a white welder with a similar injury was taken to a doctor immediately several days earlier.\\n\\nWe're confident in the facts that will be presented. We're passionate about the cause... And we're happy to represent these people and to help them find some justice if we're able, says attorney Matt Miller-Novak.\\n\\nThe company building the Keystone XL pipeline was quick to respond to allegations made against one of the unions that would get work building the project.\\n\\nWe have no tolerance for racism in our company. Inclusion and diversity are at the heart of who we are and embedded in our core values, TC Energy Spokesperson Terry Cunha tells NPR.\\n\\nLocal 798 is part of a national union, the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, which signed a labor agreement with the company last year. The local has lobbied for the pipeline as part of its effort to secure more work for its members.\\n\\nPipeliners Local 798 did not respond to NPR's request to comment on the case. But in 2017 Business Manager Danny Hendrix told NPR his union has a clear policy prohibiting discrimination.\\n\\nAt that time, NPR reported that for about 20 years Local 798 was under a strict oversight of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The union was forced to actively recruit and admit women and African-Americans. In the court case leading to that oversight, federal court Judge H. Dale Cook noted in his decision that there were no black members and there were no female members until the eve of the trial, May 1986, when Local 798 admitted a woman into the membership.\\n\\nThe EEOC ended its oversight in 2007 but members continued to experience racism that included things like nooses left at work sites where Black workers could find them and racial slurs scrawled on pipelines.\\n\\nThree decades later, when NPR pointed out to Hendrix that his entire leadership team continues to be all white men Hendrix said, The cream always comes to the top and I've surrounded myself by some of the best leaders in the pipeline industry. Are they white? They just happen to be, yes.\\n\\nEnvironmental groups that have long opposed the Keystone XL pipeline were quick to criticize the Pipeliners union.\\n\\nReports of racial discrimination within the oil industry is unsurprising given the history of violence and racism in how fossil fuel corporations have pushed dirty pipeline projects through Indigenous, Black, low income communities of color, poisoning their water and land for profit, said Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Director, at 350.org.\\n\\nOn Monday TC Energy announced it would power pumping stations along the Keystone XL with renewable electricity by 2030. It was an apparent bid to save the project as it was widely reported in Canada that Biden was preparing to withdraw a presidential permit needed to continue construction.\\n\\nEmissions from operating the pipeline are not what's controversial. Instead it's the oil sands crude the pipeline would carry from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. What critics call tar sands oil emits more of the greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change because it needs more processing to make it usable.\\n\\nThe 1,700-mile, $8 billion pipeline that would carry oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast was first proposed in 2008 and rejected by the Obama administration, and then revived under President Trump.\\n\\nThe union has not yet responded to the initial complaint, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages but does not name a specific amount. While it's not clear how many black members of the union might be represented in the case, attorneys estimate it is more than 500."}
{"original": "Israeli Human Rights Group Says The Country Pursues Nondemocratic 'Apartheid Regime'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mahmoud Illean/AP Mahmoud Illean/AP\\n\\nA prominent Israeli human rights group has intensified its criticism of the country's policies toward Palestinians, saying Israel pursues a nondemocratic apartheid regime and Jewish supremacy in both Israel and the Palestinian territories.\\n\\nThe report Tuesday by B'Tselem reflects a recent shift by critics within Israel, widening their focus beyond the country's half-century military occupation of Palestinian territories to policies stretching back to Israel's founding, and endorsing highly charged parallels to South Africa's former regime of white rule.\\n\\nMany Israelis firmly reject the comparison. They boast of a vibrant Israeli democracy, say Palestinians have representation in their own semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, and justify restrictions on Palestinians as necessary security measures in the absence of peace.\\n\\nB'Tselem's director Hagai El-Ad, who is Jewish, said he hoped the report would inform the analysis of the incoming Biden administration as it considers how to steer U.S. policy, after the Trump administration sided with Israel and against Palestinian positions on the most sensitive aspects of the long-running conflict between the two peoples.\\n\\nI expect this will be part of a new chapter for fighting for justice in this place, El-Ad said.\\n\\nB'Tselem, which has documented Israeli human rights abuses in Palestinian territories since 1989, said it now rejects the commonly held notion that Israel maintains two separate regimes side-by-side: a democracy inside Israel, where the country's 20% Palestinian Arab minority shares equal citizenship and rights with its Jewish majority, and a military occupation imposed on Palestinian non-citizens in territories captured in 1967 which Palestinians seek for an independent state.\\n\\nThe group's eight-page report instead asserts that one unequal system governs Israel, Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\\n\\nOne organizing principle lies at the base of a wide array of Israeli policies: advancing and perpetuating the supremacy of one group – Jews – over another – Palestinians, B'Tselem said in a statement Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Israeli government did not issue an immediate public response, but defenders of Israeli policy accused B'Tselem of radicalized anti-Israel propaganda.\\n\\nThis is no longer the same NGO that once gained respect, even from critics, by championing human rights based on credible research. Today, it is a platform for demonizers, Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor, an Israeli watchdog of pro-Palestinian groups, said in a statement.\\n\\nB'Tselem seeks to fundamentally delegitimize Israel and call for its destruction - because one does not reform an Apartheid regime, one ends it, said Eugene Kontorovich of the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Israeli think tank.\\n\\nAnother prominent Israeli advocate for Palestinian rights, lawyer Michael Sfard, issued a legal opinion last year that Israelis practice apartheid over Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but he stopped short of evaluating whether the same definition applied within Israel proper.\\n\\nB'Tselem said Palestinian Arab citizens in Israel have more rights than non-citizens in the West Bank and Gaza but that they were second-class citizens to Jewish Israelis. It pointed to Israel's construction of hundreds of Jewish communities while building few communities for the country's Palestinian citizens; and laws that grant automatic Israeli citizenship to Jews around the world but exclude non-Jews, including Palestinians.\\n\\nB'Tselem's criticisms of Israel's military occupation include travel restrictions placed on Palestinians, who require Israeli travel permits; and Palestinians' lack of voting rights in the Israeli political system which holds sway over their lives.\\n\\nB'Tselem said it decided to embrace the apartheid terminology following the adoption in 2018 of Israel's Nation State Law, which defined Israel as a Jewish state and accorded Jews priority in areas ranging from the official use of Hebrew versus Arabic, to land development, to the government's discussion last year of potentially annexing occupied West Bank territory without extending voting rights to Palestinians living there, a move Israel says is possible.\\n\\nIsrael is not a democracy that has a temporary occupation attached to it: it is one regime between the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and we must look at the full picture and see it for what it is: apartheid, El-Ad said.\\n\\nThe human rights group's name, B'Tselem, Hebrew for In the Image, is taken from Genesis 1:27 which states that humanity was created in the image of God."}
{"original": "Bernie Sanders Says He'll Vote For Clinton (Still No Endorsement, Though)\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP\\n\\nBernie Sanders said he'll vote for Hillary Clinton in November — but more than two weeks after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sanders remains in the race.\\n\\nSanders was on MSNBC when Nicolle Wallace, a former Republican aide and now network political analyst, asked Sanders, Are you going to vote for Hillary Clinton in November?\\n\\nHis answer: Yes.\\n\\nHe added, The issue right here is, I think I am going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump.\\n\\nBut Sanders did not concede to or praise Clinton, something many Democrats would like to see before the Democratic National Convention next month to fully unify the party heading into the heat of the fall campaign.\\n\\ntoggle caption Berniesanders.com\\n\\nSanders went on to criticize Trump and said his job now is to fight for the strongest possible Democratic Party platform. Sanders' campaign manager has previously said there was no active effort to flip superdelegates, and Sanders himself gave another sign that he recognized the end was near when he told C-SPAN that it doesn't appear he would be the nominee.\\n\\nSanders' campaign is encouraging supporters to weigh in on a long list of potential priorities to be included in the party platform. That list includes 24 items, everything from break up too big to fail financial institutions to eliminate the death penalty.\\n\\nAsked in a CBS This Morning interview why he hasn't yet endorsed Clinton, Sanders replied, Because I haven't heard her say the things I need to hear said.\\n\\nPressed by anchor Charlie Rose on what he needs to hear, Sanders said he wants Clinton to call for public universities and colleges to be tuition-free and to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. These are two areas where Sanders and Clinton disagree, but only by degree.\\n\\nClinton is advocating debt-free public college, and she says she thinks the federal minimum-wage should be raised to $12 an hour while states and cities could raise it to $15 on their own, as some are already doing.\\n\\nCompare that with Trump, who: believes the Department of Education, which gives federal aid, should be largely eliminated; calls for privatizing student loans and incentivizing the kinds of college majors that are proven to make more money; and has waffled on the minimum wage.\\n\\nHe had said in a November debate of the current $7.25 federal wage, I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. Yet, last month, he said he was open to doing something about the wage because he's very different from most Republicans. But it's unclear what Trump would do exactly. There is no policy position on his website relating to education or the minimum wage in any way.\\n\\nOn CNN later, Sanders was even more noncommittal on Clinton, saying, in all likelihood his vote will be Hillary Clinton. He was pressed on that choice of words. Sanders said he didn't want to parse words but then went on to rattle off issues he believed in that the party should adopt.\\n\\nSanders is continuing to campaign, though it is not entirely clear what the goal is — perhaps to build momentum and pressure for the platform. There are no more primaries. On Thursday night, Sanders gave a more than hourlong speech in New York, where he didn't once mention Clinton. On Friday afternoon, he is scheduled to hold a Future to Believe in rally in Syracuse, N.Y.\\n\\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Watch: Sen. McCain Calls For Compromise In Return To Senate Floor\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., returned to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday after a brain cancer diagnosis to help Republican leadership begin debate on health care. But after casting his vote in favor of debate, McCain took the floor and said he would not vote for the current health bill, the latest product of a controversial and contentious process in which Republicans have been at odds with one another as well as with Democrats.\\n\\nMcCain called for a return to regular order in the Senate, urging his colleagues to move toward compromise and an open legislative process.\\n\\nOur responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all, he said. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America's problems and defend her from her adversaries.\\n\\nHere is a video and his full remarks, as provided by the senator's office:\\n\\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\\n\\nMr. President:\\n\\nI've stood in this place many times and addressed as president many presiding officers. I have been so addressed when I have sat in that chair, as close as I will ever be to a presidency.\\n\\nIt is an honorific we're almost indifferent to, isn't it. In truth, presiding over the Senate can be a nuisance, a bit of a ceremonial bore, and it is usually relegated to the more junior members of the majority.\\n\\nBut as I stand here today – looking a little worse for wear I'm sure – I have a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of this body, and for the other ninety-nine privileged souls who have been elected to this Senate.\\n\\nI have been a member of the United States Senate for thirty years. I had another long, if not as long, career before I arrived here, another profession that was profoundly rewarding, and in which I had experiences and friendships that I revere. But make no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege – for the honor – of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love.\\n\\nI've known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of American politics. They came from both parties, and from various backgrounds. Their ambitions were frequently in conflict. They held different views on the issues of the day. And they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest.\\n\\nBut they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively. Our responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our Republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America's problems and to defend her from her adversaries.\\n\\nThat principled mindset, and the service of our predecessors who possessed it, come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the world's greatest deliberative body. I'm not sure we can claim that distinction with a straight face today.\\n\\nI'm sure it wasn't always deserved in previous eras either. But I'm sure there have been times when it was, and I was privileged to witness some of those occasions.\\n\\nOur deliberations today – not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities – authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role – are often lively and interesting. They can be sincere and principled. But they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we'd all agree they haven't been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren't producing much for the American people.\\n\\nBoth sides have let this happen. Let's leave the history of who shot first to the historians. I suspect they'll find we all conspired in our decline – either by deliberate actions or neglect. We've all played some role in it. Certainly I have. Sometimes, I've let my passion rule my reason. Sometimes, I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy.\\n\\nIncremental progress, compromises that each side criticize but also accept, just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and keep our enemies from doing their worst isn't glamorous or exciting. It doesn't feel like a political triumph. But it's usually the most we can expect from our system of government, operating in a country as diverse and quarrelsome and free as ours.\\n\\nConsidering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic governments, and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem solving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, and the liberty and justice it preserves, is a magnificent achievement.\\n\\nOur system doesn't depend on our nobility. It accounts for our imperfections, and gives an order to our individual strivings that has helped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth. It is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than 'winning.' Even when we must give a little to get a little. Even when our efforts manage just three yards and a cloud of dust, while critics on both sides denounce us for timidity, for our failure to 'triumph.'\\n\\nI hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.\\n\\nLet's trust each other. Let's return to regular order. We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That's an approach that's been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.\\n\\nWe're getting nothing done. All we've really done this year is confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Our healthcare insurance system is a mess. We all know it, those who support Obamacare and those who oppose it. Something has to be done. We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. We haven't found it yet, and I'm not sure we will. All we've managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn't very popular when we started trying to get rid of it.\\n\\nI voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today. It's a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my state's governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it.\\n\\nWe've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.\\n\\nThe Obama administration and congressional Democrats shouldn't have forced through Congress without any opposition support a social and economic change as massive as Obamacare. And we shouldn't do the same with ours.\\n\\nWhy don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. If this process ends in failure, which seem likely, then let's return to regular order.\\n\\nLet the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray hold hearings, try to report a bill out of committee with contributions from both sides. Then bring it to the floor for amendment and debate, and see if we can pass something that will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side, but that might provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today.\\n\\nWhat have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? We're not getting much done apart. I don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people.\\n\\nThe Senate is capable of that. We know that. We've seen it before. I've seen it happen many times. And the times when I was involved even in a modest way with working out a bipartisan response to a national problem or threat are the proudest moments of my career, and by far the most satisfying.\\n\\nThis place is important. The work we do is important. Our strange rules and seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and insist on our cooperation are important. Our founders envisioned the Senate as the more deliberative, careful body that operates at a greater distance than the other body from the public passions of the hour.\\n\\nWe are an important check on the powers of the Executive. Our consent is necessary for the President to appoint jurists and powerful government officials and in many respects to conduct foreign policy. Whether or not we are of the same party, we are not the President's subordinates. We are his equal!\\n\\nAs his responsibilities are onerous, many and powerful, so are ours. And we play a vital role in shaping and directing the judiciary, the military, and the cabinet, in planning and supporting foreign and domestic policies. Our success in meeting all these awesome constitutional obligations depends on cooperation among ourselves.\\n\\nThe success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America. This country – this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good and magnificent country – needs us to help it thrive. That responsibility is more important than any of our personal interests or political affiliations.\\n\\nWe are the servants of a great nation, 'a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.' More people have lived free and prosperous lives here than in any other nation. We have acquired unprecedented wealth and power because of our governing principles, and because our government defended those principles.\\n\\nAmerica has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an international order that has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, the greatest supporter and the greatest defender of that order. We aren't afraid. We don't covet other people's land and wealth. We don't hide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity.\\n\\nWhat greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal justice? That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small differences that divide us.\\n\\nWhat a great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in this body.\\n\\nIt's a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it. Many of you have reached out in the last few days with your concern and your prayers, and it means a lot to me. It really does. I've had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else.

{"original": "Pope Benedict's Complex Role In Abuse Scandal\\n\\nIn his papacy, Pope Benedict has been the first pope to break the Vatican's wall of silence on this issue. Still, Allen allows that whether the Pope has done enough is a matter of fair debate.\\n\\nBut after Pope John Paul II put Cardinal Ratzinger and his office in charge of the abuse complaints in 2001, Allen says he began to talk much more openly about what he described as 'filth' in the Catholic Church, and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers.\\n\\nPrior to 2001, Allen tells host Neal Conan of then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,in the very few public statements he had made about this crisis, he came off, to be frank, as just another Roman cardinal in denial.\\n\\nJohn Allen, senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, says the Pope isn't just part of the problem, but also an important part of the solution. His op-ed,  A Papal Conversion , appeared in the New York Times.\\n\\nRevelations that Pope Benedict XVI failed to do anything about reports of sexual abuse by priests years ago have raised questions about how much he knew, and when.\\n\\nNEAL CONAN, host:\\n\\nTime now for the Opinion Page. The scandal over sexual abuse by priests and cover-ups by bishops erupted in this country 10 years ago. Now, there are similar charges from several countries in Europe that seem to place some responsibility and blame at the door of Pope Benedict XVI, as a bishop in his native Germany, later as a high-ranking Vatican official. But in an op-ed in the New York Times, John Allen, senior correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter, says before we rush to condemn the pope as part of the problem, we must first understand that he's also been part of the solution.\\n\\nCatholics in our audience, we'd like to hear from you today. Almost five years since he took office, has the pope done enough to clean up the church's sex abuse scandal? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our Web site. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.\\n\\nJohn Allen of the National Catholic Reporter joins us now by phone from his office in Denver. John, nice to have you back on the program.\\n\\nMr. JOHN ALLEN (Senior Correspondent, National Catholic Reporter): Hey, Neal. It's always a pleasure.\\n\\nCONAN: And you write that then-Cardinal Ratzinger experienced a conversion of sorts on this issue almost 10 years ago.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, one point that is often forgotten in this discussion - because in some reporting, it's been suggested that then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the guy who is now the pope was somehow the Vatican's point person on sex abuse for the entire arch of his 25-year career in Rome. And that's not really correct. In fact, he didn't get any direct responsibility for this until 2001, when Pope John Paul II put him and his office in charge of it.\\n\\nAnd by all accounts, it triggered what I have described - I mean, it's my language, not his - but what I've described as something of a conversion experience, because prior to 2001, in the very few public statements Cardinal Ratzinger had made about this crisis, he came off to be frank, as just another Roman cardinal in denial. But after 2001, when he actually had to sit down and read all the case files for every Catholic priest, everyone in the world who had credibly been accused of sexual abuse, he began to talk much more openly about what he described as filth in the Catholic Church and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers. And that has followed into his - flowed, rather, into his papacy, where we see him as the first pope to embrace a zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse, the first pope to meet with victims, the first pope to, in effect, break the Vatican's wall of silence on this issue.\\n\\nSo, look. I mean, whether he has done enough, I think, is a matter of fair debate, but I think what is inarguably is that he has at least done something, and by something I mean considerably more than any of his predecessors ever have on this issue.\\n\\nCONAN: And you also note - and I think any student of history would have to agree, the church's progress on almost any issue can be glacial to those of us on the outside.\\n\\n(Soundbite of laughter)\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, the saying around the Vatican is that they think in centuries. I mean, I have to sometimes joke that the working motto is talk to me on Wednesday, and I'll get back to you in 300 years.\\n\\nCONAN: Yeah.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Now, look. I mean, that's not to defend their slowness and ambivalence on this issue. I think - and quite honestly, you know, by contemporary 21st century standards, the response from Rome on this and many other things has been abysmally slow. But it is nevertheless to say that from the pope's own point of view, the kind of progress he's made on this issue in the last eight years is, by historical standards, quite remarkable.\\n\\nCONAN: And we hear the stories - and this happens to be the start of holy week. It happens to be the fifth anniversary of the death of Pope John Paul II, so there are issues that the Roman Catholics would rather focus on other than this crisis. But nevertheless, the crisis is not going to go away. But we keep hearing the stories of then-Bishop Ratzinger overlooking the parish priest in - back in Germany when he was responsible for this. And nevertheless, there are other stories that we don't hear so much about. If you would tell us how, as pope, he has handled an institution called the Legionaries of Christ.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Yeah. This is - I suppose for Catholic insiders, the Legionaries of Christ would be one of the more high-profile new religious orders in the Catholic Church, founded in the middle part of the 20th century and known for being very - or I should say fairly conservative and very loyal to the pope, loyal to the Vatican. The founder was a high-profile Mexican priest by the name of Father Marcial Maciel Degollado, who actually died in 2008. Father Maciel was one of these sort of charismatic figures who was very skilled at generating a following, and very skilled at ingratiating himself in senior levels in Rome.\\n\\nFor several decades, there had been sex abuse allegations lodged against him. One case filed under church law came from a handful of ex-members. And it went to then-Cardinal Ratzinger's office at the Vatican in the mid-'90s, where, essentially, the Vatican set on the allegation until 2001. After 2001, with this change I've described in Cardinal Ratzinger's attitude to this issue, they re-launched the investigation against Father Marcial. Even so, it was widely believed that nothing would happen to him, because Father Marcial was protected at the most senior levels of the church, all the way up to and including Pope John Paul II.\\n\\nSo that when Benedict was elected, a matter of just months after his election, in effect, the hammer came down. Father Marcial was taken out of priestly ministry and was instructed by the new pope to go live a life of prayer and penance. This is widely taken to be a finding of guilt. And, essentially, the conclusion that Catholic insiders drew from that episode is that even someone as prominent and well connected as Father Marcial - if even that guy is not safe under the new pope, then no one is. I mean, in other words, the conclusion was there's a new sheriff in town.\\n\\nCONAN: Now, let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. If there is indeed a new sheriff in town, is it too little too late - I guess, is the question we're asking. Let's go to Shawn(ph), Shawn with us from Fort Lauderdale.\\n\\nSHAWN (Caller): Yes. I was just wondering - it seems to me, I agree that the - this pope has been moving quickly, probably, for obvious reasons. My question is more throughout the world church. I know Mr. Allen is very familiar with what's going on in the church. Is this more of a problem, at this juncture, of looking back? In other words, we're looking at offenses, very grave offenses that occurred in the '50s, '60s, maybe into the '70s, and that we're not really talking about an ongoing problem. Is there - there's no widespread problem, or is there a widespread problem of abuse currently in the Catholic Church? And that's my question, and I can take my answer off the air.\\n\\nCONAN: All right, Shawn, thanks very much. John?\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Sure. Well, look. I think you can always find individual problems of abuse if you're looking around. But let me take a step back and say that I think from the beginning, what we now talk about is the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church has really been two interlocking, but distinct problems. There's the problem of priests who abused, and there's the problem of bishops who covered it up - that is, who should have known better and failed to act.\\n\\nNow, I think on that first problem - that is the need to adopt tough policies to try to prevent future acts of abuse - I think most people would give the Catholic Church, in general, and in this pope, in particular, fairly high marks. I mean, today, zero tolerance is more or less the official policy of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nToday, it is abundantly clear whether we're talking about Europe or North America or Africa or Latin America or wherever, it is abundantly clear that if a priest sexually abuses someone - and in particular, if he sexually abuses a minor child - that that priest is going to be immediately yanked out of the priesthood and he's also going to be turned over to the cops. So, in that sense, the church, I think, today is paying the price for failures in the past, as opposed to failures in the present.\\n\\nBut the other piece of the puzzle is, of course, what about senior management that allowed this to happen? That is, what about bishops who just drop the ball? Who - and in some cases, who overtly try to cover this up rather than deal with the problem? There, I think, a lot of people would say that that is the big piece of unfinished business from this crisis. And it's not clear what new accountability measures the church might be able to adopt to give some teeth to the idea of accountability for bishops. And that, frankly, is what makes these revelations about the pope's track record both as archbishop in Munich from '77 to '82, and also as a Vatican official.\\n\\nIt's what makes those revelations so explosive, because ultimately, what's at stake here is his moral authority to deal with this unfinished bit of business. Because what people will ask is: Is it credible to believe that Benedict can crack heads with other bishops if, at least prior to 2001, his own record really isn't any better? And that's the hard question the pope is going to have to answer.\\n\\nCONAN: Well, just continuing along the lines of the question, just the case of Father Marcial, the cases we've heard about - North America and Europe, for the most part - are people concerned that there may be other shoes ready to drop in South America, in Asia, in Africa?\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Oh, absolutely. Look. I mean, this crisis today has broken in - it broke first, really, in Canada in the late '90s, then Australia, the States, Ireland, to some extent the U.K., now Germany and some other places in Europe. And now that's a lengthening list of countries, obviously. But, I mean, let's bear in mind that two-thirds of the 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world today live in the Southern Hemisphere - that is Latin American, African, Asia. By mid-century, that'll bee three-quarters.\\n\\nBasically speaking, I think if we adopt the premise that this problem probably is a global Catholic problem - that is, it's no more likely to flare up in North America or Europe than it is in Latin America or sub-Saharan African - then the truth is, there's probably at least two-thirds of the Catholic world where this crisis has not yet erupted, but where it very well could. And so if I were in senior leadership in the Catholic Church today, if somebody were trying to tell me that we're rounding a corner, that this story is almost over, I would be deeply skeptical of that.\\n\\nCONAN: To your knowledge, are there efforts underway to, well, be a little more proactive this time around and unearth these problems before they come to light on their own?\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Neal, I think there are some bishops and some other church leaders who sort of on their own have taken it upon themselves to try to, in effect, to diffuse the bomb before it goes off - that is, who are well aware that this crisis could erupt in their zone of competence and who have tried to look into among their own, to establish what the record is, and to be transparent about it. And I certainly think anyone who has watched this crisis play out in other places ought to draw that conclusion, that it's far better for the church to get this out all at once and on its own terms rather than to suffer death by a thousand cuts.\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, I can also say that there is no formal policy, either from the Vatican or anyplace else, that instructs bishops to do that. So I would say that at the moment, it's sort of catch-as-catch-can. Some people are trying to get ahead of the curve, and others are simply holding their breath, hoping this won't happen to them.\\n\\nCONAN: John Allen of the National Catholic Reporter, also the author of The Rise of Benedict XVI. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.\\n\\nAnd let's get Mark on the line, Mark with us from Tulsa.\\n\\nMARK (Caller): Yes, hello. How are you?\\n\\nCONAN: Good, thanks.\\n\\nMARK: Great show, by the way. Mr. Allen, thank you for all your work.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Oh, you're very welcome, Mark. What's your question?\\n\\nMARK: A comment, more so. As a 30-year-old male from the Midwest - in Tulsa, specifically - of mixed ethnic background, many of us - we applaud the pope for what he has done, but it's all relative, more or less. When an institution, for centuries, has moved at a snail's pace and you're going to tell me that slightly faster than that is all we can do right now, we take what we can, but at the same time you throw your hands up in arms. Because as your guest just said, this has not erupted throughout two-thirds of the known Catholic world. And we look at Ireland, how that has flared up recently in the past year. We just dont know when it's going to end, or if it's even started, to tell you the truth.\\n\\nCONAN: There was - the pope did accept the resignation of one of the Irish bishops this past week.\\n\\nMARK: Yes, that's right. There are, basically speaking, now five Irish bishops who have offered their resignations in the wake of this crisis, two of which have been accepted, and the other three are sort of still waiting on the pope's desk for him to act.\\n\\nI mean, part of the problem here, Neal, is that on the one hand, it may well be the case that accountability is going to require more bishops to resign. On the other hand, there is a cultural and historical problem here, which is the Vatican never likes to see bishops step down under fire, because in their mind, thinking historically, this is an invitation for people to mount pressure campaigns to try to bring down bishops for various reasons. That makes them very uncomfortable, and this is what communist regimes try to do, and so on. And the Vatican, thinking globally and thinking historically, can't help flashing on those kinds of memories.\\n\\nIn addition, the Vatican has a whole another understanding of what accountability means in a case like this, because their theological model for understanding a bishop is not that he is the CEO of a corporation, but he's the father of a family. And as we would say with regular human families, you know, when things get tough, you don't tell the father to walk away. You tell him to, you know, try to solve the problem. That's their understanding of what accountability means.\\n\\nAnd so there's a lot that has to be weighted through there. But at the end of the day, I would say that in the court of popular opinion, this business of how do you hold bishops accountable for their failures, that would be the single most important bit of unfinished business from this crisis.\\n\\nCONAN: Mark, thanks very much for the call.\\n\\nMARK: Thank you both.\\n\\nCONAN: Let's go next to - this is Bette(ph), Bette with us from Grand Rapids.\\n\\nBETTE (Caller): Hello.\\n\\nCONAN: Hi, Bette. Go ahead, please.\\n\\nBETTE: About - I guess it was 1993 when I brought my case against the diocese here in Grand Rapids. I was molested by our parish priest when I was 12 and 13 years old. It went on for a year.\\n\\nCONAN: I'm so sorry.\\n\\nBETTE: I was one of several of his victims. And during the time that it was happening, there were several parents who tried to bring attention to what they thought was bad behavior on this priest's part. And the bishop, you know, ignored the problem, transferred him, and did all the things that they do. But I believe that the bishops do need to be held accountable, because when I brought my case forward, when I made my accusations, the bishop and the lawyers denied everything. They said that I was making things up, I had false memories, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd that went on for several, several months, until finally, the priest who molested me was put in front of a lie detector. And before he was hooked up to the machine, he confessed everything. He spent hours talking to the lie detector technician, confessing it all. And as it turned out, he had wanted to confess all along, but the lawyer and the bishop were sitting on him and insisting that what I was saying was all lies.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Bette...\\n\\nBETTE: I wound up on being successful in my suit, and by success I mean that I got - I didnt want him defrocked, because I was afraid that he would just go to another state and pick up work (unintelligible)...\\n\\nCONAN: Bette, we just have a few seconds left. I wanted to give John a chance to respond.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Well, Bette, actually, I wanted to ask you very, very quickly: When you say you want the bishop held accountable, what would that mean to you? What would accountability look like?\\n\\nBETTE: Well, what happens when a person commits perjury in a civil situation like that? If they're asked directly if these accusations are true and they say no and they know, in fact, otherwise, what happens in those cases?\\n\\nCONAN: That would be a criminal case.\\n\\nBETTE: Right.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: In other words, there would be some kind of criminal prosecution. Look, I - first of all, I'm dreadfully sorry for what happened to you, and I'm glad that, ultimately, you are able to prevail. I don't know exactly what should happen, because I know that the Vatican has to set policy for a global church. But I do know that when I talk to just ordinary people, the kinds of disappointment that Bette is describing, particularly about how the bishops seem - how the church seems to have dealt with its priest problem, but not its bishop's problem - that, to me, does seem to be the single biggest sort of neuralgic point in all of this. And somehow...\\n\\nCONAN: And I'm afraid we're...\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: ...it's a question the pope is going to have to answer.\\n\\nCONAN: Beth, thank you very much for the call. And I'm sorry to cut this short, but we're running out of time. And John Allen, thank you for your time today.\\n\\nMr. ALLEN: Neal, great pleasure.\\n\\nCONAN: John Allen of the National Catholic Reporter.\\n\\nThis is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.

{"original": "Heavy Student Loan Debt Forces Many Millennials To Delay Buying Homes\\n\\nEnlarge this image Jon Marchione for NPR Jon Marchione for NPR\\n\\nStudent loan debt in the United States has more than doubled over the past decade to about $1.5 trillion, and the Federal Reserve now estimates that it is cutting into millennials' ability to buy homes.\\n\\nHomeownership rates for people ages 24 to 32 dropped nearly 9 percentage points between 2005 and 2014 — effectively driving down homeownership rates overall. In January, the Fed estimated 20 percent of that decline is attributable to student loan debt.\\n\\nWhether that will shift with time as the millennial generation marries and has children is the big economic question.\\n\\nThat's also a big question for Michael McHale, who says as a child, he pictured a suburban, picket-fenced home he eventually wanted to own. I can remember wanting that since I was 6, 7 or 8, he says.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Michael McHale Courtesy of Michael McHale\\n\\nBut at age 31, McHale isn't living that dream. Instead, he and his wife rent in Danbury, Conn., an hour's drive from the elementary school where he teaches, across the state line in New York.\\n\\nNot owning a home makes him feel he has made a mistake that has kept him short of a key milestone — and his piece of the American dream. McHale says he feels trapped by his and his wife's combined $1,200 monthly student loan bills, which prevent them from saving enough for a down payment.\\n\\nAnd he says renting means he isn't free to plan his life, even as their first child — a boy — is on the way. One example: decorating the baby's nursery. We can't really make any actual changes. We can't really paint too much, McHale says.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here\\n\\nIt seems like there's like a debt spiral or something. When you get into a little bit of it, it just feeds back in on itself, and for us that started with student loans — that was our first debt, he says.\\n\\nIt feels especially bad when he compares himself with his father's generation. Neither his father nor his uncles were burdened by student loans. They all owned a house and had their full-time jobs by the time they were like 21, McHale says.\\n\\nYet many economists say this younger generation will eventually be able to buy — just later than previous generations.\\n\\nIt's not that they're not going to buy homes. It's just that they'll purchase these homes later in life, says Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm First American.\\n\\nBaby boomers were 25, on average, when they purchased their first homes; millennials, by comparison, are waiting almost a decade longer, Kushi says.\\n\\nMany factors are contributing to this delay: People are staying in school longer, delaying marriage and having children later. This generation is just starting to buy homes, and Kushi expects to see a wave of young buyers in coming years.\\n\\nThis generation will still yield the wealth benefits from becoming a homeowner, which I think is the key point, she says.\\n\\nThis might already be starting to happen.\\n\\nIn the past two years, homeownership rates have increased largely because of young buyers, who are benefiting from the good economy, says Jonathan Spader, a researcher at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\\n\\nStudent loan debt is still a headwind, but they're at least being buoyed by stronger incomes and employment, he says.\\n\\nPeople with degrees have higher incomes, which offset the debt burden. But it's also true that people are taking longer to get their degrees, and many don't finish school.\\n\\nApproximately 40 percent of those who start college do not finish within six years. ... That's a huge number, says Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\\n\\nFor those people, it is the worst of all worlds — they have the school debt without the higher wages to show for it.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Christina Ward Courtesy of Christina Ward\\n\\nChristina Ward did finish her schooling, but her chosen profession in social work doesn't pay enough for her to overcome her student debt.\\n\\nI thought that I would be able to at least make enough money to make the payments, which wasn't true at all, she says.\\n\\nWard racked up nearly $200,000 in loans for college and graduate school. Then she was laid off in December. At 36, she moved back into her parents' apartment in Newark, N.J.\\n\\nWard says she and her girlfriend have had to postpone not just buying a house; her girlfriend is also putting off her graduate education.\\n\\nWe definitely wanted to get married, and that's probably going to end up taking priority over the house, because you can't afford both, Ward says.\\n\\nBut at the moment, there's no target date for getting married either."}
{"original": "The International Implications Of Trump's Refugee Ban\\n\\nLulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations, and author of A World in Disarray, about the foreign-policy effects of Trump's executive order.\\n\\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nRefugees and other foreigners were held at airports across the country yesterday as President Trump's executive order went into effect. By the evening, a federal judge in Brooklyn had issued an emergency stay on a part of the president's actions. That stay prevents the deportation of anyone with a valid visa after they have landed in the U.S.\\n\\nThat's a lot to keep track of, so I'm going to recap. President Trump's orders prevent all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely and prevents people from seven Muslim-majority countries from coming here for three months - on that list Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\\n\\nHere to talk about some of the foreign policy implications is Richard Haass. He's head of the Council on Foreign Relations. And his new book is, A World In Disarray.\\n\\nThanks for being with us.\\n\\nRICHARD HAASS: Good morning.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Good morning. President Trump's executive actions on immigrants and refugees, it feels like a fundamental reset of how this nation views its borders. When you saw the news, what were your thoughts?\\n\\nHAASS: Well, I was both surprised and unhappy - surprised because I don't always assume that everything said on a campaign becomes policy. And often, for good reason, it does not. But disappointed - beyond the humanitarian costs that you've been talking about this morning, this is - you know, it's bad for American universities. It's bad for the American economy. A lot of these people, you know, who are here already or who would come here would fill our schools, would work for our major technology and other firms.\\n\\nBut the foreign policy side of this is what worries me as much of anything. You're really letting down those people, say, in Iraq, who risked their lives to work to help Americans. This seems to me as not just personally unfair to them but sends a terrible message that those who work with us will not necessarily be protected. I think, also, if you're ISIS, this is a good day. This is a recruiting boon for you. It basically sends the message, the Americans are at war with Islam, just as we, ISIS, have been saying all along.\\n\\nAnd lastly, I worry about the implications for America's 3 million Muslims. By essentially dealing with people not as people but as members of religious groups or people who come from certain countries, I'm worried this will alienate this community. We need them to be fully integrated in this society. We need their leaders, basically, to work with law enforcement to identify, in particular, those young people who do get radicalized. And what I fear this will do is actually increase the alienation and radicalization of this community. So the homegrown terrorist threat, which I worry far more about than anyone coming in from across our borders, that threat could actually get worse.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's important to say at this point that the Trump administration says this is not a religious ban. This is not a ban on Muslims. This is to protect the country from terrorism. When we look at our foreign policy, we've already seen reaction from around the Middle East. What do you think the effect is going to be in places like Iran and Iraq?\\n\\nHAASS: Well, it won't - none of this will change the dynamics of what is going on in places like Iran and Iraq. Iraq is, you know, fighting ISIS. The government there is what it is. But Iran - and again, none of this will affect the Iranian nuclear program or Iran's push for regional primacy. Those are some of the reasons the Middle East is as turbulent as it is. But I think, again, it's a powerful propaganda tool for a country like Iran. What it says - the United States is implacably hostile to Muslims. I think it makes it more difficult, in some ways, for us to get Iraqis to work with us. The bottom line is I don't see how it helps us to stabilize this part of the world.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: This is part of what President Trump has called America first and America-first position in the world. What are the risks of this kind of isolationist, it seems, position?\\n\\nHAASS: It's not just isolationist, America first - it sends the signal that the United States is going to narrow and calculate its self-interest. And we're simply not going to care about what it might mean for other people or other countries. So here, we're seeing the humanitarian crisis, but we're also going to see other countries taking matters into their own hands.\\n\\nAnd they're going to stop deferring to American interests. They're either going to defer to the most powerful regional state, or they're going to increasingly arm themselves and do what they narrowly think they need to do. This is a world with much less American influence. This leads to a world with much less order. Yeah, I've written about a world in disarray. We could go from a world in disarray to something even worse all too quickly.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Richard Haass, head of the Council on Foreign Relations, his new book is A World In Disarray, as he just mentioned.

{"original": "Presidential Candidates Address AIPAC Policy Conference\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nThe nation's largest pro-Israel political organization is hearing from U.S. presidential candidates today. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as AIPAC, is holding its annual conference in Washington. This morning, Democrat Hillary Clinton delivered a speech with several thinly veiled attacks on Donald Trump. Some of its members are pledging to walk out when Trump makes his speech this evening.\\n\\nNPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea is at the AIPAC conference and joins us now. And Don, first, let's look ahead to Trump's speech. What are you going to be listening for?\\n\\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: Well, here's the thing with Donald Trump. We don't know what he'll say - period. And he has made controversy in recent weeks talking about Israel and the Middle East. Just some examples - on the Middle East peace talks, Trump has said he'd be neutral in overseeing negotiations as president. Now, that happens to be stated U.S. policy - to play the neutral third-party. But it is certainly not Republican Party orthodoxy, and he's been criticized for it.\\n\\nHe's also hesitated when asked if the capital of Israel should be moved from Tel Aviv and relocated to Jerusalem. That puts him at odds with this room by not having a firm yes answer. He's soft in both positions there, but he's got a few things to clarify before this audience.\\n\\nAnd then the other thing is this is very different from a Donald Trump rally. It's the kind of place where every word is measured and checked very closely. So the usual off-the-cuff freewheeling speech that we generally get from Donald Trump might not get a great reception here if that's what he chooses to do.\\n\\nCORNISH: Right. As we mentioned earlier, the potential for walkouts - what's the message that those protesters might be trying to send at that AIPAC speech?\\n\\nGONYEA: A lot of it is real concern about how he'd approach the peace process. So there's that. But there are all kinds of things. There are worries about religious intolerance on Trump's part. Prime Minister Netanyahu was among those who condemned Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\\n\\nThen there's - I guess you could just say there's the general tone of the Trump campaign that many people object to. So that too might spark some walkouts, some protests, some no-shows.\\n\\nCORNISH: Let's turn to Hillary Clinton now. As we said, she spoke this morning. Clearly Donald Trump was on her mind as well. What did she have to say?\\n\\nGONYEA: She did not mention Trump by name. But I'm going to play a piece of tape for you here, and it is clear who she was talking about. Give a listen.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON: Yes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows-what on Wednesday because everything's negotiable.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nGONYEA: And big, sustained applause there. It was her biggest applause line. And, you know, she basically said that the kind of campaign that Trump is running - again, not mentioning him by name - is just not what America is.\\n\\nCORNISH: So what did Clinton have to say about relations with Israel?\\n\\nGONYEA: She talked a lot about how critical it is that the U.S. and Israel have a very strong partnership and how other nations should not be allowed to drive a wedge between them and how Israel's security is paramount - so all of the things that you would expect just right down the line there.\\n\\nBut she also addressed an area where she and AIPAC are at odds. She supports the Iran nuclear deal. AIPAC tried to kill it. Today, she defended the deal, but she did say she will be very tough in dealing with Iran. Give a listen.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: It's not good enough to trust and verify. Our approach must be distrust and verify.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: This deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront Iran's aggression across the region.\\n\\nGONYEA: And again, Audie, you can hear just light applause there, not thunderous but no boos there, either.\\n\\nCORNISH: That's NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington. Don, thank you.\\n\\nGONYEA: My pleasure.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Stop The Presses. No More Capital I For The Internet\\n\\nThe Associated Press and others are no longer capitalizing the word Internet. NPR's Scott Simon talks with the AP's Standards Editor Tom Kent about what the change means.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nA small change about the internet this week - a decapitalization. The Associated Press, and with it The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications, declared that as of June 1, they will no longer spell internet with a capital I. Tom Kent is standards editor of the Associated Press and coeditor of the AP Stylebook. He joins us from New York. Tom, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nTOM KENT: How are you, Scott?\\n\\nSIMON: Fine, thanks, but I don't have to answer a lot of these questions from persnickety grammar people. Why was the internet capitalized in the first place?\\n\\nKENT: Well, that's a good question. The internet is wholly generic, like the telephone or electricity. It never was trademarked. It's not based on any proper noun. And I think the best reason for capitalizing in the past may just have been the term was new. I read that at one point people, capitalized phonograph, so maybe it was something like that, but now it's a routine part of daily life.\\n\\nSIMON: Is it in anyway because to a lot of people, the internet is a place?\\n\\nKENT: It is. And when people sometimes say, I bought it on the internet, maybe they're thinking it's like, I bought in France.\\n\\nSIMON: (Laughter).\\n\\nKENT: But it's not a place. It's a network of places. It's here. It's there. It's everywhere.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah. I should explain that NPR apparently has not changed its policy, so you will notice that I am pronouncing internet with a capital I.\\n\\nKENT: It comes right through.\\n\\nSIMON: Thank you. Can I ask you a couple of other AP style questions?\\n\\nKENT: Oh, yeah.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah. So as a Chicagoan, I've always had to refer to the L train as an E-L. You say just the letter L will be OK from now on.\\n\\nKENT: Yeah. We now have L as the shortest entry in the AP Stylebook. What they say is L in news media in Chicago - that's what the Chicago Transit Authority says. So E-L - I think there's probably some sentimental attachment in the sense of elevated, but it really is the L, so we have formalized that now.\\n\\nSIMON: How often do you review and revise?\\n\\nKENT: We review the Stylebook officially once a year, but most people these days access the Stylebook not through the paper book, but through Stylebook Online. And we make updates to that all the time. So it's a fairly frequent thing. A lot of the changes are small, but now and then, we do things that in the world of style are a big deal.\\n\\nA year or so ago, the world was turned upside down - or part of the world was turned upside down - when we decided that it was it OK to say over ten instead of more than ten. And the internet change has brought a lot of reaction, too. Somebody tweeted, after we announced the change, AP has lowercased internet. Somewhere tonight, galaxies are burning.\\n\\nSIMON: (Laughter) And you know what? The AP and NPR will be there to cover them.\\n\\nKENT: Absolutely.\\n\\nSIMON: Tom Kent, standards editor of the Associated Press. Thanks so much.\\n\\nKENT: Pleasure.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

{"original": "Assessing President Trump's Legacy On U.S. Immigration Policy\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump visits South Texas today to highlight a cornerstone of his legacy - immigration and a border wall. From the moment he announced his campaign, he made clear that halting immigration would be part of his political brand. To do that, we're joined by the host of Latino USA, Maria Hinojosa.\\n\\nWelcome back to the program.\\n\\nMARIA HINOJOSA: It's great to be back with you, Audie.\\n\\nCORNISH: And immigration attorney Efren Olivares - he's in McAllen, Texas.\\n\\nWelcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.\\n\\nEFREN OLIVARES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nCORNISH: We're going to get into some of the specific policies, family separation, remain in Mexico and, of course, building of the fence along the border. Efren, I want to talk to you as someone who deals with clients who have been struggling with these policies over the last few years. What's your big takeaway on what this has been like under this particular administration?\\n\\nOLIVARES: If there's anything that the Trump administration has made abundantly clear is that the motivation behind anti-immigrant policies and practices is not really keeping communities safe. It's not really protecting American jobs. It's not about national security or securing the border. What these policies are motivated by, it's an intent to keep this country as white as it was a hundred years ago. It's a white supremacist ideology that is driving the policies of this administration by white nationalist groups. And we saw that violently last week.\\n\\nCORNISH: Maria, I want to come to you as well, because no administration, I think, can get an A on the immigration scorecard, right? It's been a struggle clearly in Congress for decades. But for you, what's your big takeaway from the last four years?\\n\\nHINOJOSA: The last four years really has been a culmination of decades of really inaction by both the Republicans and the Democrats and, frankly, by an increased rhetoric around immigrants and immigration that couldn't be further from the truth. We have this narrative now that we are painted. If immigrants were, for example, invisible to a certain degree, now we are being targeted. Now we are being seen as something that we are not. There is a narrative that this administration, the outgoing Trump administration, has created. And so in many ways, you know, it comes down to communities. Are you talking to the immigrants in your own community and making them understand that you don't see them as a threat, but rather you see them as part and parcel of who we are? So it's been a really challenging, ugly four years, but there is a possibility for people to now take this to heart and make changes.\\n\\nCORNISH: Efren, I want to bring you in here because you actually represented families who were separated at the border. And here's former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly explaining that program to NPR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nJOHN KELLY: The children will be taken care of, they'll put into foster care or whatever, but the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States. And this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.\\n\\nCORNISH: Efren, just to come back to your work for a second, what do some of these families tell you today?\\n\\nOLIVARES: Well, a lot of them are reunited with their children, still going, you know, to counseling and dealing with the long-term effects of the torture and the trauma that they were subjected to by this administration. Some of them have been deported, including some without their children. So those cases continue to be litigated now, more than two years, 2 1/2 years later. And it's going to be a - still a very long battle. And the effects, especially on the children, are going to be long lasting.\\n\\nCORNISH: One of the other contentious policies of this term was ending DACA. That was the Obama-era program that gave a reprieve from deportation to the children of parents who had brought them to the U.S. without documentation. And the Supreme Court struck down Trump's plan to end it altogether, didn't rule out the policy itself. Maria, what do you think is the future of DACA? Is this conversation ongoing or settled?\\n\\nHINOJOSA: No, no, no, no, no. It's ongoing. Here's the thing - for those of us who have been talking about immigration, reporting on it for, OK, several decades now, what people really have been asking for is comprehensive immigration reform. That meant that DACA was created as a slice to respond to a particular moment, and Barack Obama had to be forced to create DACA. So what now - what people want is actually massive, comprehensive across the board, so that young people who were brought here who are no longer young but part of the DACA program are included in this, their parents, their grandparents, their children. It has to be across the board. And enough with the family separation and the notion of, well, there are good immigrants and there are bad immigrants. It needs to stop.\\n\\nCORNISH: We mentioned DACA. We mentioned the rebuilding of the fence along the border. I could probably even throw in the travel ban, for example. Maria, just to start, is there a particular policy that you think will leave a mark?\\n\\nHINOJOSA: I think every single policy that Donald Trump took over the last four years and the rhetoric in the lead up to, so really five years. I don't know how you can kind of say, well, you know, the taking of the uterus is worse than the taking of a child and putting it behind a cage is worse than, you know, losing parents. I mean, we as a country have got to come to terms with the level of dehumanization that we have been experiencing around immigrations for - around immigrants and immigration for decades, but really intensified dramatically so over the last four years.\\n\\nCORNISH: Efren, can I ask you about the news of the day where President Trump is taking a last look at the progress, so to speak, on a border wall? Is that another kind of part of his legacy? And what does that mean?\\n\\nOLIVARES: You know, he is ending his presidency the way he started his bid for president, you know, attacking immigrants and using the border wall as a symbol of his white nationalist agenda. It adds insult to injury to come and do it here in South Texas and to showcase the wasted millions and billions of dollars of this project in the middle of the worst pandemic this country has seen in a century, where hospitals here in the Rio Grande Valley are at capacity. And yet here is a president probably not wearing a mask and bragging about his campaign when of waste - that has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars because, by the way, it's us, the taxpayers that have paid for that, not Mexico.\\n\\nCORNISH: From the Southern Poverty Law Center, immigration attorney Efren Olivares. He's the deputy legal director for immigrant justice there.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOLIVARES: My pleasure. Thank you.\\n\\nCORNISH: Maria Hinojosa is the host of Latino USA and author of a new memoir, Once I Was You: A Memoir Of Love And Hate In A Torn America.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\n\\nHINOJOSA: Thank you, Audie.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "What's Being Done To Address The Country's Backlog Of Untested Rape Kits\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Scuteri/AP Rick Scuteri/AP\\n\\nAcross the country, tens of thousands of rape kits are sitting in police evidence rooms — waiting to be tested.\\n\\nSome have been sitting there for years, but a national push to address the backlog has given the issue a sense of urgency. Several states have taken up the cause. Last week, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced he is forming a task force to find and test old kits and Kentucky is pushing a bill that requires rape kits to be tested within 30 days of collection.\\n\\nTo learn more about what kind of progress has been made, NPR's Rachel Martin spoke with Becca O'Connor, vice president for public policy at the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), one of the groups spearheading the effort.\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nOn when it became clear that cities had backlogs from not testing these kits\\n\\nIt started really in the late 90s and early 2000s as we saw advancements in the science itself around DNA technology and as people started to literally open up the evidence rooms and warehouses across the country and discover these troves of kits in different jurisdictions.\\n\\nOn the backlog numbers at its worst\\n\\nUnfortunately, we don't have an overarching number so that's why we still talk in estimates and that maintains the problem. But if you look at states like Texas, where they were one of the pioneers in auditing and inventory in their kits, they had 20,000 kits. We had thousands in cities alone and the numbers were to say the least disturbing. In Illinois, 4,000 kits. Michigan, 11,000 in Detroit alone. In Ohio, 4,000 kits found in Cleveland and then 10,000 kits across the state.\\n\\nOn why these kits were not being tested for so many years\\n\\nIt's a number of factors: The issue may have been that they couldn't have tested the evidence in the same way that they can now under existing technology. Ten or 15 years ago the DNA technology wasn't in the same place it is today ... We now are able to pull much more out of a rape kit through DNA testing than we have been able to in the past.\\n\\nAnd beyond that, there was also a different mentality around these crimes. For many people the belief was stranger-perpetrated crimes where you have someone leap out of the bushes, and we know better now. We have more of a push and an inclination to test even in acquaintance cases because we know that these are serial offenders and are likely to strike again. ...\\n\\nOver time, the other thing that's evolved of course is the CODIS, the national database run by the FBI, which holds offender samples and that's grown, we have more basically things to check against so it's increased our likelihood of finding people who have been serial criminals or struck again across state lines or in their own neighborhoods\\n\\nOn why it remains a problem, given federal legislation to address the backlog — as far back as 2000\\n\\nWe talk about this backlog in generic terminology, but it's important to point out that to the Department of Justice and others that there's a kit sitting at a crime lab and waiting to be tested. And as we've been talking about, we know that many of these kits never make it to that stage, they sit in evidence rooms. So there's this education that needs to happen so that when someone, say a lawmaker is looking into the problem within their own state, want to know if they have an issue with a backlog, they can pick up the phone and call people and have them understand exactly what it is they're asking, we're not just asking, do you have kits that haven't been tested yet, do you have kits that have never made it to that page.\\n\\nThat said, there's also the problem of educating everyone from law enforcement, prosecutors, about the value of this evidence. And going back even further a step, we do have this challenge of creating a system where victims feel comfortable coming forward and submitting themselves to these exams in the wake of what's likely the worst trauma of their lives. If I'm a survivor and I'm seeing headlines that say that my kit is going to sit and collect dust somewhere, where's my incentive to come forward? I think that's one of the things that we're seeing shift as more and more states step up to the plate and do what needs to be done to clear their backlogs.\\n\\nOn feeling some encouragement from recent movement on the issue\\n\\nRAINN is part of an initiative called the Rape Kit Action Project where we're working with state lawmakers that are working on these issues to help inform it, as well as we're part of a team of national experts advising recently-granted Bureau of Justice Assistance jurisdictions that receive funding through them to address their backlogs because we know that there's no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem. So in every jurisdiction, they're going to have their own resource constraints, their own policies, their own laws even about what's required, the timeline their testing, what are we going in order to notify victims down the path if a hit occurs when they run a sample in CODIS.\\n\\nAnd what's really, really encouraging as I talk to lawmakers across the country and in the federal government, is that people are starting to have these 'a-ha!' moments and realizing that first of all, it's OK to raise your hand and say we may have a problem here and we want to get to the bottom of it. You know, there's no finger-pointing at this point in terms of calling people out for it. Obviously it's not an ideal situation but what's really been amazing even in just the three years that I've been working on this issue here at RAINN is the shift and the desire to be proactive rather than just reactive to the issue.\\n\\nOn the cost to test each rape kit\\n\\nThe average is between $400 and $1,200. ...\\n\\nIt can be [a big hit to states that have a big backlog] but it depends on exactly what they're planning to test out of that kit. You know, sometimes they have to run certain tests that that'll limit the cost to the jurisdiction. You know costs outweigh by the benefit we believe."}
{"original": "Colin Kaepernick Is Chosen For Nike's Anniversary 'Just Do It' Campaign\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 3:55 p.m. ET\\n\\nWith his decision two summers ago to not stand for the national anthem, Colin Kaepernick became the face of a protest movement in the NFL against racial injustice and police brutality. Now, the former quarterback has become a face of one of the most iconic advertising campaigns in the history of sports: Nike's Just Do It campaign.\\n\\nAn early image from the campaign made its debut on Monday with a tweet from Kaepernick. The advertisement shows a black-and-white image of the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback. The text on top of the image reads: Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\\n\\nAs part of the campaign commemorating the 30th anniversary of Just Do It, Nike will produce new Kaepernick apparel, including a shoe and a T-shirt, according to The New York Times. Nike, which supplies game-day uniforms and sideline apparel for the league's 32 teams, will also donate to Kaepernick's Know Your Rights campaign, according to the Times.\\n\\nNews of Kaepernick's role in the campaign comes at a delicate moment for the NFL. With the 2018 regular season set to begin on Thursday, the league and its players union remain locked in a stalemate over a controversial national anthem policy ratified by team owners in May. The policy gave players the option to stay in the locker room during the anthem, but required them to stand if on the field or face possible discipline by their teams.\\n\\nThe policy was put on hold in July, leaving the NFL without a resolution to what's become one of the most polarizing issues in sports. The player protests have drawn frequent criticism from President Trump, who in a speech last September said, Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now?' \\n\\nJustin Tinsley, a journalist for ESPN's The Undefeated, told NPR's Morning Edition that some NFL fans may object to Nike's seeming endorsement of Kaepernick and his message, but it will likely have a minimal financial impact on the company, which has a global appeal far beyond American football.\\n\\nYou might see people burning their [Nike] shoes on social media but it's nothing that [they] need to be concerned about from a widespread angle, Tinsley said.\\n\\nHe added that in appearing to support Kaepernick's fight — whether motivated by financial self-interest or genuine altruism — it helps build trust between Nike and the communities that buy their product.\\n\\nIn an interview shortly after his protest began, Kaepernick told NFL media, To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since parting ways with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season. He alleges that the NFL colluded to deny him a contract as punishment for his role in the player protests. Last week, an arbitrator ruled that his grievance against the league merits a formal hearing.\\n\\nThe NFL has yet to issue a response to the ad campaign, but some in the league have said they believe the protests have damaged the popularity of professional football. Nike, for its part, has previously said that it supports athletes and their right to freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society.\\n\\nThat is a strategy that Tinsley said has paid off well for the company in this current era of sports activism. He noted, in addition to Kaepernick, who first inked a deal with Nike in 2011, it also has launched hugely successful lines with Serena Williams and LeBron James, who are both vocal advocates of social justice causes.\\n\\nThat goes a long way with the legacy of a company, Tinsley said."}
{"original": "NASCAR Driver Tony Stewart Revved Up To Treat Fans To His Final Drive\\n\\nThe man some NASCAR racing fans call the last of the 'old school' drivers is retiring soon. Tony Stewart is known for his aggressive and controversial style.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nTo NASCAR now and a controversial driver who will hit the gas just a few more times before retiring. Tony Stewart has won three championships, become co-owner of a race team and paid numerous fines over his 18 seasons. His style has created enemies, but it's also why his fans love him and other drivers respect him. From member station WFAE, Michael Tomsic reports.\\n\\nMICHAEL TOMSIC, BYLINE: Tony Stewart has a temper. That's been clear since 1999, his rookie season in NASCAR's top circuit.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And as you can see, Tony Stewart here was out of his car, throwing his gloves at Kenny Irwin.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Stewart reached into Irwin's moving car and had to let go as Irwin sped off. That was after the two drivers kept bumping each other in a race. NASCAR fined Stewart $5,000. In the years since he's crashed cars, shoved drivers, punched a photographer, kicked a tape recorder and stomped back onto the track to throw something.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Tony's not very happy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Whoa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Gosh, looks familiar.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Two things stand out from this instant in 2012 - how the crowd roared as Stewart nailed Matt Kenseth's windshield with his helmet and how nonchalant the announcers were.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: That's a perfect strike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: That's a nice throw.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Just Stewart being Stewart. Matt Kenseth laughs about it now.\\n\\nMATT KENSETH: Nobody likes being involved in that stuff, but whether they tell you they like to or not, everybody loves to watch it, right? So...\\n\\nTOMSIC: He says it's certainly a draw for fans. And he says the fire Stewart races with is part of what makes him great.\\n\\nKENSETH: Man, I've never seen anybody more talented behind the wheel than Tony. Whether it's in a dirt car or a stock car, there's nobody better.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Stewart was a dirt track champion and Indy car champion before transitioning to NASCAR's top circuit. He then won NASCAR's Sprint Cup championship in 2002, 2005 and 2011. He kept racing on dirt tracks, too. And in 2014, that led to what he calls a tragic accident. On a dirt track in New York, Stewart knocked Kevin Ward, Jr.'s car into a wall. Ward then walked into the middle of the race to confront Stewart's car.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Oh, he hit him.\\n\\nTOMSIC: In a spectator's YouTube video, you see Stewart's car fishtail and Ward go under one of the tires, killing him. Stewart says it was an accident, and a grand jury decided not to press charges. After that decision, Stewart said he thinks about what happened every day.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nTONY STEWART: It's going to be a part of my life. It's going to be a part of Kevin's family's life. It's never going to go away for any of us. But hopefully, it'll get easier for all of us.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Ward's family sued Stewart and that lawsuit is now in federal court. Stewart has continued to drive aggressively and speak his mind. This season, NASCAR fined him $35,000 after he blasted the association for a lug nut policy that he said put drivers at risk with loose wheels.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSTEWART: I don't know if it was the delivery that got NASCAR upset or what, but the message was right. I think you guys know after 17 full years of this if I strongly believe in something, I'm going to speak up for it.\\n\\nTOMSIC: A group of NASCAR drivers paid the fine for Stewart and NASCAR later changed the policy. In the campground at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Jerry Goodin says Stewart reminds him of iconic drivers from earlier generations like Richard Petty.\\n\\nJERRY GOODIN: He's going to do what it takes to win. He's very aggressive. He doesn't hold back, says he wants to say.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Goodin says Stewart is the last of the old-school drivers.\\n\\nJUDY WILEY: And I'm old-school, too, so I guess that's why I kind of like him (laughter).\\n\\nTOMSIC: This is another fan, Judy Wiley.\\n\\nWILEY: That's the greatest thing you can say about him. He's old-school. But he's a genuine good person.\\n\\nTOMSIC: She points to the foundation he's had for many years that helps critically ill children. Some drivers say it's part of the generous off-the-track version of Stewart many people don't see. Defending champion Kyle Busch says when he first started...\\n\\nKYLE BUSCH: He put his arm around me and definitely helped me and gave me some insight on how the sport is.\\n\\nTOMSIC: With a handful of races left, Stewart is out of the running for this year's championship. When he announced his plan to retire, he made clear he's not going away.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSTEWART: NASCAR's probably going to be the most disappointed of everybody today because they aren't getting rid of me. So they have to deal with me as an owner. So there's still the opportunity to get fined and there's still opportunity to be put on probation, just like always.\\n\\nTOMSIC: Stewart will remain co-owner of the Stewart-Haas racing team. He jokes that next season, you'll probably see him enjoying a race from the top of some fan's motor home.

{"original": "Trump Sees Border Wall As Another Boost For U.S. Steel Industry\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAs President Trump describes it, a steel wall along the Mexican border isn't just about protecting the country from terrorists and drug dealers. It would also be a boon for big steel, an industry he says is essential for American identity.\\n\\nI'll have it done by the United States Steel Corp., by companies in our country that are now powerful, great companies again, he said Friday at the White House. And they've become powerful over the last two years because of me and because of our trade policies.\\n\\nTrump has made clear how he reveres the beleaguered steel industry, once saying that without one, You almost don't have much of a country.\\n\\nSince taking office, Trump has filled his administration with former steel industry executives and attorneys, such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They have made reviving the industry a major priority, by protecting it from what they say are unfair foreign trade practices.\\n\\nLast year, the administration slapped tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum.\\n\\nThe tariffs have been highly controversial, especially because they were justified on national security grounds. But the biggest source of U.S. steel imports is Canada, a strong American ally.\\n\\nDespite that, the tariffs have benefited big steel, by raising the price of imports and easing the pressure on domestic companies to keep their prices low.\\n\\nOur steel industry is now thriving and getting better every single day and it's jobs, and it's that money pouring into our coffers. It's beautiful, Trump said at a Missouri campaign rally in November 2018.\\n\\nTrump has claimed — falsely — that seven steel plants are being built as a result of the boon touched off by his trade agenda. But at least one new plant is being built and some others are being upgraded. And profits are up for big companies such as Nucor and U.S. Steel.\\n\\nOrders are up. Shipments are up. Hiring is up. Wages are up, says Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. No matter which metric you look at, the steel industry is unquestioningly doing better than it has been for the past couple of years.\\n\\nBut numerous manufacturers have also complained that they're being hurt by higher prices for imported steel and aluminum. That includes companies in key industries such as housing and autos.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that as you lend a hand to particular producers — producers of upstream products like steel — you raise the cost of production for steel-consuming industries and steel-consuming firms, says Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies.\\n\\nIn fact, the number of companies that use steel is much greater than the number of steel-producing firms, he notes.\\n\\nIf you do the math, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to go to bat for the steel industry in the first place, because you're really hurting a more significant portion of the economy, Ikenson says.\\n\\nManufacturers that are unable to acquire the steel they need from domestic suppliers can ask the Commerce Department for an exemption from the tariffs. But the government has been slow to process the exemptions, and many companies are still waiting to hear about their requests.\\n\\nIkenson is also less than impressed with the industry's alleged boom, saying it has a lot to do with broader economic forces.\\n\\nThe steel industry is a cyclical industry. It ebbs and flows with the economy, and right now the economy is sort of peaked out and perhaps beginning to slow down a little bit. If you look at steel stock indexes, they're about where they were a year ago, he says."}
{"original": "Is The Pandemic Causing A Surge In Female Genital Mutilation?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Siegfried Modola/Reuters Siegfried Modola/Reuters\\n\\nIn early December, Christine Ghati Alfons taught a menstrual hygiene class to a group of girls, 10 to 15 years old, in the ethnic Kuria community in Migori County, an impoverished, rural area in southwest Kenya. Normally, she says, the class has 25 students. On this day, only 17 girls showed up.\\n\\nWe lost some of these girls, says Ghati Alfons, founder of the Safe Engage Foundation, a community-based group that works to end female genital mutilation (FGM).\\n\\nAccording to Ghati Alfons, the eight missing girls had all undergone the cut, as FGM is often called; two of them had then been married off, the other six were home recovering. Nine other girls who attended the class had also been subjected to genital cutting in recent months, she says.\\n\\nGhati Alfons' missing students are part of a massive wave of girls believed to have been subjected to FGM, and in many cases, subsequently married off, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. It's happening not just in Kenya but across East and West Africa, according to a September report from the Orchid Project, a London-based nonprofit that works with global partners to end FGM. The practice occurs in many parts of the world, though the Orchid Project's report highlighted the pandemic-era surge in Africa. It also attempted to gather information about parts of Asia where FGM is prevalent but was unable to draw conclusions because of a lack of systemic reporting.\\n\\nAnti-FGM activists say lockdowns and school closures during the pandemic left many girls at home, vulnerable to genital cutting in communities that see the practice as a prerequisite for marriage and, in some places, as a rite of passage. Girls who have not been cut might be shunned by the community or considered not fit for marriage.\\n\\nThe girls are normally protected and shielded by the fact of being in school, which is an alternative to marriage, says Domtila Chesang, founder of I-Rep Foundation, a community-based group aimed at eradicating FGM in West Pokot County in Western Kenya.\\n\\nEconomic pressures heightened by the pandemic have led many struggling parents to seek bride prices — the payment of goods such as cattle to a family for a bride.\\n\\nThese girls are not just being cut. They are also being forcibly married off. And a girl that has had FGM is worth more. It's seen as an investment into the girl and her ability to be married off, says Nimco Ali, an activist who was born in Somaliland and subjected to FGM. She now lives in London, where she leads The Five Foundation, a global partnership to end FGM.\\n\\nFGM can have long-lasting impacts on health, including scarring, urinary incontinence, painful sexual intercourse and complications during childbirth, as well as psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression.\\n\\nIn parts of West Africa, some former cutters who had abandoned FGM have returned to the practice because it was a way that they saw that they could obtain income at this difficult time, says Ebony Riddell Bamber, head of policy and advocacy at the Orchid Project. But the increase in FGM is particularly startling in Kenya, because the country, which outlawed the practice in 2011, was widely seen as making real strides toward eradicating it. Last year, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta made an ambitious pledge to stamp out FGM by 2022. Then came the pandemic, which redirected policing and other resources elsewhere, allowing local traditional leaders to flout the law.\\n\\nAround 21% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM. But the prevalence varies dramatically. It's nearly universal among some ethnic groups and practically nonexistent among others, according to UNICEF.\\n\\nGhati Alfons says FGM remains widespread among Kenya's Kuria community, many of whom live in abject poverty. She explains: They don't even have something to eat, but here comes someone who is offering them some money in exchange for [marrying] their daughters.\\n\\nGhati Alfons says that traditionally among the Kuria people, cuttings took place beginning in November, at the end of the Kenyan school year. But this year, school closures that began in March left girls exposed at home, and the cuttings began much earlier. As many as 2,800 girls — some as young as 7 or 8 years old — in Kuria are believed to have been cut between September and mid-October, when Kenyan schools partially reopened, according to estimates from the Five Foundation based on reports from activists on the ground.\\n\\nNormally they cut for two weeks, but this time they went for more than four weeks, Ghati Alfons says. So that means more girls were cut and many girls are now not even back to school. She says many of the girls subjected to FGM have been married off, and many others did not return to school because they needed time to heal.\\n\\nAfter being cut, Kuria girls are publicly showered with shoes, clothes and other gifts, which can serve as an enticement to other girls to undergo the procedure, Ghati Alfons says. I grew up longing for the cuts because of the gifts, she says. She says she changed her mind after her mother told her that her late father had been adamantly opposed to FGM.\\n\\nSamburu County, a rural, pastoralist region of northern Kenya, also saw a sharp increase in girls being subjected to genital mutilation during the pandemic, says Josephine Kulea, founder and executive director of the Samburu Girls Foundation, which works to prevent FGM on girls as young as 7 by convincing their families to enroll them in school and supporting them through university.\\n\\nKulea says Samburu County has high rates of illiteracy, and the girls who do get educated attend boarding schools. But when schools closed in March, girls returned to their villages at a time when they were hosting mass circumcisions of boys. So when the girls went back to the villages, it was an opportunity to cut them too, she says.\\n\\nKulea says her group alone reported more than 500 cases of female genital mutilation and child marriages to the authorities from just three Samburu villages between March and July, but she estimates the number of Samburu girls affected may have been twice that amount. You can tell who has been cut by how the girls are walking, she says.\\n\\nI'm sure in January when schools reopen there will be very few girls back in school, because most of them got married, she says.\\n\\nChesang says in Kenya's West Pokot County, over 1,000 girls fell victim to mass cuttings earlier this year, though she says the government disputes that number. Her group is currently sheltering about 25 girls they rescued from FGM. There are also some girls who have been forced into marriage that I tried to save but failed, Chesang says. She, too, worries that many girls who were cut in her area will never return to school, because they've been married off or have become pregnant.\\n\\nChesang, Kulea and Ghati Alfons all say the cuttings in their respective regions have slowed down. In part, that's because so many girls have already been subjected to FGM. But they all agree that the Kenyan government has stepped up its efforts to enforce anti-FGM laws and punish perpetrators in the wake of Kenyan media coverage of the spike in cuttings and the ensuing public outcry.\\n\\nSome of that media coverage came in October, after Ghati Alfons and other anti-FGM activists shared videos on social media showing hundreds of Kuria girls being paraded and celebrated in the streets after being subjected to FGM.\\n\\nIn Kenya, hundreds of Kuria girls are paraded and celebrated in the streets after being subjected to FGM.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe airing of the issues on national television really worked, Ghati Alfons says. And that is one thing that I feel so proud of and so happy about this year.\\n\\nIt's one thing to have laws against FGM, Ali says, but you also need activists on the ground to hold local leaders accountable for enforcing them.\\n\\nUnless you're within communities doing the work day in, day out, so when times like the pandemic occur, you can be there to actively prevent and protect girls, we will keep on seeing these peaks in FGM, Riddell Bamber says.\\n\\nAnd Ali wants to hold Kenya's president to his promise to end the practice by 2022. That goal is beyond ambitious, she says. Now, he has to step up to the plate to actually start to protect the girls in the rural communities."}

{"original": "The Latest Clinton Converts? White, College-Educated Voters\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\n\\nHillary Clinton's recent surge in the polls is being fueled in part by a demographic that President Obama lost handily four years ago — white, college-educated voters.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn over a half-century, no Democratic presidential candidate has carried white voters with a college degree, said Michelle Diggles, a senior political analyst with the center-left think tank Third Way, who described the split between the white working class and whites with a college degree as the most underreported story of this year.\\n\\nGOP nominee Donald Trump is hoping that white working-class voters can fuel his own victory. But his climb becomes doubly harder as he is far behind Clinton in the demographic bloc that is usually reliably Republican.\\n\\nIn the last presidential election, Barack Obama lost the college-educated white voters by 14 points. But now Clinton is winning this same group by about 8.7 points, according to an average of the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal, CNN/ORC and ABC/Washington Post polls.\\n\\nIn the past, many college graduates, white people that were business managers or had various kinds of middle-class jobs, would vote Republican — and that group may be taking a second look at the Democratic Party, said Bill Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nNPR only had access to exit polls dating to 1988, but with the help of the Pew Research Center, we were able to identify the education/class divide and explore the Republican dominance over time.\\n\\nWhy are we seeing a shift now?\\n\\nIt seems that Donald Trump is a uniquely polarizing figure amongst white voters, Diggles observed. There are a lot of voters who are concerned that Donald Trump is ... just so outside of the mainstream and so outside the American political culture that they can't fathom it.\\n\\nShe pointed to Trump's close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his anti-democratic rhetoric, and his threats to the freedom of the press.\\n\\nThe outspoken billionaire's immigration policy — which includes mass deportations and plans to build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. border — also does not seem to resonate well with some well-educated voters.\\n\\nTrump's tone and antics, particularly in the week following the Democratic National Convention — which included a fight with a Muslim American military family, a reluctant endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan and a strange response to sexual harassment — did not help his case either.\\n\\nGOP strategist Lisa Camooso Miller said she is not surprised college-educated voters seem to be tilting toward Clinton, given the tone of the two conventions — the DNC as one of hope but the Republican National Convention as one of fear.\\n\\nI think people that are college educated have a general understanding that America is the melting pot ... and that's what makes this country great, she said. I think that the more [Trump] identifies and specifically singles out various segments of the population, I think that turns people off.\\n\\nCamooso Miller also observed that college-educated voters probably prefer Clinton's stability and predictability, regardless of whether they agree with her specific policy proposals.\\n\\nFrey agreed, arguing that the overall message of the GOP convention depicted an impending era of doom and gloom, targeting Americans who are suffering in the current economy; but he said college-educated voters are more likely to see their jobs as part of a global economy.\\n\\nFrey also believes that for some college-educated voters (who might traditionally vote Republican for economic reasons), the overall vision and identity of the country has become more pivotal to their vote than the economy.\\n\\n[Trump's candidacy] has become not so much an intraparty battle as it has become a battle about what is America, said Diggles, explaining why we have seen a spate of recent defections of high-profile, highly educated Republicans.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for November?\\n\\nIf the polls are accurate, having a college education seems to be a key indicator of how white voters will cast their ballot on Election Day.\\n\\nUsing census data, NPR ranked all 50 states according to the share of the white (non-Hispanic) population, age 25+, with a bachelor's degree or higher.\\n\\nThis helps understand which states may be at play this November and why.\\n\\nFor example, there are a few states on polar opposite ends of the education spectrum:\\n\\nColorado has the highest percentage of white, college-educated voters in the country (43.42). And it is increasingly looking light blue, instead of purple. Recently the Clinton campaign pulled its ads off the airwaves — a sign of growing confidence in the state. There's a similar trend happening in Virginia, too.\\n\\nBut in Ohio, the white population is about as well-educated as Alabama (26.46 percent). Those college education levels help explain why a state like Ohio is likely to be one of the most competitive states in the country for Clinton. The white working class is a powerful force in Ohio. And even though Clinton may be edging out Trump among educated white voters, he is clobbering her among working-class whites.\\n\\nIn recent election cycles, blue-collar white voters have voted consistently Republican; Trump is hoping to do better than Mitt Romney or John McCain did with this group in 2012 and 2008, respectively. And in the Buckeye State, it's a gamble that might pay off.\\n\\nI certainly think Ohio is a state where there's a good possibility that the noncollege whites could bring a victory to Donald Trump ... if they up their turnout, said Frey. He pointed out that many working-class voters feel like they've been left behind in a modern economy, and so they're buying any message Trump sells them.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, another critical battleground state, the white demographics aren't much better for Clinton (29.41 percent), but there's a larger African-American and Latino population to offset the white population.\\n\\nAn era of Clinton Republicans?\\n\\nIt's hard to say whether this realignment of college-educated white voters is a short-term Trump side effect or the beginning of a new political label — so-called Clinton Republicans.\\n\\nTrump is certainly a change candidate, as evidenced by the coalition he built during the GOP primary.\\n\\nBut that change hasn't necessarily appealed to highly educated voters. Last week, the oldest college Republican group in the country, the Harvard Republican Club, said it was ashamed of Trump. It announced it will not be endorsing the GOP presidential nominee — a first in the group's 128-year history.\\n\\nBut Frey questions whether that shift away from Trump will last long-term.\\n\\nI think this time, whoever votes against Donald Trump is not someone who's necessarily gonna stay with the Democratic Party for year after year after year in the future, said Frey. It's probably more a vote against the brand of candidate that Donald Trump represents than maybe a vote against the Republican Party.\\n\\nFor reasons like that, Camooso Miller remains optimistic about her party's future.\\n\\nI think that 2016 is an example year, and is not necessarily the norm, she said. I do not think this is a trend that will grow.\\n\\nThe GOP strategist pointed to other Republican leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who who could help re-energize and re-engage this college-educated white voting demographic in the future.\\n\\nDemocrats' millennial advantage\\n\\nStill, the very people who make up the college-educated white demographic are not necessarily the same people who voted eight years ago. The composition has fundamentally changed.\\n\\nMillennials, the youngest generation of voters, have grown up and now rival baby boomers as a political force — with an estimated 69.2 million eligible voters, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Millennials lean left and are the most educated demographic to date, and they are an increasingly large share of the overall white college-educated bloc.\\n\\nPlus, Diggles insisted that in all of the focus groups she has conducted, she consistently sees a difference between older and younger white men, regardless of their level of education.\\n\\nPolling shows that white millennials are skeptical of a Trump presidency. So as those voters get older, unless they change their political attitudes drastically, the Democratic Party may have an inherent advantage in future elections.\\n\\nThe education/race cleavages explain why the Trump campaign is spending so much time and effort in Ohio and Pennsylvania — Rust Belt states where the white population is less educated than the country as a whole. Because while Clinton may have a single-digit edge with educated voters, Trump has a double-digit advantage with white working-class voters. And in these states, the GOP nominee has more room to grow because there's a larger pool of voters he can potentially energize.\\n\\nAs NPR has reported previously, noncollege white voters, especially men, are one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs — so-called Reagan Democrats.\\n\\nThey think that Donald Trump isn't afraid to speak his mind, and he speaks in a language that represents them and their anger, said Diggles, who points out that in focus groups she often hears from white men nostalgic about the past and frustrated that their economic fortunes aren't as good as their fathers' or grandfathers'.\\n\\nObama lost white blue-collar voters by 25 points, according to 2012 exit polls. But that still wasn't enough to derail his re-election.\\n\\nTo win this year, Trump will need to win white working-class voters by even bigger margins. Polling shows he is currently doing about as well as Romney did, but the hiccup for him is that white working-class voters are a shrinking share of the electorate."}

While the video drew millions of views, it also drew fervent rebukes from people on social media who said it made light of a tragic issue.\\n\\nPaul removed the video a week later and apologized, but YouTube decided to scale back its relationship with the vlogger anyway.

And it shelved plans for a follow-up to his 2017 feature-length film for YouTube, called The Thinning: New World Order.\\n\\nPaul's initial comeback video was an effort by the 22-year-old entrepreneur to wipe the slate clean.

YouTube instructs its creators to use your common sense, don't abuse the site, and be respectful of others.\\n\\nYouTube says Paul violated those guidelines when he posted a video — viewed more than 8 million times — of himself shooting two dead rats with a taser and then laughing gleefully.\\n\\nAccording to YouTube's rules, Paul could have potentially avoided this latest controversy by simply turning off the ads on the video."}
{"original": "States Ban Non-Essential Travel To Mississippi Over 'Religious Freedom' Law\\n\\nThe governors of New York, Washington, Vermont and Minnesota have banned state officials from making non-essential trips to Mississippi in response to the state's new religious freedom law. Critics of the policy say it allows groups to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nMississippi is facing a growing backlash following the passage of its controversial religious freedom law. The law allows businesses and religious groups to deny services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people if they think doing so violates their religious beliefs. It takes affect this summer, but already a growing numbers of states and cities are banning official travel to Mississippi. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports.\\n\\nHANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Mississippi may be known as the hospitality state, but it's becoming a no-go zone for employees of multiple estates and cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Santa Fe. They're protesting a law that Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant told WLBT is designed to prevent government from interfering with people's lives.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPHIL BRYANT: There's no one on the part of the Mississippi legislature or the governor's office that wants to discriminate or harm anyone. If they are worried about protecting people's rights, also understand that people of faith have rights.\\n\\nWANG: But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo doesn't see it that way.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nANDREW CUOMO: Any state that is discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, our message is loud and clear. We think it's wrong. We want to have no part of it.\\n\\nWANG: And neither does Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin who's also imposed a travel ban.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPETER SHUMLIN: If we don't stand up to bigotry if we don't stand up to hatred, it will just continue.\\n\\nWANG: Their offices could not provide the exact number of state employees who have traveled to Mississippi in the past year before broadcast, but Shumlin says any upcoming taxpayer-funded trips would be re-evaluated.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSHUMLIN: If there's an absolute necessity, you can get permission to go, but we're really trying to put as much pressure as we can on governors in states who are promoting hatred at the expense of people's civil rights.\\n\\nWANG: Travel bans have been the go-to response for states and cities taking a stand against religious freedom laws. That was a case with North Carolina last month and with Indiana last year. This latest ban against Mississippi is forcing many local businesses to think about their bottom line.\\n\\nAccording to Sungsoo Kim, a professor at the University of Southern Mississippi's business school. He says his state already has a hard time attracting visitors.\\n\\nSUNGSOO KIM: There's no major - no tourist attraction that can attract outside visitors. We don't want to lose any possibility to bring people into the Mississippi state.\\n\\nWANG: The Mississippi Economic Council, the state's chamber of commerce, says the law goes against its nondiscrimination policy. And in a statement released before the bill was signed, the Mississippi Manufacturers Association said it fears the future of economic development opportunities will be jeopardized.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nMITCHELL MOORE: Mississippi is an amazing place, and it's filled with amazing people. But if you don't know that, you're going to choose to not come here because of bills like this.\\n\\nWANG: Mitchell Moore owns a bakery in Jackson, Miss. He told NPR's MORNING EDITION that he considers himself a deeply Christian man, and he plans to continue selling wedding cakes to clients regardless of their sexual orientation. Still, he says, he is worried about unintended consequences of Mississippi's law.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nMOORE: If it is my sincerely held religious belief that I shouldn't serve them, then I can do that, and I can hide behind that language. But that language is so vague. It opens up Pandora's box, and you can't shut it again.\\n\\nWANG: In the meantime, Mississippi will be shut off from official visits by New York, Washington and other states unless the law is changed or overturned by a court.

The commission opted against stricter prohibitions, arguing that its power to adopt a full ban appears sketchy and that it has no budget to take actions such as installing metal detectors at public entrances.\\n\\nWe have no authority to implement the infrastructure to go beyond that at this point, said Commissioner William Kandler. We have no budget. We're not experts in security.\\n\\nThe decision was widely panned and faintly praised.\\n\\nOn a normal day, hundreds of people walk through the Capitol, including groups of fourth graders, teachers and parents on school field trips to learn about state government. That's why we must take action to ban all weapons at the Capitol to keep Michiganders safe, said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a statement released by her office. I am hopeful that the Capitol Commission will recognize the need for further action, and I stand ready to assist in implementing this policy to keep Michiganders safe.\\n\\nWhitmer was the target of an alleged plot to kidnap and execute her over COVID-19 restrictions. According to investigators, some of those indicted in that alleged plot had met at the April protest in Lansing.\\n\\nArmed protesters used our state Capitol for a spring dress rehearsal for what went on in Washington, D.C. last week, said state Rep. Brenda Carter, a Democrat. The ban on open carry firearms is long overdue and it is my hope we see further action.\\n\\nIncoming Republican House Speaker Jason Wentworth said he thinks the commission exceeded its authority. In a statement released by his office, he said:\\n\\nThe Speaker is grateful for the work of the Capitol Commission, but it does not have the authority to set policy in the Capitol. The Speaker will be looking at options for handling that moving forward. In the meantime, the Michigan State Police will be enforcing the new ruling. In order to ensure there is no confusion at the Capitol, Speaker Wentworth asks everyone to respect the Michigan State Police and the rules they enforce.\\n\\nWentworth's spokesman said the GOP leader is considering next steps, such as introducing a bill to outline the rules (which would be subject to a veto by the governor) or filing a lawsuit to challenge the commission's authority.\\n\\nBut Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, says the commission has the authority and should go further than the rule adopted Monday.\\n\\nFirearms — whether explicitly visible or concealed by clothing — possess the same capability to inflict injury and harm on others and only banning open carry does little to meaningfully improve the safety and security of our Capitol, she said. I urge the commission or our Legislature to take the proper action and pass the necessary reforms that truly take into account the safety of those visiting and working in our Capitol."}

{"original": "On Broadway, 'Network' Goes From Satire To Tragedy\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bruce Glikas/WireImage Bruce Glikas/WireImage\\n\\nOne of the hottest tickets on Broadway this season is Network, the stage adaptation of the 1976 movie about a news anchor who cracks up on the air and the executives who exploit his ravings for ratings.\\n\\n\\n\\nIvo Van Hove is directing the stage show. He says he first saw Network in a Belgian movie theater when he was a young man. My memory of it is that it felt like science fiction, he says. Something which was impossible, which could never ever happen. When I read the script, now a few years ago, I thought well, this is the world that we live in today. So this was also the challenge, of course, how to make this work that was a little bit of a parody in its time — how to turn it into a tragedy.\\n\\nHoward Beale's original rant YouTube\\n\\nIn Network's climax, anchor Howard Beale hears a voice ordering him to go on the air and tell his audience the truth. In his pajamas, he rushes into the newsroom and on to the set to share his epiphany, and in the film, actor Peter Finch starts right in with his revelations: I don't have to tell you things are bad, he yells. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work. Or scared of losing their job ...\\n\\nBut here, the play differs from the film. Actor Bryan Cranston — as Beale — rushes into the TV studio, then spends seemingly endless silent minutes grasping for words. Cranston says it's like the experience of waking up from a vivid dream, and we think 'oh, this is indelible!' And you start to try to recall it, and it dissipates, like fog. And so he collapses from that. And out of that despair and public humiliation comes the speech. Cranston actually wells up with tears when he finally speaks.\\n\\nIn both the screen and stage versions, Beale's rants touch a nerve with his television audience and his ratings spike. The network executives seize the opportunity to build an entertainment program around his newscast: The anchor becomes a celebrity, and infotainment is born. Keep in mind, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky predicted this more than 40 years ago, and it won him an Oscar.\\n\\nIn his dressing room before a recent matinee, Cranston said Chayefsky's prescience was frightening. One of the speeches, if you recall, was 'Only three percent of you people read books. Only 15 percent read newspapers. The numbers were likely never that bad — but according to the most recent study, roughly half of all Americans still prefer to watch the news on TV, with the Internet not far behind. Remember Howard Beale also says, 'Don't look to us for the truth, because we just tell you what you want to hear,' Cranston says.\\n\\nDirector Van Hove says that in the stage adaptation of Network, the medium has become the message. As the action cuts between characters, the dialogue is recorded by actors with cameras, and broadcast live across huge screens that wrap around the set. One scene is even shot outside the theater, and follows a conversation between two actors on 44th Street as they walk into the building and onto the stage.\\n\\nVan Hove says he wanted to make the audience feel the intensity of being in the middle of a live TV show. If you have been in a live TV show, it's always a pressure cooker, he says. There's a countdown, and it's 7 o'clock, it has to start. You cannot wait. You cannot say 'Stop, I'm not ready. Let's do it again.' No, there's no doing it again. You do it once and it's over. And that thrill I wanted to give. And at the same time, another thing became for me important, that there would be cameras everywhere. It's as if the world became a television studio.\\n\\nThe play began at London's National Theater in 2017. Cranston says its message resonates on both sides of the Atlantic. The idea of anger driving policy. Of fear and demagoguery as a real motivation for change, whether you view it as good or bad, i.e. Brexit, or Donald Trump becoming president. There's tremendous upheaval going on.\\n\\nHe says that over the course of Network's trans-Atlantic run, he's learned the value of expressing anger. You think that, 'What is that going to solve?' But in truth it does. It releases the pressure valve. Somewhat. On some people just a little. On others maybe a lot. There's intrinsic value to that. To the human condition."}
{"original": "The Dust-Up Over Gibraltar: What's The Big Deal About The Little Peninsula?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup/Getty Images\\n\\nLet's get something straight up front: Spain and the U.K. are not going to war over Gibraltar.\\n\\nThat, at least, is what politicians from both countries have been carefully asserting since Michael Howard, a former British Conservative party leader, made a not-so-subtle suggestion Sunday that force would be on the table in some recent unpleasantness over the long-disputed peninsula.\\n\\nThirty-five years ago this week, another woman prime minister sent a task force halfway across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish-speaking country, Howard told an interviewer, referring to the brief 1982 Falklands War between the U.K. and Argentina, and I'm absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar.\\n\\nAsked about Howard's comment Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman made her answer plain, the Guardian reports: It isn't going to happen.\\n\\nMay herself laughed when asked by reporters whether she'd rule out war with Spain. She told reporters the fraught talk over Gibraltar — a tiny chunk of land contiguous with Spain but controlled by the U.K. — is merely part and parcel of British negotiations to leave the European Union. Those talks formally kicked off last week, when May triggered the U.K.'s departure.\\n\\nWhat we are doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them. We are going to talk to them about the best possible deal for the United Kingdom and for those countries, Spain included, May said.\\n\\nSomeone in the U.K. is losing their cool and there's no need for it, Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis also cautioned, when asked about Howard's comment.\\n\\nStill, the question bears asking: Why is it that a roughly 2.5-square-mile peninsula parked on the southwest tip of Europe — with just about 30,000 people on it — has international leaders so worked up?\\n\\nThe answer, as it turns out, can be taken in three parts:\\n\\nThe Brouhaha Over Brexit\\n\\nWhile there has been no lack of friction between the two countries over the past three centuries on the topic of Gibraltar — more on that in the next section — the point of contention that has stoked tensions lately pertains to (what else?) Brexit.\\n\\nShortly after May triggered Brexit, the EU issued a nine-page document that laid out its draft negotiating guidelines for the 27 countries remaining in the union. For the most part, those guidelines looked much as people expected — yet a surprising statement lurked near the end:\\n\\nAfter the United Kingdom leaves the union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nThat proposed condition came as unwelcome news to British lawmakers, who widely viewed it as giving Spain veto power over any agreement on Gibraltar's fate — and thus, an encroachment on British authority over the territory it has owned (despite occasional protests from Spain) since 1713.\\n\\nGibraltar is not a bargaining chip in these negotiations. Gibraltar belongs to the Gibraltarians and we want to stay British, Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said, according to the BBC.\\n\\nLikening Brexit to a divorce, he cast European Council President Donald Tusk as a cuckolded husband who is taking it out on the children.\\n\\ntoggle caption Rischgitz/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Backstory\\n\\nMay laughed off the prospect of war this time around — but the Rock of Gibraltar is no stranger to spilled blood.\\n\\nThe land mass doesn't boast much in the way of natural resources, but its position as a hinge point between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, standing between Europe and Africa, made it an attractive possession for the colonial powers.\\n\\nCaptured from the Spanish in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession, Gibraltar was ceded to the British in perpetuity in the Treaty of Utrecht, the peace that ultimately brought that fight to a close in 1713.\\n\\nNaturally, that was by no means the end of the dispute, which has manifested itself by turns as heated words, blockades and even further violence. Later that century, for instance, the Spanish launched a yearslong — and unsuccessful — siege that bequeathed no greater fruit than a rather stirring painting by John Trumbull.\\n\\ntoggle caption Metropolitan Museum of Art\\n\\nMore recently, Lauren Frayer reported for NPR that in 1969 Spanish dictator Francisco Franco closed the territory's border with Spain, effectively isolating it from all but sea and air travel. Spain maintained this policy on and off for another 16 years before the border was opened again.\\n\\nFor the Spanish, Gibraltar is an affront to their sense of national identity and their sense of sovereignty, Jack Straw, former British foreign secretary, told BBC Radio 4. It's a bit like having a part of Dover being owned by Spain.\\n\\nThe Brits On The Rock\\n\\nBut what do the Gibraltarians have to say about it?\\n\\nWell, even that is a tad complicated. Despite its geographical proximity to Spain, a visitor to Gibraltar would be forgiven for feeling much closer to London. People on the peninsula use British currency, pay taxes to British authorities, even boast London's distinctive red phone booths.\\n\\nIn fact, take away a map and the few facets of the scene that may give things away are the Mediterranean sun and omnipresence of apes — which, as Lauren notes, are the only ones to be found on the European continent.\\n\\ntoggle caption Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nWe've been British for 300 years, and we have a hostile neighbor. People here identify themselves at British, they feel British. The identity of this people is intimately linked to this rock, local newspaper editor Brian Reyes told Lauren in 2014. Sure, it's just a rock. But it's a place — it's a home. And it's a pretty iconic rock.\\n\\nIn 2002, partly at Straw's urging, Gibraltarians weighed in on whether they preferred Spain to share sovereignty over their territory. In that referendum, about 99 percent voted to remain with the U.K. Only 187 of people voted in favor of joining up with Spain, according to the Guardian.\\n\\nStill, the roughly 30,000 Gibraltarians, many of whom commute across the border into Spain for work, voted in similarly overwhelming numbers to remain in the EU — about 96 percent in the June 2016 Brexit referendum.\\n\\nBut Picardo warned that Spain should not take this in any way as an opening.\\n\\nSpain might like to use Gibraltar as a political pawn, the European Council may have allowed Spain to put this issue in this current draft of the guidelines, but Gibraltar is not going to be a political pawn of Brexit, he told British media Friday.\\n\\nGibraltar is going to be very prosperous and very successful and entirely British before, during and after Brexit."}

Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement that It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death as Afghans who served the U.S. mission continue to be systematically hunted down by the Taliban. The number of visas needed for those in danger far surpasses what's provided in this bill.\\n\\nShaheen, a Democrat, has partnered with Sen. John McCain, a Republican, to push for the program to continue, and both have condemned what they see as a shortsighted policy of limiting visas, making it more difficult for the U.S. government to persuade local allies to work with them.\\n\\nIt's not just a quid pro quo, 'Hey you help me out [and] I'll help you get to America,'  Marine veteran Zach Iscol told Quil. It's taking care of those who took care of us when we were in their country.\\n\\nLast month the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan asked Congress to send more troops to Afghanistan, where American soldiers have been assisting Afghan security forces since the U.S. formally ended its combat mission in 2014 and are increasingly drawn into battle there.\\n\\nThere are currently 8,400 U.S. service members deployed to Afghanistan.\\n\\nLast year, nine former Iraqi translators sued the federal government over delays in the program. Some had been waiting five years or more to get an answer about their visa applications.\\n\\nMac McEachin of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which has helped Afghans apply through the special visa programs in both Afghanistan and Iraq, said in a statement that he believes allowing the program to lapse could affect U.S. operations outside the two countries.\\n\\nThis news deals our ground efforts an especially harsh blow, as it comes on the heels of the announcement that troops from the 82nd Airborne will be deployed to Syria, he wrote. Now that the world has seen how we turn our backs on our Afghan allies, there is almost no chance that local allies in Syria will be inclined to work with us.\\n\\nThe collapse of the U.S. special visa program is part of a larger closing of U.S. borders to people fleeing war and political violence.\\n\\nLast week, President Trump signed a new executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries and slashing the total number of refugees who can be offered asylum in the U.S. from 110,000 to 50,000.\\n\\nAccording to the U.N. refugee agency, Afghans make up the second largest group of refugees in the world right now, after Syrians. About 2.7 million Afghan people and 4.9 million Syrian people have fled their homes and are considered refugees."}
{"original": "'The Obama Doctrine': Examining White House Foreign Policy\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Obama contends his biggest foreign policy mistake was actually a success. He said that to Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. Obama spoke of a choice he made in 2013. He backed away from ordering an attack on Syria. The president did not enforce a red line he had been understood to draw against Syria's use of chemical weapons. Jeffrey Goldberg says this is how the president talks of that decision now.\\n\\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Pretty much the worst reason to bomb someone is to prove that you're willing to bomb someone.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Obama spoke with Goldberg in the White House and even aboard Air Force One, the president settled on a couch as the plane descended toward Kuala Lumpur. Both the president and his critics think a lot about that Syria decision in 2013. It's on their minds even though Syria's government finally did agree to surrender chemical weapons.\\n\\nWhy did you think it was important to dig in and better understand that foreign policy decision a couple years later? More than that, even?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Because he told me that this was a hinge moment of his presidency. He suggested this very strongly to me, that this was the moment that he, quote, Broke with the Washington playbook, end quote. And I asked him what he meant by the Washington playbook, and he says, you know, there's literally a playbook on the shelf in the foreign policy establishment in the Pentagon, in the State Department that says if country X does this, then the United States does Y. And he believes that the playbook is over-militarized, that - and it's kind of a cruise missile playbook. If these people do this, then I'm going to fire this missile at them. He believes that the playbook also holds that the U.S. is responsible for management of the Middle East. And that's another core aspect of the Obama doctrine, is to question that underlying assumption that we've made for three decades or more that this is our main responsibility in the world - is to keep this under management. And so at that moment in 2013, a lot of different things are welling up inside of him. There's practical political considerations obviously, but there's also these broader themes, which is like, I don't want to be the manager of the Middle East. And so this is what he's thinking in that moment. And when he made that decision, he thought, I've finally broken with the Washington playbook.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You are delivering news to us here, Jeffery Goldberg, because this is a decision that had been endlessly criticized by the president's critics...\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...As a moment of weakness. Even the president's supporters have said they did not...\\n\\nGOLDBERG: ...Many ex-Cabinet members...\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...Have said, I did not believe in that decision. They've said that again and again and again; that this was a failure, that this cost American credibility in the world.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You're saying that the president not only defends that decision, but believes it was a success.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: The quote from the president - and I was somewhat taken aback the first time I heard him say this - is he's very proud of this moment. He's very proud of the moment he decided not to do the thing that everyone seemed to want him to do. So you can interpret this two ways. One is that's true. The other is that this is a master politician at work, and he's kind of doing a little bit of jujitsu - in other words, telling people, the moment that you think is my weakest moment as president is actually my best moment as president.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And yet you portray a president who is bothered that people do continue to focus on that moment of drawing the red line and then not...\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Yes.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...Not striking out. You've got a quote here that I wrote down - nobody remembers bin Laden anymore, the president says to you. Nobody talks about ordering me 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. The red line crisis, he said, is the point of the inverted pyramid upon which all other theories rest.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right.\\n\\nINSKEEP: What did he mean by that?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: He's clearly bothered by the fact that people think of him as a weak national security president. And his argument is - and this is true, what I'm about to say - is this president who has this reputation is the greatest terrorist hunter in the history of the American presidency. I mean, we just saw in the last week the 150 militants in Somalia wiped out by a U.S. strike. Who ordered that strike? There's a record there, and he...\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...This is a guy who used drones in ways that many people...\\n\\nGOLDBERG: ...This is a guy who has killed terrorists in seven or eight different countries.\\n\\nINSKEEP: There have been arguments made here in Washington that maybe this was the right decision for Syria, maybe it was the wrong decision for Syria, but that there are consequences that the president drew a red line, somebody defied that, and that the United States did not attack. Have there been larger consequences, negative consequences, for the United States?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: We won't know for years, I think.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Does the president acknowledge that there were larger consequences?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: The president does not believe in these credibility arguments the way a lot of people in the foreign policy establishment believe it. He does not believe that people are no longer scared of the United States. He believes, for instance, that Iran made the deal on nuclear weapons that it did because it understands the power of the United States.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Let me ask you about one more word. It's a word you chose to describe the president after sitting with him so many times. Why do you describe the president as fatalistic?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: One of the surprising things in these conversations was how fatalistic he is about the Middle East, especially considering where he was when he started as president. You know, one of his big first speeches was a speech in Cairo which was meant to reset relations with the Muslim world. And he had a lot of hope for the peace process, he had a lot of hope for transition and during the Arab Spring - the first days of the Arab Spring. But he has come to the conclusion that there's nothing that the United States can do. Nothing that would change systems in the Middle East, nothing the United States can do that would make the Middle East a better place. He believes it's a generational problem. He believes that the forces of fundamentalism and tribalism are so strong in the Middle East that the U.S. would be foolish to try to shape that region.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Jeffrey Goldberg's article based on several interviews with President Obama is in the Atlantic.

{"original": "How Presidents Wage War Without Congress\\n\\nThe Constitution limits the president's power to wage war but presidents have gotten around that and Congress has only rarely asserted itself successfully.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nLast week, the House of Representatives voted to require President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure now goes to the Senate, where its fate is less certain. And President Trump is not expected to sign anything that restricts his authority, which raises the question, what are the limits to a president's power to make war? We posed that question to senior Washington correspondent Ron Elving.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nFRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT: December 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy.\\n\\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Congress has not declared war on anyone since World War II.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Congress, with overwhelming acclaim, then voted the declaration of a state of war, and the president signed it three hours after this historic scene.\\n\\nELVING: Yet the U.S. has made war since then in many parts of the world. How can this be? The Constitution was very clear that the power to declare war belonged exclusively to Congress. But when it came to actually waging a war, the Constitution followed its pattern of dividing the power between the executive and legislative branches. The president was to be the commander in chief of the armed forces, but the Congress was to raise and support those forces. The president gave the orders, but Congress had to pay for it. Congress had to pass the appropriations bills, levy the taxes and pass the debt measures necessary to finance the fighting.\\n\\nThat system worked for about a century and a half. Outside of declared wars, there were occasional commitments of troops outside the borders of the U.S. under several presidents. But Congress sat still for all that, seeing it as less than actual war or calculating that there was little to be gained by opposing it. In the decades since World War II, however, the challenge to the constitutional separation of powers has grown far more consequential. Throughout the decades, presidents committed U.S. troops to fight communists in the fight we knew as the Cold War.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: In Tokyo, the United States moved swiftly to translate into action the United Nations' call to arms against the aggressor. American occupation troops in Japan are hurried to the defense of the Korean republic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Combat units of the United States Marine Corps arrive in Vietnam, joining other Marines already there.\\n\\nELVING: The peak in the pattern was Lyndon Johnson's Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 that led to the escalation of the Vietnam War.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLYNDON B JOHNSON: This new act of aggression, aimed directly at our own forces, again brings home to all of us in the United States the importance of the struggle for peace and security in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nELVING: Nearly a decade later, as that conflict had stretched into another president's second term, Congress rallied to reassert its constitutional role.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOHN CHANCELLOR: Good evening. The Congress of the United States, in a historic action today, made effective a limitation on the powers of the president to make war.\\n\\nELVING: In 1973, Democratic majorities in both chambers passed the War Powers Resolution, requiring the president to notify Congress within 48 hours when troops were sent into harm's way. That legislation also required presidents to end any foreign military action after 60 days unless Congress had declared war or passed an authorization for the use of military force, a phrase that's come to be known as an AUMF. Since then, however, the law has fallen short of its authors' intent, in part because presidents found ways to work around it and also because Congress has shown itself willing to follow the president's lead in matters of foreign conflict.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nFAITH DANIELS: There's a new war this morning in the Persian Gulf. Iraq turns to bloodshed to settle its oil price dispute with Kuwait.\\n\\nELVING: A different level of difficulty arose after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor country of Kuwait in 1990.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nDEBORAH NORVILLE: This is the seventh week of Operation Desert Shield, and now there are about 150,000 American military in the region. And the number is growing every day.\\n\\nELVING: President George H.W. Bush deployed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf region before Congress had taken a vote to authorize it.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGEORGE H W BUSH: I know what it's like to have fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle, and it's only the president that should be asked to make the decision.\\n\\nELVING: Congress did authorize that use of force by relatively narrow margins in January of 1991, and the first Persian Gulf War began just days later. Since then, we have seen presidents outmaneuver Congress again and again - President Bill Clinton in the Balkans, and later, President Obama battling ISIS in Iraq and Syria. President George W. Bush called for two authorizations for the use of military force, the first just days after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Congress immediately approved military action against terrorists, wherever they might be, and Bush soon sent forces to Afghanistan.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGEORGE W BUSH: Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against al-Qaida terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.\\n\\nELVING: The following year, Congress debated and approved another authorization, this one focusing on Iraq.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLISA MYERS: The debate was emotional. But in the end, the vote empowering President Bush to go to war with Iraq was larger than the vote 11 years ago authorizing his father to take on Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nELVING: One or both of these measures has been cited to justify literally thousands of drone strikes and other military actions against those the U.S. has labeled terrorists ever since...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It appears the U.S. military has launched a missile strike in Iraq.\\n\\nELVING: ...Including the one that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani this month.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBRENNAN: A revered Iranian general and one of that country's most powerful military leaders. He is considered by the U.S. to be a terrorist.\\n\\nELVING: President Trump has often described Bush's 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq as, quote, the worst single mistake in the history of U.S. foreign policy. But President Bush can at least argue he submitted his request to Congress before his invasion of Iraq began. Trump has yet to seek congressional approval for any of his actions in the Middle East...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLESTER HOLT: Good evening. Nearly 3,000 additional American troops have been ordered to the Middle East tonight amid a dangerous...\\n\\nELVING: ...And, in the latest instance, did not even inform congressional leaders of his plans, other than via Twitter. He said some of his opponents among the leaders in Congress could not be trusted with the information. In that atmosphere of mutual distrust, it is hard to see how the founding fathers' ideal of shared powers could succeed in war-making or any other aspect of national policy.\\n\\nRon Elving, NPR News, Washington.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SNARKY PUPPY'S SHOFUKAN)\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "Access To Military Sites Debated As White House Reconsiders Iran Nuclear Deal\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption STR/AFP/Getty Images STR/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nTwo deadlines are approaching that may signal the fate of the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The agreement saw Iran sharply curtail its nuclear program and allow extensive inspections in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\\n\\nSept. 14 is the deadline for the Trump administration to decide whether it will continue to waive Iranian sanctions under the deal. The sanctions were passed by Congress and go into effect unless they're waived every few months — which Trump has done previously.\\n\\nThe administration also faces an Oct. 15 deadline to certify whether Iran remains in compliance with the nuclear deal. That certification requirement is not part of the deal but was imposed by Congress. That is, when the Obama administration signed the deal, Congress required him to say every three months whether he believed Iran was in compliance. It was a way for members of Congress to hold Obama to account for a deal many opposed.\\n\\nEarlier this month, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley essentially made the case for decertifying Iran. She told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington that President Trump must consider not just issues covered by the deal — Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, a nuclear fuel — but Tehran's aggressive policies in the region and its ongoing tests of ballistic missiles.\\n\\nHaley stopped short, though, of saying the administration was poised to walk away from the deal.\\n\\nIf the president chooses not to certify Iranian compliance, she said, that does not mean the United States is withdrawing from the JCPOA. There have been reports that there's a debate going on within the Trump administration regarding whether to decertify.\\n\\nThe recent focus of those against the deal seems to be on Iran's military sites, with critics saying inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency are failing to routinely inspect them along with Iran's declared nuclear facilities.\\n\\nIAEA Director-General Yukia Amano defends the verification regime as the most robust being conducted anywhere today and insists that military sites are not off-limits.\\n\\nIranian officials say just the opposite.\\n\\nNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites, Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters in Iran recently, calling the push for such inspections a threat to its national security. Velayati is an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\\n\\nSo who is right?\\n\\nHow it works\\n\\nThe IAEA inspectors are charged with ensuring that no potential nuclear fuel — highly enriched uranium and plutonium are the two commonly used sources — is being diverted to a covert nuclear weapons program. Under something called the Additional Protocol, which Iran accepted as part of the JCPOA, inspectors can request access to undeclared sites, including military sites. But the agreement spells out a series of steps to gain that access that could take as long as 24 days to complete.\\n\\nCritics contend that is far too long to wait.\\n\\nDavid Albright with the Institute for Science and International Security and former IAEA official Olli Heinonen co-authored a recent paper calling for greater access to Iran's military sites. They zeroed in on one section — Section T in Annex 1 — that deals with verifying that Iran hasn't acquired dual use technology that could serve either a peaceful nuclear purpose or weapons development.\\n\\nAlbright and Heinonen suggest that Iran may be in violation of some of these restrictions, and they argue that the IAEA should inspect Iranian military sites as a regular part of enforcing this part of the agreement, not treat such inspections as special cases used only in response to evidence of a specific violation.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the IAEA reported that its verification of Iran's nuclear commitments includes those set out in various sections of the agreement — including Section T — but Albright and Heinonen contend truly effective verification requires the establishment of a routine inspection approach.\\n\\nThe IAEA chief says the JCPOA is working and that it has all the authority it needs. Amano told reporters in Vienna this week that special access is already happening on a regular basis.\\n\\nAlready we have had many [visits] and we will continue to have access, he said, adding that we do not distinguish between civilian sites and military ones.\\n\\nWhat Amano did not say, however, is whether military sites are currently being inspected — something critics of the deal might seize upon.\\n\\nHe also has said that inspectors need a reason to request access to undeclared sites, and the JCPOA section on access states that if the IAEA has concerns [emphasis added] regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities, then it can request to see undeclared — i.e., military — sites. It's unclear what kind of reason or evidence the IAEA would consider sufficient.\\n\\nSupporters of the JCPOA such as Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, say the remarkable access the West now has to Iran's nuclear program via the deal and the IAEA inspections should not be thrown away lightly.\\n\\nThe IAEA has never had better access to Iran's military sites, says Vaez. If the Trump administration loses this unprecedented access ... it will soon wish for it.\\n\\nVaez adds that derailing the JCPOA now could also have unintended consequences.\\n\\nIf the Trump administration kills the deal with Iran, [a deal] that is working and [that] the rest of the international community is highly satisfied with, he says, it should forget about peacefully settling the nuclear standoff with North Korea.\\n\\nHow this could play out\\n\\nIf the White House decides not to waive the sanctions this week, that could throw the deal in doubt immediately. But assuming the sanctions are waived on Thursday, certification becomes the next question.\\n\\nAs Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., pointed out, decertifying Iran next month wouldn't automatically pull the U.S. out of the JCPOA. But some worry it could provoke an Iranian reaction that would ultimately lead to the agreement's demise.\\n\\nThere's also another possibility: that the Trump administration will continue to waive sanctions against Iran, and then decertify. That would very likely shift the focus to Tehran — and to Congress, which could move to impose new sanctions on Iran."}
{"original": "How Many Levels Can You Count In The Ryan-Trump Chess Game?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP\\n\\nIf you've ever played three-dimensional chess, you have some notion of what Paul Ryan is dealing with in his political game with Donald Trump.\\n\\nExcept that Ryan's dilemma has more than just three dimensions.\\n\\nOn the first level, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is the highest federal officeholder in the Republican Party. In this role, he is slated to be the chairman of the party's national convention in July. And in both roles, it is presumed he will back the party's nominee for president.\\n\\nThat nominee is now all but certain to be Trump. So it would seem time for the speaker to salute and fall in line. To refuse, or even hesitate, creates uncertainty and turmoil in the party. It also provokes endless media speculation.\\n\\nBut for Ryan, that's not the only level of the game. Being speaker also makes Ryan the protector of 247 Republican seats in the current House, every last one of which will be on the ballot in November. If Trump turns out to be a disaster — or even a middleweight burden for down ballot candidates — the GOP could lose seats in swing districts. Granted, there are precious few swing districts left, but even incumbents in slightly less-safe seats will worry.\\n\\nBeyond that, the game just gets more complicated.\\n\\nRyan is widely regarded as a thought leader in his party and in the conservative movement more generally. After meeting with Trump this week, he began his news conference with extensive remarks about addressing the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nHe speaks often of principles, and he seems to mean it. He has striven to reconcile his Catholic faith and concern for the poor with his admiration for Ayn Rand and a libertarian philosophy of small government and self-reliance.\\n\\nHe is a constitutionalist, an advocate of separated powers and restraints on presidential authority. And he has argued for cutting back on future commitments for Social Security and Medicaid to get budget deficits under control.\\n\\nTrump has paid at least lip service to some of these ideas, at least at times. But he has also promised enormous power moves such as deporting 11 million people and building a monster wall and barring immigrants who are Muslims. The way he talks about trade and foreign policy suggests he plans to move in decisive fashion, Congress notwithstanding. He has denounced Ryan's approach to entitlements as political suicide.\\n\\nVisibly discomfited by much of this throughout the campaign, Ryan spoke out most forcefully in reaction to Trump's Muslim ban: That is not what this party stands for, Ryan said in December, and more importantly it's not what this country stands for.\\n\\nBeyond any of these issues or past disagreements, Ryan's complex convictions are hard to reconcile with Trump's breathtaking disregard for consistency or systematic thinking.\\n\\nClearly, there's more than enough contradiction in all this for a three-dimensional chess board. Yet Ryan's calculations do not stop there.\\n\\nEven as speaker, Ryan remains the representative of the 1st District of Wisconsin, a mix of rural communities and small cities wedged into the southeastern corner of the state between Milwaukee to the north and metro Chicago to the south. Ryan's approval numbers have been stratospheric there, and he has little reason to fear his intraparty opponent on the ballot in August — even if Sarah Palin makes good on her threat to campaign for the challenger.\\n\\nBut it gets more complicated the longer Ryan withholds his blessing for Trump's nomination. The district went for Ted Cruz in the April 5 primary by 19 points, but since Cruz dropped out and Trump became the de facto nominee, fresh polling has shown 1st District Republicans coming around. One poll found them split almost evenly between favorable and unfavorable feelings toward Trump, and a clear majority wanted Ryan to endorse him.\\n\\nOne 1st District resident who has done so is Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha, just 70 miles east of Ryan's home in Janesville. Priebus happens to be the chairman of the Republican National Committee. So he was quick to call on his home state neighbor after Ryan went public with his ambivalence toward Trump on May 5. Priebus urged Ryan to join him on the Trump train, and he brokered the meeting between speaker and nominee on Thursday at Republican headquarters on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nPriebus and the others in this drama have been circumspect about the details of their conversations, but it seems likely the party chairman reminded his longtime friend of the changing sentiments toward Trump back home — and nationally.\\n\\nRyan has to be seeing the same clear message in polling done so far among Republicans nationwide. It warns that if Ryan stays off the bandwagon too long he risks alienating party stalwarts with long memories.\\n\\nThat would matter, of course, if Ryan pursues a presidential campaign of his own in 2020 or beyond. Ryan was Mitt Romney's running mate four years ago, at the tender age of 42. While he has said repeatedly he was not interested in running for president this year, he is widely regarded as a prospective candidate at some point in the future.\\n\\nUnless he is an unusual politician indeed, Ryan has to be thinking about how a Trump presidency would affect his own future. If he links himself with the unpredictable outsider, he may be associating himself with a divisive and disastrous campaign.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if he refuses, how does he work with a President Trump? And won't he be risking the wrath of Trump's staunchest supporters in the event of a Trump defeat? Ryan might find himself blamed, at least in part, not only for Trump's loss but for whatever happens to the country under a President Hillary Clinton or a President Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nOf course the same hazards might apply to any other prominent Republican who fails to endorse Trump or to back him wholeheartedly. Cruz and Marco Rubio might fall in this category.\\n\\nBut Ryan's position remains uniquely exposed, if only because as speaker his position is unique — both as a party symbol and as a focal point for its functionality."}
{"original": "Biden Plans To Stop Holding Back COVID-19 Vaccines\\n\\nPresident-elect Biden plans to release almost all available doses of COVID-19 vaccines, stepping away from the Trump administration policy to hold back about half of the supplies for booster shots.\\n\\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\\n\\nAll right. We're going to turn now to NPR health correspondent Rob Stein, who's been listening in and joins us now. Hey, Rob.\\n\\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Hey there, Ailsa.\\n\\nCHANG: You just heard Dr. Gawande describe this plan to stop holding vaccine back. Is this a good idea, according to people that you have been talking to?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah, good question. So there's a really intense debate going on about this. And, you know, some public health experts and scientists that I've been talking to have been - say they've been pushing for this for quite some time. They say the most important thing right now is to get the vaccine into as many people as fast as possible. And while two shots are better than one, one shot is still pretty good, and you'd end up saving more lives if more people get one shot than waiting for fewer people to get two.\\n\\nI talked about this today with Marc Lipsitch at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He says it's become even more urgent because of the emergence of these new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.\\n\\nMARC LIPSITCH: As the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country, it's a race against time. And the faster we get vaccine out, the better.\\n\\nCHANG: OK. Well, you heard me ask Dr. Gawande about some problems that might arise, like not enough vaccine...\\n\\nSTEIN: Right.\\n\\nCHANG: ...For second doses.\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah.\\n\\nCHANG: Are there other concerns?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah. So as you said, the critics say the big problem right now is not not having enough vaccine; the big problem is getting the vaccine that's out there actually into people's arms. So that should be the focus. But there are also big worries about, as you mentioned, not having enough vaccine to make sure everyone gets that second shot. You know, no one knows how helpful the protection from one shot will really be. You know, how long will it last? How strong will it be? And a spokesman for Operation Warp Speed released a statement today that was really sharply critical of Biden's plans if it threatens that booster.\\n\\nI talked about this with Angela Rasmussen. She's a virologist at Georgetown.\\n\\nANGELA RASMUSSEN: The danger is that the vaccines might actually be, long term, less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use. It could be potentially really harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.\\n\\nSTEIN: And Rasmussen and others also worry that if too many people end up only getting that one shot and that ends up only giving them a very weak protection, it could actually kind of backfire by, you know, helping new variants of the virus evolve that could outsmart the vaccines. Here's Angela Rasmussen again.\\n\\nRASMUSSEN: People might have sort of subpar vaccine responses, and that could allow for the selection of variants that might be able to evade the immune responses produced by the vaccine.\\n\\nCHANG: And real quick, Rob - what are other people saying about those concerns?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah, so I talked to Dr. Anthony Fauci from the NIH about this this afternoon. And he, you know, said what Dr. Gawande said - that there are absolutely no plans to abandon the two-shot regimen, that the new administration is committed to that. And President-elect Biden's press secretary told reporters today that if necessary, the new administration would invoke the Defense Production Act, if necessary, to compel the companies to do what's necessary to make sure those second shots are there.\\n\\nCHANG: That is NPR's Rob Stein. Thank you, Rob.\\n\\nSTEIN: You bet.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Biden's National Security, Foreign Policy Nominees Face Senate Confirmation Hearings\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nThe faces of the incoming Biden administration's national security team came into focus today with Senate confirmation hearings. On deck were nominees for intelligence, defense, also foreign policy roles. Senators questioned the nominees on how their policies might differ from those of their predecessors. Among our reporters watching - NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre and diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen.\\n\\nHello to you both.\\n\\nMICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\\n\\nGREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\\n\\nKELLY: Greg, I'm going to let you start. Avril Haines, who is poised to become the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence, the first female head of U.S. intelligence, she's had a somewhat unusual journey to get her to this point. Tell us about her.\\n\\nMYRE: Yeah, she certainly has. She was an only child growing up in New York City. And when she graduated from high school, she spent a year at a judo academy in Japan. And then she studied physics at the University of Chicago. She loved to build things, including the avionics on a used Cessna plane, which she planned to fly from Maine to Europe with her flying instructor. They had to make an emergency landing in Canada. And a little bit later, she married her flight instructor. But she was in her early 30s by the time she graduated from Georgetown Law School and then began this quick rise in the government. One of her jobs was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where she got to know the chairman, Senator Joe Biden. She followed Biden to the White House, worked on the National Security Council, was in the No. 2 at the CIA. And now he's picked her to be the first woman to be director of national intelligence.\\n\\nKELLY: So that is the path she has taken to get here. At her actual hearing today, did she give much of an indication of what she will focus on in this job?\\n\\nMYRE: She really stressed rebuilding the relationship between the intelligence community and the president. I mean, as we know, President Trump has been at odds with the intelligence community in many ways since Day 1. He's had four directors of national intelligence. The current one, John Ratcliffe, has been widely criticized for politicizing intelligence. Haines didn't mention him by name, but here's what she did say.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nAVRIL HAINES: To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever.\\n\\nMYRE: She also stressed that China would be a real priority with the rise of its military, its extensive spying network, its theft of intellectual property. But the hearing overall was quite cordial, and I would certainly expect her to be confirmed pretty easily and quickly.\\n\\nKELLY: All right, Michele, let's get you in here. Give us a little bit on Tony Blinken - his background, why Joe Biden has nominated him to be the nation's top diplomat, secretary of state.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Right. Well, he goes way back with Biden, so that's one reason. They worked together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is the committee that's considering Blinken's nomination to be secretary of state. He's steeped in foreign policy. He speaks French from his time living in Paris. His uncle and his father were ambassadors. He also talks a lot about his other family members. His grandfather fled the pogroms and found refuge here in America. His stepfather was a Holocaust survivor who was rescued by an African American GI. And he says it's that kind of history that got him interested in government service. Let's take a listen.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nANTONY BLINKEN: I view that tradition as something of a sacred duty - payment on the debt that our family owes to the nation that gave so many of my relatives refuge and extraordinary opportunities across the generations.\\n\\nKELEMEN: And that's what Blinken says he wants to do. He says America shouldn't - this is what America means to the world. He hopes to restore America's credibility, revitalize alliances, all in the wake of the Trump era.\\n\\nKELLY: Yeah. It is just so different, so strikingly different in tone and message from the outgoing administration, which leads me to this. If he's confirmed, Blinken will succeed Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Where might we see the biggest differences in how he runs the State Department?\\n\\nKELEMEN: Well, a big difference is stylistic, Mary Louise. You know, remember; Pompeo talks about swagger. Blinken talks about leading with both confidence and humility because the U.S. needs partners to solve challenges, so he's much less ideological. He's also talked about the need for a more diverse State Department to represent the face of America, while Pompeo tweeted just today - and this is a quote - woke-ism and multiculturalism - they're not who America is. That was on Pompeo's official State Department Twitter account. So I think you'll see a big change in tone.\\n\\nThere are also going to be policy differences. Blinken talks about the need to be at the table, while the Trump administration left the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord and pulled funding from the World Health Organization. There is one thing that Blinken said today that the Trump administration got right, and that is getting tough on China. But he said the U.S. needs to counter China from a position of strength. And again, that means working with allies not, in his words, denigrating them.\\n\\nKELLY: Let's see if we can get one more nominee in here. Greg, let's talk about Lloyd Austin, retired four-star Army general. He would be the first Black secretary of defense. Speak to the significance of that.\\n\\nMYRE: Well, that would be very significant. It really sends an important message at a time when more than 40% of the military is made up of minorities, but it has very few senior Black leaders. Now, Austin's resume is quite impressive. He was born in Alabama in the 1950s, grew up in Georgia. He attended West Point and held a lot of important positions as he rose through the ranks. He was the first Black head of Central Command, which is responsible for the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He led the start of the campaign against ISIS in 2014. So this certainly reflects the military's focus on the past two decades. But as we noted earlier, some say the focus should be more on China these days and U.S. naval power in the Pacific and not on land wars in the Middle East.\\n\\nKELLY: We should note quickly before we move on, Lloyd Austin will have to clear an additional hurdle before he can become defense secretary. He needs a special waiver. Explain, Greg.\\n\\nMYRE: Right. There's a rule you must be out of uniform, out of the military for seven years before you can become Pentagon chief. And Austin retired just five years ago. Therefore, he'll need this waiver, which would require support in both the full House and the full Senate. Those votes are expected in coming days. But separate from today's confirmation hearing, Austin addressed this in his opening statement today.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLLOYD AUSTIN: I was a general and a soldier, and I'm proud of that. But today I appear before you as a citizen, the son of a postal worker and a homemaker from Thomasville, Ga. And I'm proud of that too. And if you confirm me, I am prepared to serve now as a civilian.\\n\\nMYRE: He would be only the third defense secretary to receive such a waiver. Jim Mattis in 2017 was one of the others. And some in Congress, both Democrats and Republican, say they don't want this to become the norm.\\n\\nKELLY: Michele, I'm going to give you the last word. As you tried to keep your eye on all these hearings today, did you land on whether there's any unifying thread there?\\n\\nKELEMEN: Well, they're all people that are - that Biden's been very close to. They all stress this kind of sense of professionalism, getting professionalism back in government service and the need to reinvigorate alliances around the world. And they have a whole lot of challenges ahead to do that.\\n\\nKELLY: That is Michele Kelemen. She covers the State Department and diplomacy for NPR. And Greg Myre, our national security correspondent - thanks, you two.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Thank you.\\n\\nMYRE: My pleasure.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Last 4 Children Detained On Nauru Are Heading To The U.S.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Oxenham/AP Jason Oxenham/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 5:08 p.m. ET\\n\\nAustralia says the last four asylum-seeking children held in its detention centers on the island nation of Nauru are to be transferred to the United States.\\n\\nThe country has faced years of criticism from human rights advocates over the health of asylum-seekers and the condition of detention facilities on the island. Amnesty International and other groups have described a mental health crisis where self-harm is common.\\n\\nNauru The tiny island nation is just 8 square miles and has only 10,000 citizens.\\n\\nThe transfer is part of a deal between Australia and the U.S., under the Obama administration, in which the U.S. agreed to accept some 1,250 refugees. Less than a month after President Trump took office, he blasted the agreement as a dumb deal — nevertheless, refugees started to be transferred to the U.S. in September 2017.\\n\\nRefugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea continue to arrive in the United States, a State Department spokesperson told NPR. Nearly 500 refugees from these locations have been resettled to date. These refugees have been subject to the same stringent vetting procedures as other refugees from around the world.\\n\\nThe spokesperson did not provide specific information about Australia's statement that these four children are scheduled for transfer.\\n\\nThe Australian government implemented a stricter border policy in 2013, the centerpiece of which is No-one who travels illegally to Australia by boat will be allowed to remain in Australia.\\n\\nAfter that, Australian authorities routinely began to intercept asylum-seekers and bring them to detention facilities on Nauru or to a detention center on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, where single men are held. They would then be detained there indefinitely.\\n\\nWith the last four children booked to leave for the US, every asylum seeker child will now be off Nauru, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Twitter. Our strong border protection policies have enabled us to secure our borders, stop the boats and the tragic drownings at sea while getting children out of detention and off Nauru without putting our stronger borders at risk. We have got the balance right.\\n\\nMorrison, leader of Australia's Liberal Party, became prime minister last August. He said in a statement that there were 109 asylum-seeker children on the island when he took office and that his government has been working quietly and methodically through this process.\\n\\nLocal advocates from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre also said that all of the critically sick children detained by the Australian government on Nauru were now receiving the medical care they need in Australia.\\n\\nThey say it has been a long road. In public the Government will call this a win and boast about evacuating this last child for urgent medical care but behind the scenes we have had to fight in the courts or threaten legal action to evacuate every single one of these sick children and their families, David Burke, senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre, said in a statement.\\n\\nThe ASRC said in August that nearly 30 percent of the remaining children were suffering from symptoms of Traumatic Withdrawal Syndrome.\\n\\nIt is most commonly seen in children and young adolescents, and has the clinical features dramatic social withdrawal, with severe reduction or inability to walk, talk, eat, and drink, self-care or socialise, it said.\\n\\nIt added: These children cannot recover on Nauru because ... Nauru is the cause of their trauma.\\n\\nWhile there will soon be no more children in the centers, Reuters reports that an estimated 1,000 people remain held."}

Many of them - many dog owners buy pet insurance to cover expenses in case of an injury to their dog. But pet owners in Canada are furious that their policies from one company don't cover injuries caused by what?\\n\\nLUKE BURBANK: If I use my dog as a sort of jumping off point, it would be injuries sustained while a deep, deep exploration of one's own backside.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: That'd be terrible if your dog was doing that and all of a sudden.

{"original": "Her Search For Her Mother Touches An Entire Chinese City\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jenna Cook Courtesy of Jenna Cook\\n\\nJenna Cook was born in China and abandoned on a street in the huge city of Wuhan in 1992 when she was just a baby.\\n\\nCook was adopted by a single American woman, a schoolteacher in Massachusetts, and later co-adopted by her godmother, who is her mother's partner.\\n\\nCook was accepted at Yale University, and at 20, she decided to go back to Wuhan in search of her birth mother.\\n\\nA local newspaper in Wuhan wrote an article about her, touching off a strong response in the city and far beyond. Cook says she was contacted by people in every province in China. Some said they had given up children and others said they were simply taken by her quest.\\n\\nCook ultimately met with 50 families to see if she was their daughter.\\n\\nIn those talks, she discovered many things, including the collective pain of Chinese families who had given up children. In most cases, the families had wanted a boy and decided to give up the child when it turned out to be a girl.\\n\\nHer efforts in China became her college thesis at Yale and an article in Foreign Policy. She spoke about her experience with Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Jenna Cook\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nOn how she went about searching\\n\\nMaybe it was really naive of me, but I was hoping that maybe somebody would see my face and think, Oh, she kind of looks like my cousin, or something like that. Like maybe my own body could serve as a type of evidence of my family, of where I come from, my own genes. I also ended up publicizing the story in Wuhan through the newspapers and through the television.\\n\\nOn who came to see her\\n\\nIn the end we met with almost 50 families that summer. So we heard 50 different stories, and I imagined that it would be mostly women, but I was definitely wrong. There were birth mothers who came alone, but there were also many birth fathers who came alone, and some families brought like the entire family. There would be moms and dads with the grandparents and then other siblings and then the grandkids. There would be like eight or nine people in the room. It was really incredible.\\n\\nOn what she heard from birth families\\n\\nIf I had to kind of extract one coherent narrative, I think they talked a lot about missing this daughter and they really worried about her. They wanted to know if she had survived and if she was OK — kind of like people coming out of a war or refugees or someone emerging from a large disaster and just wondering if the other side had also survived as they had.\\n\\nOn parents who hoped she might be their daughter\\n\\nOne birth mother brought a piece of cloth. She had used the cloth 20 years ago to sew a baby suit for the day that she and her daughter would part. And then she hoped that if she and her daughter were to reunite later, her daughter would have the baby suit and then she would have the scrap. It would be kind of like a lock and key. But I definitely didn't have such a baby suit.\\n\\nOn what she heard from mothers who gave up a baby\\n\\nFor most people it was the combination of needing a son, wanting a son, and also the fact that they already had so many children. I have to say, it was surprising, because in the U.S. we hear one-child policy, we think, Oh, there's just one child that the families kept. But I don't think I met any families with one child. They all had like three, four, five, six, seven or even eight children, and there was a pattern in that most of the children of higher birth order were female and then they would keep having children until they had a son. And so the missing daughter was usually not the first daughter. They would usually keep that one. The missing daughter was usually the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc.\\n\\nOn whether she found her birth family\\n\\nI didn't. But I feel like going through the search and listening to the different stories has given me some idea of who they might be or what kinds of things they might have confronted. I am still looking but in a less active way. My DNA was left at a local police station. I figure I just kind of leave it up to fate.\\n\\nI put one copy of the search poster in my file at the orphanage. It was like the first 30 pages were all other people writing about me, this small infant with no voice and really no ability to choose her destination or fate in the world. And to be able to come back 20 years later with a search poster that I had written about myself and to kind of add that in as the last page, that was really something that felt satisfying."}
{"original": "TAMARA KEITH, HOST:\\n\\nExciting news before we start the show - we are doing a live taping of our podcast at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on November 8. Go to nprpresents.org to get your tickets now. Now let's talk about that Democratic debate in Texas that was hosted by ABC News.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, FLAWLESS)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) I'm out that H-town, coming, coming down.\\n\\nKEITH: Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\\n\\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: I'm Scott Detrow. I cover the campaign.\\n\\nAYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I also cover the White House.\\n\\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent.\\n\\nKEITH: And, of course, that is Houston's own Beyonce Knowles instead of our regular theme music. And the time now is 11:23 p.m. on Thursday, September 12. The third Democratic debate just ended a bit ago. And I'm here in studio in D.C. with Ron. Hey, Ron.\\n\\nELVING: Good to be here with you, Tam.\\n\\nKEITH: Scott and Ayesha, where are you right now?\\n\\nDETROW: So I am looking down over the debate room. It's in a gym on campus. And I am on the little indoor running track hovering above the gym, looking down on all the spin.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKEITH: Ayesha?\\n\\nELVING: Scott hovering.\\n\\nRASCOE: I'm in my bedroom, which is very messy.\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter).\\n\\nRASCOE: So it's a lot of mess. I'm looking at a lot of mess.\\n\\nKEITH: But, you know, what is great about a messy bedroom is there are more clothes on the floor to dampen the sound and make it sound more like a studio.\\n\\nDETROW: Tam, you are such a thorough journalist that you felt the need to say Knowles when you said that was Beyonce Knowles.\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter).\\n\\nDETROW: Like, oh, I thought it was Beyonce Smith. OK.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKEITH: All right. So we are all here tonight to break down the key moments from this, the, third Democratic debate. But first let us do our traditional thing by running through all of the candidates who are on the stage in order of their speaking time. Ayesha.\\n\\nRASCOE: Yes. So at the very top - but this is just time-wise, speaking-time-wise - former Vice President Joe Biden. And he clocked in at 17 minutes, eight seconds. And right behind him came Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who clocked in at 16 minutes, 38 seconds. So after them, in kind of descending order, you have Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, California Senator Kamala Harris, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. And businessman Andrew Yang clocked in at the very end with eight minutes, one second.\\n\\nKEITH: All right. So, Ron, Scott, Ayesha, this is the third of these debates. What was - Ron, I'll start with you. What was your big takeaway from this?\\n\\nELVING: Unlike the first two rounds of these debates, even though there were 10 people on stage still, the way it was structured, the candidates each had a little bit more time to talk, a little more time for interchange and clarity. It seemed like - and more healthy energy. There was more energy. It was a slightly more positive energy with one or two exceptions. Almost all the candidates had some strong moments. Almost all of them had some weak moments. I thought Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren all helped themselves distinctively tonight. I didn't think Julian Castro on balance, although he had some strong moments, will come out of this stronger or Andrew Yang or, frankly, Kamala Harris, who continues to disappoint, perhaps in comparison to her one strongest performance in the first round of the debate.\\n\\nDETROW: Agreed with almost everything Ron said, which is, you know, not new.\\n\\nKEITH: If this were a presidential debate, I'd be, like, but, Scott, tell me where you disagreed with Ron.\\n\\nDETROW: I have two main thoughts. Like Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to reject the premise of your question and say my own thoughts.\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter).\\n\\nDETROW: First of all, I think that this was kind of a status quo debate. I don't think anything tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates' fortunes. I think one really notable thing is that this evening showed that Joe Biden has really affected the conversation about health care. For months and months, Bernie Sanders really set the tone for health care. It was, do you agree with Bernie or disagree with Bernie? And most candidates said that, yeah, I agree with Bernie or at least big chunks of what Bernie's trying to do when it comes to Medicare for All and in some forms of the going away with private health insurance.\\n\\nOver the last couple months, Joe Biden has really framed that as blowing up Obamacare, undoing the Affordable Care Act - and saying, I'm the one who wants to build on Obamacare. Other people want to tear it down. So it was interesting to me that, tonight, Joe Biden made that point on stage saying, she's with Bernie, but I'm with Obama, speaking about Warren's support for Sanders' plan. But then seeing so many of the other candidates make pains to say, thanks, Barack Obama.\\n\\nI think Barack Obama took a big first step. I really appreciated what Barack Obama did - and then criticized aspects of Sanders' plan. So clearly, I think, many candidates are saying Joe Biden might have a point here that voters are latching on to. And I need to moderate my health care position just a little bit.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. And that was my other takeaway, which is not a big takeaway, but that, you know, in past debates, there was at times some distancing from former President Obama. In this debate, there was so much embracing of President Obama.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: The senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack.\\n\\nELIZABETH WARREN: We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally...\\n\\nKAMALA HARRIS: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for...\\n\\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: ...I favor is something that - what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.\\n\\nJULIAN CASTRO: I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\\n\\nHARRIS: ...Say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we, can't, let's say, yes, we can (laughter).\\n\\nKEITH: And that, of course, is a famous line from President Obama's first election campaign. It was his whole theme. Ayesha, what stood out to you from this debate?\\n\\nRASCOE: What stood out to me was how aggressive Joe Biden was. And to me, this was one of the first debates where he really seemed to act as if he were the front-runner. In the other ones, especially in that first one, which, I think most people agreed, was not a strong performance for Joe Biden, he kind of leaned back a bit. But in this one, he was aggressive. There were moments - and really just trying to set the tone instead of just responding.\\n\\nYou know, he went after Bernie Sanders when it came to the health care debate, saying, oh you think that once employers don't have to provide health care or aren't providing health care that they're just going to give those savings back to the employers. You know, you say you're a socialist. You have a lot of faith in the private sector. I'm paraphrasing.\\n\\nAnd then also, just when he obviously had that moment in the first debate where he wouldn't go over the time limit, and he said, I'm done. He stopped himself. But in this one, he's like, I'm going for it. Everybody else is doing it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nRASCOE: And he kept going. So that, to me, stood out. He definitely had more energy. We don't want to talk about low energy. He had more energy in this debate.\\n\\nDETROW: Definitely.\\n\\nELVING: And let's face it - this was three hours long. It took some energy just to watch it.\\n\\nRASCOE: Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nELVING: Imagine being out there on the - in the ring and having everybody directing most of their negative energy mostly towards Biden and having all of the tension that goes with one of these events and being on your feet like that for three hours. That would test anyone, let alone someone who's about to be 77.\\n\\nKEITH: One of the areas where he was particularly aggressive on policy was health care. And earlier, we heard a little clip where he made a comparison. You know, you're for Bernie. I'm for Barack. Let's hear a bit more of that.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBIDEN: I think we should have a debate on health care. I think - I know that the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way - we add to it, replace everything that's been cut. Add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.\\n\\nKEITH: And the senator he is referring to is Senator Elizabeth Warren, who supports a version of Medicare for All or actually just Medicare for All. But when she was asked sort of specifically about, well, what will this mean for middle-class taxes? - she did, you know, a bit of a boxing move and jumped out of the way.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nWARREN: What families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with and understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.\\n\\nELVING: The question, of course, here was, are you going to raise taxes? And, of course, the answer is inevitably yes. But she is saying, let's look at the total picture. Families are going to be better off. Their costs overall are going to be lower. And if they are paying a little more in tax, look at the people who are going to be paying a lot more in tax. And let's talk about the big corporations. And let's talk the very richest taxpayers. We're really going to go after them. As for the middle class, well, they'll have to chip in more in taxes, but they'll save so much more in their other costs. That's the pitch.\\n\\nRASCOE: But she didn't say that explicitly, though. And I was struck by how they were trying to get her on that point, and she just wouldn't say she wouldn't say that...\\n\\nELVING: She wouldn't say the word taxes.\\n\\nRASCOE: ...Explicitly that raising taxes.\\n\\nELVING: Would not say the word.\\n\\nRASCOE: No.\\n\\nELVING: Would not say taxes, no.\\n\\nKEITH: One of the moments that stands out from this debate was sort of health care adjacent in that they were talking about health care, but it really seemed like former HUD Secretary Julian Castro was looking for an angle to go after Biden.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCASTRO: My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\\n\\nBIDEN: They do not have to buy in.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBIDEN: They do not have to buy in.\\n\\nCASTRO: You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. You said they would have to buy in.\\n\\nBIDEN: Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid...\\n\\nCASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\\n\\n(OOHING)\\n\\nCASTRO: Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\\n\\nRASCOE: Yeah, that reaction kind of said it all when he said that - did you just forget what you just said? And everybody's like, oh.\\n\\nDETROW: I think it's notable that nobody else followed Castro's lead, and Castro dropped that after that first back-and-forth and did not return to that line of attack.\\n\\nELVING: And he may not - we don't know - but he may not have meant it to be quite so blunt a reference to his age.\\n\\nDETROW: I think so, Ron.\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter).\\n\\nELVING: But the audience reaction made it very clear how everyone took it. So whether he meant it or not, that's the way it goes into the book.\\n\\nDETROW: I'll say this. I'll say Julian Castro has shown that he thinks through most of the things he does. He is pretty upfront about the political calculation that he puts into a lot of his actions.\\n\\nKEITH: I have a debate question, which is, in the first debate, Kamala Harris came in with her planned fight that she was going to have with Joe Biden. And Julian Castro clearly came into this debate out to have a fight with Joe Biden. I know that initially, the thought was that Kamala Harris really excelled in that fight with Biden. But in the end, I don't know. Does it actually work? You know, since then, I've talked to a lot of voters who were like, you know, I thought she was really mean to Joe.\\n\\nELVING: It did not work in the long run because while she got a big spike and a lot of people noticed her - and she sold that attack on him on bussing very well, and it was a real vulnerability, too, a long standing vulnerability of Joe Biden's. So she was really hitting a soft point. This thing tonight seemed a little bit more like a cheap shot, especially given the audience reaction. And so when Buttigieg jumped in to be critical of it and to, in a sense, implicitly defend Biden...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\\n\\nELVING: ...That sort of cauterized the moment, and they went on. They just moved on. And there did not seem to be an opportunity for him to benefit as there was for Harris in that first debate.\\n\\nKEITH: All right. We are going to move on and take a break. And when we come back, Beto O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, foreign policy and a few things we couldn't let go.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nKEITH: And we're back. And I want to start with Kamala Harris. She is the senator from California, and it seemed like she came into tonight's debate with one mission in mind, and that was to entice President Trump to tweet at her.\\n\\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\\n\\nKEITH: And maybe I'm wrong about this.\\n\\nELVING: Tweet me.\\n\\nRASCOE: She may succeed...\\n\\nELVING: Tweet me.\\n\\nRASCOE: ...That little man behind the curtain.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nHARRIS: The bottom line is this - Donald Trump in office on trade policy - you know, he reminds me that that guy in The Wizard Of Oz. You know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKEITH: And that was not her only time going after President Trump in the debate. It seemed like every single time she spoke, she was, like, let me turn this around.\\n\\nDETROW: Well, she began the debate with - her opening statement was, she said, I'm going to directly address President Trump, who I know is watching. And actually, he was giving a speech to Republicans in Baltimore.\\n\\nKEITH: Like, an hour-long speech.\\n\\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\\n\\nDETROW: I think...\\n\\nRASCOE: He'll TiVo it.\\n\\nKEITH: He said he would.\\n\\nDETROW: He is...\\n\\nRASCOE: Yeah.\\n\\nDETROW: ...A big TiVo-er (ph) for sure.\\n\\nRASCOE: It seemed like the strategy for this one was, yes, to get Trump to maybe notice her (laughter) and strike out at her or - on Twitter, but also trying to make this distinction that, look - Trump is the person we need to go after. And that's always been the question during these campaigns - like, how much do you want to make it about Trump?\\n\\nAnd so what she seemed to be trying to say is, we want to beat Trump. None of this matters - and I think she did say none of this matters if we don't beat him. And so I'm the person to do that. That's what she was trying to do. Of course, people will debate whether it was successful.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. Yeah. I think she was almost trying to say, like, we can fight amongst ourselves, but really, we should just fight the other guy - maybe the one behind the curtain.\\n\\nELVING: Which can sometimes be a great unifying strategy. It just didn't seem to catch tonight.\\n\\nKEITH: I want to turn to Beto O'Rourke and, more broadly, the issue that he has really taken up since the mass shooting in El Paso and Dayton and later in West Texas. He has made that the centerpiece of his campaign - trying to get gun legislation and making other changes. And in particular, he has gone out farther than many other Democrats in the field, calling for not just a ban on new sales of assault-type-style weapons, AR-15s, but a mandatory buyback - basically, taking the guns away.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBETO O'ROURKE: And in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15. And that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes - we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nDETROW: And that's the closest he came to cursing, we should say.\\n\\nKEITH: Yes. That was his mild cursing.\\n\\nRASCOE: This issue of the buybacks is - it's a tricky issue. And it may be why O'Rourke is so out on this, and other people may not be joining him - is because NPR had a poll - the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that came out earlier this week. And what they found was that support for actual buybacks is really mixed.\\n\\nSo overall, only 45% of people are supporting buybacks. And then - now, Democrats do support it more. You have 70% supporting it, Republicans 23%. But those independents who you're probably going to want to win - they - only 40% support these buybacks. So this is something where there isn't - outside of the Democratic base, there doesn't seem to be widespread support.\\n\\nELVING: Even among House Democrats - they don't have a clear consensus on anything beyond background checks. They're not really ready to go for an assault weapons ban, even among House Democrats looking for what they can get through the Judiciary Committee and through the House floor. They know they won't get anything through the Senate, of course, but just deciding what their unified position is in the House.\\n\\nSo it's very hard to imagine that this is going to be the cutting edge of the Democratic platform next year, But maybe it will. And certainly, incidents of the kind that have been suffered in El Paso, so many other cities - Midland, Odessa in Texas just in the last few weeks - have changed the conversation.\\n\\nKEITH: But when President Trump talks about, oh, those scary Democrats, they want to take your guns away, what he's talking about is Beto O'Rourke and people who would support a mandatory gun buyback.\\n\\nELVING: And that is going to be a popular view among not only Trump Republicans but also many independents.\\n\\nKEITH: Foreign policy is something that we said would come up in this debate And, lo and behold, it did come up in this debate. One of our predictions was correct (laughter).\\n\\nELVING: You know, every once in a while.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nELVING: Well, you know, we just saw the national security adviser fired, and we have just had this extraordinary, phenomenal spectacle of watching the president say, you know, I had a secret meeting coming up at Camp David to settle that whole Afghanistan war thing, and now I called it off because one of our soldiers got killed. Clearly they were going to have to get around to talking a little bit about foreign policy tonight. And they did talk about Afghanistan. They did talk, of course, about Iraq.\\n\\nIt was another occasion for Joe Biden to have to do a dance about how he voted for the Iraq war, and he called in an authorization for the use of military force, and didn't think it was really going to lead to a war. And we've heard it all before. But it was another moment for Biden to be vulnerable.\\n\\nDETROW: He was specifically talking tonight about something that he told the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. He had said he had voted for - to authorize the war in order to give President Bush leverage but that he had begun to oppose the war the moment that bombs started dropping, the moment that it began. Well, that just wasn't true. Biden didn't really fully oppose the war until about two years later, and he addressed that discrepancy tonight.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBIDEN: I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on. Well, what I always argued against in the beginning once he started to put the troops in was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way.\\n\\nKEITH: So that was Iraq. But Afghanistan was a larger focus of the conversation in the debate and is more present in a lot of people's minds because of what Ron talked about with the president potentially negotiating with the Taliban at Camp David and then scrapping it. Ayesha, they were asked, what would you do? What did they say?\\n\\nRASCOE: Well, many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the U.S. to get out of Afghanistan - that the war has gone on too long. In particular, Warren said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nWARREN: We need to bring our troops home, and then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.\\n\\nELVING: And several of the candidates said that as long as we could have the suppression of any terrorist threat to the United States originating in Afghanistan - here we are just a few days after the 18th anniversary of 9/11, which was planned and largely put together in Afghanistan - as long as we could be assured that that couldn't happen again, and we had the suppression of that kind of terrorist activity, we didn't really need to tell Afghanistan what kind of government it was going to have anymore, and we could leave that part of the world.\\n\\nThat seemed to be the basic thrust. Pete Buttigieg, who has actually served in Afghanistan, wanted to make that point and also wanted to say that we shouldn't be looking at any of our troops and telling them that we're not going to stand with them and that we are not going to be committed to the things we send them into the field to die for.\\n\\nKEITH: So, as with every debate, there were a lot of things covered. There were also a lot of things that weren't covered. And there are a few stray moments that I feel like we should probably talk about. One of those was Vice President Biden, in a very long answer about schools and segregation - he started talking about turntables.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBIDEN: Play the radio. Make sure the television's - the - excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school - a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\\n\\nKEITH: So many words - there were so many words.\\n\\nDETROW: It is a very real point about making sure your kids hear a lot of words, though.\\n\\nELVING: That is a good point.\\n\\nKEITH: It's...\\n\\nRASCOE: It is true.\\n\\nKEITH: ...Very important.\\n\\nRASCOE: Although the study that kind of came from - there are, like, questions about that because it said that, like, poor people or people on welfare - their kids hear, like, millions less words, and there's a question about whether that's actually the case. But yes, you should talk to your kids. It's important.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah. And I narrate everything for my poor children. They - like, their whole lives are, like, one NPR POLITICS PODCAST. And now we're eating bananas - oh, bananas.\\n\\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\\n\\nELVING: Understood. Understood. My daughter would...\\n\\nRASCOE: But the thing...\\n\\nELVING: ...Make the same complaint.\\n\\nRASCOE: ...With the record player, right?\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah.\\n\\nRASCOE: Like, that was...\\n\\nELVING: Yeah.\\n\\nRASCOE: ...The issue with what he said.\\n\\nELVING: The record player is what's going to stick.\\n\\nRASCOE: Play the record player for your kids.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah.\\n\\nDETROW: I texted our colleague Kelsey Snell making fun of this. And as soon as I hit send, I regretted it. And I thought, oh, Kelsey's actually someone who probably would have a record player. And five minutes later, she was, like, hey, I have a record player.\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah, because...\\n\\nDETROW: So there you go.\\n\\nKEITH: ...Record players are cool again. They're back.\\n\\nELVING: Vinyl is cool.\\n\\nKEITH: Scott, what can you not let go of?\\n\\nDETROW: You know, I'll admit - and I know our bosses are listening, so I will say that this does not take up too much mental energy on debate nights - but on debate nights, I've got a side passion project.\\n\\nKEITH: (Laughter).\\n\\nDETROW: And that is #debatedogs. This actually started in 2016 during the general election debate. Sam Sanders and I - just at one point, when they were really grim and really toxic, we were just, like, hey, everybody. Just tweet a picture - if your dog is watching the debate, tweet us a picture of your dog watching the debate. And people did that.\\n\\nAnd then when the first debate started up again this year, a couple listeners remembered it, and they said, hey, are you still doing debate dogs? And I was, like, you're right. We are still doing debate dogs. So every debate night, I encourage people to tweet pictures of their dog watching the debate on TV with the hashtag #debatedogs. I retweet as many as I can when I am, of course, not working very hard focusing on my day job. But...\\n\\nKEITH: Or your late-night job.\\n\\nDETROW: Or my late-night job.\\n\\nRASCOE: Yes.\\n\\nDETROW: But a lot of great pictures came in. If you have a dog, and you watch the debate with them, please join #debatedogs next time around. And I will just say I lost my pooch earlier this year.\\n\\nKEITH: Aw.\\n\\nDETROW: And that makes these pictures that come in on my Twitter feed - because I certainly have an entire column dedicated to this - makes me really happy to see all the dogs, especially beagles, watching the debates. And it was very telling that about halfway through this three-hour debate, most of the dogs in the pictures were fast asleep.\\n\\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\\n\\nKEITH: Aw.\\n\\nELVING: Aw.\\n\\nKEITH: That is a wrap for today. We will be back as soon as there is political news that you need to know about. Until then, join us on Facebook and our brand-new Facebook group. It's a place for you to connect with us and other podcast listeners. Just head to n.pr/politicsgroup and request to join. Scott, you had better post some dog pictures in there.\\n\\nDETROW: Yes, I will.\\n\\nKEITH: OK, good.\\n\\nI'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\\n\\nDETROW: I'm Scott Detrow. I cover the campaign.\\n\\nRASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I also cover the White House.\\n\\nELVING: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent.\\n\\nKEITH: And thank you for listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, FLAWLESS)\\n\\nBEYONCE: (Singing) Ladies, tell them, I woke up like this.

{"original": "As Trump Declares National Emergency To Fund Border Wall, Democrats Promise A Fight\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 6:15 p.m. ET\\n\\nCalling it a great thing to do, President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in order to help finance a long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. It's a highly unusual move from an unconventional president.\\n\\nIn circuitous remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump said he was declaring an emergency because of an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.\\n\\nThe move came a day after Congress approved a spending bill giving Trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, far short of the $5.7 billion he had called for. Trump signed the bill Friday afternoon, averting another government shutdown until at least October. Invoking emergency powers frees up additional funding.\\n\\nLegal challenges and pushback even from some within his own party await Trump in the next phase of the ongoing national political battle over border security and immigration policy — cementing the issues at the forefront of his bid for a second term.\\n\\nThe House Judiciary Committee announced Friday evening that it is launching an immediate investigation into Trump's decision to declare the national emergency. The committee is requesting that those involved in the declaration, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, testify on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nChairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and six other House Democrats who chair subcommittees of the judiciary panel, signed the letter to the president, writing that we believe your declaration of an emergency shows a reckless disregard for the separation of powers and your own responsibilities under our constitutional system.\\n\\nOpponents of the declaration say that Trump's claim of a crisis at the border is overblown and that the move is unnecessary. Illegal border crossings in the most recent fiscal year (ending in September 2018) were actually lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and much lower than at their peak around 2000, as NPR has previously fact-checked. Many of the most recent arrivals are Central American migrants seeking asylum, citing a fear of violence or persecution back home.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a statement sharply critical of the president's action. The statement said, in part:\\n\\nThe President's unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation. ... The President's actions clearly violate the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\\n\\nWhite House officials say Trump's executive action, including the emergency declaration, will free up about $8 billion for border wall construction. That includes the $1.375 billion in the funding bill passed by Congress on Thursday.\\n\\nThe balance of the funds include:\\n\\n$600 million from the Treasury drug forfeiture fund.\\n\\nSome $2.5 billion from counter drug activities with the Department of Defense and some reprogramming from other Pentagon accounts.\\n\\nSome $3.6 billion in military construction funds.\\n\\nNo disaster money will be used.\\n\\nRep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee, called the reallocation of funds utterly disrespectful of U.S. national security and the needs of our men and women in uniform, and it further undermines his credibility in requesting the upcoming defense budget.\\n\\nWhite House officials say the $8 billion should allow Trump to build as much wall as he wanted to — 234 miles of barrier — had Congress authorized the $5.7 billion he asked for. Officials say plans are to construct a metal bollard barrier, not a concrete wall, at locations to be determined by Customs and Border Protection.\\n\\nTrump said Friday that he expects such legal challenges and predicted they would eventually reach the Supreme Court, where, he said, We'll win, I think.\\n\\nI didn't need to do this, Trump said in response to a reporter's question about the emergency declaration. I just want to get it done faster, that's all.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had previously cautioned Trump against declaring a national emergency, said Thursday he was on board with the president's move. However, others within the GOP have pushed back.\\n\\nCentrist Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for re-election in 2020, called Trump's planned move a mistake in a statement Thursday. Collins also argued that the National Emergencies Act was only intended to apply to major natural disasters or catastrophic events, such as the attacks on our country.\\n\\nSuch a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process; it's just not good policy. It also sets a bad precedent for future presidents — both Democratic and Republican — who might seek to use this same maneuver to circumvent Congress to advance their policy goals. It is also of dubious constitutionality, and it will almost certainly be challenged in the courts, Collins said.\\n\\nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, whose districts covers about 800 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, said Friday on The View that the declaration was unnecessary and expressed concerns about the land seizures that would have to take place in order to build the wall.\\n\\nWhat we should be talking about is the strategy on how to defend our border, not one specific tool, which is the wall, Hurd said.\\n\\nBut to Trump, declaring a national emergency likely seems to be the only way he can claim victory after weeks of back-and-forth over funding for border security that included a record 35-day partial government shutdown.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAnother shutdown would have been risky, and there wasn't much appetite for going that route again among congressional Republicans.\\n\\nBut there's little support among the public for Trump's approach either. A CNN poll earlier this month showed Americans oppose — by more than 2 to 1 — Trump using a national emergency declaration to build a border wall.\\n\\nThat seems to be one of the messages Democratic leaders will home in on during what is likely to be a new phase in the standoff over border security.\\n\\nPolitics California Attorney General Discusses Legal Challenges To National Emergency California Attorney General Discusses Legal Challenges To National Emergency Listen · 4:56 4:56\\n\\nIn the Democrats' Spanish-language response to Trump's State of the Union earlier this month, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he would sue the administration if Trump declared a national emergency to find funds for a border wall.\\n\\nOn Friday, appearing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Becerra said a lawsuit would likely be coming soon. This is not 9/11. This is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, Becerra said, citing past presidential emergency declarations.

{"original": "A Purple Heart Warrior Takes Aim At Military Inequality In 'Shoot Like A Girl'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Penguin Group USA Penguin Group USA\\n\\nIn 2009, Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar was shot down by the Taliban in Afghanistan while co-piloting an Air National Guard medevac helicopter. Though she was wounded in her rifle arm, Hegar managed to return fire while hanging onto a moving helicopter, which saved the lives of her crew and her patients.\\n\\nAt the time, the Department of Defense allowed female soldiers to participate in air combat, but forbade women from ground combat positions. Hegar tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the rule was often circumvented, which meant that women who served on the ground did not receive credit for combat duty.\\n\\nIn 2012, Hegar became a plaintiff in an ACLU suit against the Defense Department, arguing that excluding women from combat was unconstitutional. She says that participating in the lawsuit wasn't about women's rights, it was about military effectiveness. That same year, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff lifted the ban on women serving in combat. But Hegar doesn't count the case as closed — she says, The lawsuit remains open as a way for us to monitor integration, especially through a changing administration, and make sure that we don't take any steps backwards.\\n\\nHegar notes that when it comes to combat, physical strength is not necessarily the most important factor on the battlefield. It's who is the best with their weapons, who is the best tactical thinker, ... who holds their composure when the bullets fly, she says. I've seen 200-lb. men curl up in the fetal position and call for their moms before, just by the nature of my business.\\n\\nHegar received the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross with a Valor Device for her service in Afghanistan. Her new memoir is called Shoot like a Girl.\\n\\nMaj. Hegar: A Woman Who Has Already Seen Combat Maj. Hegar: A Woman Who Has Already Seen Combat Listen · 4:21 4:21\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nOn the problems that cropped up when women were barred from ground combat\\n\\nI knew that I wanted to apply for a job in the Air Force, that I couldn't because it was a direct-combat, ground-combat role. But it didn't really sink in to me because it impacts the Air Force like 1 percent, whereas the other branches — the Marines, the Army — it really, really impacts them. ...\\n\\nI was given credit for being in combat, because air combat [was] allowed. I have the Air Force combat action medal. I have a couple of medals that denote that I was in combat, and it says that on my records, [but] I wouldn't have gotten credit for being in combat on the ground if I were a ground troop.\\n\\nShoot Like a Girl One Woman's Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front by Mary Jennings Hegar Hardcover, 292 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\\n\\nSo the reason that that's important is, obviously, for things like promotion. But if you think about becoming a joint chief of staff or something like that, you can't have that job unless you have led troops in combat, unless you've been in combat, held combat roles and those types of things. Even though the women that I'm serving with today have been [in combat], they [wouldn't] get credit for that in their record. So they could never rise to the level of a joint chief of staff.\\n\\nOn the unofficial ways in which women served in combat in the past\\n\\nThe Marine Female Engagement Team is a great example of that, where they go out and they're the ones who talk to the female locals and have to pat them down if they're going through a checkpoint. That's not something that the culture would allow our male soldiers to do, so there's a need for women in those roles. But because of the policy, they couldn't be assigned to [combat] units, which caused all sorts of problems. ...\\n\\nThey would be what we call attached to the unit. They wouldn't get to train with the unit, they wouldn't go home and stay at the same base with the unit, they wouldn't get to know them, they wouldn't get a chance to bond with them. The unit cohesion wouldn't get a chance to form.\\n\\nOn some of the arguments against women serving in combat\\n\\nThey range from concerns that are very legitimate and need to be carefully considered to concerns that are absolutely ridiculous. I think the No. 1 thing that pops up in people's mind is the physical strength issue and whether or not women are physically strong enough to be in combat, which I answer with a couple things: First of all, we've already disproven that that's an issue because there are women serving successfully in combat. Most combat is not a hand-to-hand knife battle that the person who can do the most push-ups is going to end up winning. That's just not the face of modern warfare right now. ...\\n\\nI [was] in medevac, so I [saw] people having their hardest day. I've seen firsthand that the warrior spirit is not directly proportional to how many pull-ups you can do. ... In my opinion, you keep the standards very high and you maintain one standard. There shouldn't be two standards for women and men, there should be a standard for this job: To do this job, you should have to do these things. And those requirements should be job-specific and not arbitrarily high in order to specifically keep women out.\\n\\nOn what motivated her to join the lawsuit against the Defense Department\\n\\nSome people who haven't really looked into what happened with the suit, they like to assume that I have taken some kind of anti-military or anti-establishment stance, and it couldn't be further from the truth. ...\\n\\n... it was never about fighting the military — it was about this is the right thing to do for the military.\\n\\nWe were trying to double the pool of candidates that could apply for any position. So any time you increase the number of candidates that can apply, you're obviously going to get a better product out of that. So it was never about fighting the military — it was about this is the right thing to do for the military. A lot of people agreed with me, and we were trying to offer the secretary of defense — then Leon Panetta at the time — as much ammunition as possible to enable him to lift the policy.\\n\\nOn being a warrior and a mother\\n\\nI think of myself as a bit of a mother bear, and if anybody poses a threat to my kids they'll see both my mother's heart and my warrior spirit. I think that they're compatible. Throughout history, there's examples of women who have been mothers and gone on to lead in combat — Queen Boudicca is one that I can think of. ... So I believe that being a mother and a warrior are absolutely compatible. In fact, I think the things about me that make me a good warrior are the things that make me a good mother: My steadfast commitment to integrity and excellence and putting others before myself and being protective. I tap on those same things as a mother."}

Seen Through A Doctor With The Disease\\n\\nThe city of Birmingham, Ala., is now under a shelter-in-place order, as hospitals there are being inundated with COVID-19 patients. A local cardiologist who is now ill with the disease speaks.\\n\\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\\n\\nAlabama is the latest state to order citizens to stay at home amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey was under pressure to be more aggressive, as neighboring states and Alabama's largest city had already imposed shelter-in-place orders. Birmingham has seen an escalation in COVID-19 cases. One doctor in that city is combatting the disease personally and professionally and hoping for the best. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports.\\n\\nDEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: After working for weeks to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Mustafa Ahmed is now fighting his own case of COVID-19.\\n\\nMUSTAFA AHMED: For me, it was like I was being hit by a train.\\n\\nELLIOTT: Ahmed is an interventional cardiologist at UAB, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a major medical hub for the state. His symptoms came on fast - intense headache, fever, muscle aches, fatigue.\\n\\nAHMED: It's a scary thing when you get this because you're seeing colleagues and health care workers around the world really struck down with it.\\n\\nELLIOTT: Ahmed is 38 years old and had been in good health. Now he's in single-room isolation at home. He's been using technology to connect remotely with family around the world and his colleagues at UAB. Because of a lack of widespread testing, he says there's no way to pinpoint how he became infected.\\n\\nAHMED: Is it from just walking around? Is it before you get to work? Is it on the way into work? Is it the people you pass the week before that don't want to social distance or feel the need ignore that? And so you don't know.\\n\\nELLIOTT: Those are universal questions, Ahmed says, that could only be answered with universal testing, something that's not possible right now. But he says, the testing situation at UAB has improved vastly from weeks ago, when tests was scarce and results took days to process. Now, he says, results are back in hours, and there's a promise of an even more rapid test.\\n\\nAHMED: This is a weekly moving target. Where we are right now this minute is a long, long - what's the best way to say this? - is a hell of a lot better than where we were this time last week. And this time last week, we were in a much better situation than we were in the week before that.\\n\\nELLIOTT: Regardless of the testing capacity, Ahmed says there's no question that there's community spread happening in Birmingham right now. UAB and other local hospitals started getting their first wave of severe cases last week.\\n\\nAHMED: It's just starting.

{"original": "Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barbara Rodriguez/AP Barbara Rodriguez/AP\\n\\nWith a newly configured U.S. Supreme Court, the stakes are high for abortion-rights battles at the state level. Abortion-rights advocates and opponents are preparing for a busy year — from a tug-of-war over Roe v. Wade to smaller efforts that could expand or restrict access to abortion.\\n\\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is known for his conservative record on issues including reproductive rights. And with his confirmation, many abortion-rights opponents see new opportunities to restrict the procedure at the state level.\\n\\nThe pro-life movement has been talking about more pro-life-friendly courts for years, and we see Kavanaugh really tilting that balance, says Jamieson Gordon with Ohio Right to Life.\\n\\nActivists in Ohio just pushed through a law banning a common second-trimester abortion procedure called dilation and evacuation. Gordon says her group is feeling optimistic and is working to pass more restrictions in the new year.\\n\\nIt really has been encouraging for us knowing that if our bill ... got picked up to go to the court, that we would have a more favorable court, she says. So I do think that we've seen the tide turn.\\n\\nA watershed moment\\n\\nAbortion-rights advocates also are preparing for a wave of bills to be introduced in statehouses across the country, says Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\\n\\nWe think this will be a watershed moment in terms of the number [of bills] that are filed, and then potentially the number that will actually be enacted in various states, Smith says.\\n\\nShe says advocates are working to protect abortion rights, repeal existing restrictions and fight new efforts to limit access to the procedure.\\n\\nI think the specter of the Supreme Court will be behind both the proactive bills — in terms of shoring up the right and access [to abortion] at the state level — and on the other side, I think states that are hostile to reproductive rights are going to be jockeying to be the state that sends a law to the Supreme Court, Smith says.\\n\\nTug-of-war over Roe v. Wade\\n\\nMany abortion-rights opponents say they're hoping to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\\n\\nStates want their bill to be the one to go to the Supreme Court. They want to be the one, says Sue Liebel, state director for the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List.\\n\\nPossible test cases for Roe already are working their way through the courts — including an Iowa law banning abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and one in Mississippi prohibiting the procedure after 15 weeks.\\n\\nLiebel says anti-abortion-rights activists want to pass similar bills in as many states as possible.\\n\\nSo I think they're hopeful; they're energized and rarin' to go, Liebel says.\\n\\nIf Roe were weakened or overturned, more power for regulating abortion would fall to the states. Several anti-abortion-rights groups are pushing to increase the number of states banning abortion after 20 weeks or earlier.\\n\\nMeanwhile, lawmakers supportive of abortion rights in several states are sponsoring bills to guarantee the right to abortion in state law, in places including Massachusetts, Virginia and even Texas, according to Smith, with the Center for Reproductive Rights.\\n\\nIt's unlikely that [Texas] bill will pass, Smith says. But I think more and more state advocates are bringing up this bill — either as a messaging vehicle, or to actually get it enacted.\\n\\nBig steps, and small ones\\n\\nNARAL Pro-Choice America is promoting those bills. But Deputy Policy Director Leslie McGorman says it is also working on incremental efforts to improve abortion access, including legislation allowing a broader range of medical providers — such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants — to provide abortions in more states.\\n\\nWe know that as long as abortion is sort of a one-off procedure, or care that's delivered in a standalone clinic and people sort of don't know what it is, that it's gonna be this part of health care that's sort of viewed that way, that's viewed as sort of marginal, McGorman says.\\n\\nAbortion-rights opponents also are continuing to pursue their own incremental strategy.\\n\\nAmericans United for Life has close to 60 model bills aimed at restricting abortion. Among them is the Abortion Reporting Act, which requires medical providers to submit detailed reports to health officials about abortion-related complications.\\n\\nThis is really designed to make sure that women are informed about those abortion providers that are especially dangerous, says the group's president, Catherine Glenn Foster.\\n\\nAbortion-rights advocates say the requirements are intrusive and vaguely defined. Planned Parenthood sued last summer to block a similar law in Idaho.\\n\\nThere's also a big push to defund abortion facilities, to stop them from getting Title X funding, says Ingrid Duran, of the National Right to Life Committee.\\n\\nIt's already illegal for federal funds to pay for abortions in most cases, but anti-abortion activists want to ban organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which offer abortions, from receiving any public money for reproductive health services. The Trump administration has proposed blocking such groups from getting funds through Title X, the federal family planning program for low-income people; Duran says similar efforts are underway in many states."}

In a statement, the office said it will look into how USC handled reports and complaints of sexual harassment during pelvic exams as early as 1990 that were not fully investigated by the University until spring 2016 and that the University did not disclose to OCR during an earlier investigation.\\n\\nTyndall is the former university gynecologist accused of sexually inappropriate behavior with students during their medical exams. The Los Angeles Police Department is now investigating 52 complaints about Tyndall, which range from unnecessary touching in the course of pelvic exams to inappropriate sexual comments.\\n\\nUSC faculty, alumni, staff, students, and even the Chinese consulate have been increasingly demanding accountability from the university in how it handled the case of Tyndall.\\n\\nOn Saturday, about two dozen University of Southern California students and alumni marched from the school's student health center to the university's main quad chanting USC transparency. They called for help for Tyndall's alleged victims and a full accounting of USC's possible role in covering up his actions.\\n\\nWe are at a breaking point, alumna Viva Symanski, who alleges Tyndall sexually abused her, said at a podium. Things have to change. USC must change.\\n\\nLast summer, in a confidential deal, Tyndall was allowed to resign from the university with a financial payout. USC didn't report the allegations against Tyndall to state medical authorities, nor did it inform his patients. His alleged sexual misconduct is thought to have gone on for years — he worked at the school for nearly three decades before his suspension in 2016.\\n\\nI think the university, as much as I love it, was extremely complicit in this, said Ariel Sobel, a USC graduate who helped organize the march. She's the co-founder of Justice for Trojans, a group trying to help women who say they were abused by Tyndall.\\n\\nSome are asking for legal support, said Sobel. Some are looking for other survivors to talk to. Some are looking for therapy. Some just want to have someone talk on the phone with them and listen to them.\\n\\nChinese students at USC are particularly concerned about the allegations against Tyndall.\\n\\nIn recent years, the university has aggressively recruited students from China. About 5,500 are currently enrolled at the school.\\n\\nWe Chinese students we come from a relatively conservative culture, said Andy Zhang, a sophomore and member of the Chinese Student Association.\\n\\nZhang explained students from China who were Tyndall's patients might be reluctant to report sexual misconduct because of language issues and cultural differences.\\n\\nIt could be more difficult for our students, when they run into uncomfortable situations, it can be difficult for them to speak out, said Zhang, who went on to say Chinese student groups are reaching out to possible victims to offer assistance.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles has demanded a full investigation by USC into Tyndall and possible abuse of Chinese nationals by him.\\n\\nPressure on the university is also coming from USC's faculty and staff. After 200 of them signed a letter demanding the resignation of school president Max Nikias, he stepped down last month.\\n\\nSo it's happened once and I think the issue now is to make sure that it doesn't happen again, said LaVonna Blair Lewis with USC's Sol Price School of Public Policy.\\n\\nWhat are we going to do to make sure that we're not having this same story being told with different names?\\n\\nEchoing others on campus, Blair Lewis says she believes in recent years the university has been too focused on fundraising and boosting its place in academic rankings instead of protecting students. She hopes priorities now change.\\n\\nAnd, again, what are we going to do to make sure that we're not having this same story being told with different names? said Blair Lewis.\\n\\nUSC didn't respond to a request for an interview. Instead it sent a statement about measures it is taking to protect students. These measures include educating students seeking gynecological services about their rights and how to report complaints.\\n\\nThe school has also established a hotline and started an investigation into Tyndall.\\n\\nThe LAPD has launched its own investigation into dozens of cases involving Tyndall. The university also faces a growing number of lawsuits, including from celebrity attorney Gloria Allred. This week, she said, she'll add more than 20 additional plaintiffs to a suit she's filed against USC.\\n\\nIt should not have taken decades for these women to finally be protected, said Allred."}

After a tense standoff, in which police fired tear gas and attempted to beat back the migrants with batons, the surging crowd broke through a phalanx of soldiers.\\n\\nGuillermo Díaz, Guatemala's top immigration official, says that since Friday 7,000-8,000 Hondurans have crossed in to Guatemala in an irregular manner.\\n\\nWe are very concerned about this situation, Díaz says in a video on his department's Facebook page. These people who've formed this caravan or are forming into a caravan...is a very difficult situation to manage. Guatemala has set up checkpoints on main roads leading to and from the Honduran border. However, Díaz says many of the migrants have left the main roads and are now arriving in towns in the middle of the country. Officials are very worried, he adds, because another group of roughly the same size is on its way.\\n\\nWe hope this situation stops, he says. And this flow of migrants ends.\\n\\nMexican authorities praised the Guatemalan government's forceful response to the migrants. Mexico has beefed up security on its own southern border with Guatemala in anticipation of the caravan. Mexico also sent six buses south to help transport Hondurans back to their home country. The Mexican Secretary for Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling on Honduran officials to do more to stop the irregular flow of citizens through the region.\\n\\nBut migrants in the caravan say they have little choice but to march north.\\n\\nWe don't want to live in Honduras anymore, Ana Murillo told the French news agency Agence France-Presse. Standing with a group of migrants beside a busy road in southern Guatemala, she says Hondurans have been badly affected by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which slammed into the country in November. Honduras also suffers from incredibly high rates of violent crime and the pandemic has crippled the economy.\\n\\nThere isn't any work. There are no opportunities, she says. A light blue cloth face mask hangs from her chin, several bags and children are at her feet. We are leaving because we don't want to suffer further.\\n\\ntoggle caption Sandra Sebastian/AP\\n\\nAnother migrant, Miguel Angel, tells AFP he's heading north now because he believes U.S. immigration policy will change once Joe Biden takes office as president.\\n\\nI have hope and faith in God, and in the good person that the United States has chosen, he says.\\n\\nBiden is a good person and isn't the same as the administration that's just ended.\\n\\nBut his chances of making it to the U.S./Mexico border are far less than they were a few years ago. In October 2020, another caravan of Hondurans dispersed before it got across Guatemala, and Guatemalan officials said they sent more than 3,000 Hondurans home from that group.\\n\\nIn 2019, Mexico deployed National Guard troops to its southern border to deter Central Americans from trying to cross.\\n\\nAriel Ruiz Soto, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., says he doesn't think it's likely that many of the Hondurans in this current caravan will make it all the way to the U.S. frontier. I suspect that if this caravan actually made it to the Guatemalan/Mexico border that there would be even the heavier presence of (Mexican) National Guard to try to detain the migrants, he says. We saw this again in October. That caravan really stopped in Guatemala at that time. So I don't foresee them getting to the U.S./Mexico border in large numbers.\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, nationals from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua were able to travel freely across each other's borders. Officials now are requiring a negative coronavirus test to cross. Some migrant advocates say this requirement is being used to block some refugees from seeking asylum abroad.\\n\\ntoggle caption Johan Ordonez/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nTom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, agrees with Ruiz that this current caravan is unlikely to turn into a crisis for the Biden administration during its first few weeks in office.\\n\\nIn 2018, in advance of the election there were a lot people holding their breath about caravans that dissipated long before they ever came close to the United States border, Jawetz says.\\n\\nDespite that, he says the incoming Biden team can't ignore immigration and the immigration policies of the outgoing Trump administration for long.\\n\\nA number of the steps that were taken by the last administration to try to deter people from coming to the country where not only illegal, but unconscionable, he says.\\n\\nHumans have been migrating since prehistoric times. Migration isn't going to stop. Even if this caravan doesn't make it to the U.S. border, other migrants are already there waiting. Some other potential migrants may view the change in administration in Washington as an opportunity to try to enter.\\n\\nEven if that were the case, to what ends would you go in order to head that off? Jawetz asks. Would you have them violate U.S. law, international law, and prevent people from requesting asylum at the border? Would you have them take their children away in order to send fear into the hearts of families throughout the region?\\n\\nSoon after he takes office, Biden is going to have to face the big questions around what Jawetz calls the U.S.'s broken immigration system."}
{"original": "Breakdown Of Talks In Myanmar Prompts High-Profile Negotiator's Resignation\\n\\nFormer New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson will no longer serve on the board tasked with implementing changes in Myanmar's restive Rakhine State.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as Richardson was in Myanmar, also known as Burma, this week as a member of the Advisory Board on Rakhine State. He was meeting with government officials about two Reuters journalists who face up to 14 years in prison for allegedly violating the country's colonial-era Officials Secrets Acts.\\n\\nIn initial meetings with members of the Advisory Board and Daw Aun San Suu Kyi, it has become clear that I cannot in good conscience serve in this role, said Richardson.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board on Rakhine State was set up to implement recommendations regarding the Rohingya, Myanmar's brutally persecuted minority group, that were made by an advisory commission in 2017 — a commission led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annon.\\n\\nOn Monday, Richardson met with Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to discuss both the detained journalists as well as the plan to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees who had fled the country last year following a military crackdown.\\n\\nBy Wednesday, Richardson had cut his trip short and announced his resignation.\\n\\nI was extremely upset at State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's reaction to my request that she address the situation of the two Reuters journalists both swiftly and fairly, Richardson said in a statement, using an honorific for Suu Kyi.\\n\\nRichardson describes Suu Kyi as being furious with his suggestion that the journalists' case be handed swiftly as a way to protect freedom of the press, and a scheduled meeting with the Minister of Home Affairs was abruptly canceled. In the statement he also notes being taken aback by the vigor with which the media, the United Nations, human rights groups, and in general the international community were disparaged in meeting with Suu Kyi and the Advisory Board.\\n\\nWhile it is important to recognize that the military still wield significant power and that they are primarily to blame for the recent exodus of refugees in the wake of ARSA [Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army] attacks, the absence of Daw Suu's moral leadership on this critical issue is of great concern, says Richardson.\\n\\nRichardson also says it appears the Board is likely to become a cheerleading squad for government policy rather than genuine change needed to assure peace and stability in Rakhine State.\\n\\nSince August, nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled across the border into Bangladesh from their homes in Rakhine State. This latest exodus of the Muslim minority group followed a brutal military campaign launched in response to an attack by a Rohingya militant group on Myanmar police. A plan hammered out between Bangladesh and Myanmar to repatriate the Rohingya who've fled since August was supposed to start this week, but has been delayed indefinitely."}

DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Hey, castaway Tom Hanks. I'll be your friend. I'm Bill-son (ph)...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nKURTIS: ...Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.\\n\\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\\n\\nThank you, Bill. Thanks, everybody.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Thank you all so much. 2018 is finally over, and you thought you had escaped scot-free. But just when you thought you were out, we're going to pull you back in.\\n\\nKURTIS: On today's show, our own highlights of the year gone by. Someday, you're going to look back on all of this and say, no way that happened. But we've got it on tape.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Here's some of the key news moments of 2018 as interpreted by Bill.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: Your first quote, Lynn (ph), is a trenchant observation about the current complex debate about immigration.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKURTIS: Why are we having all these people from [expletive]-hole countries come here?\\n\\nHELEN HONG: Wow.\\n\\nROY BLOUNT JR: You know, someday, he's going to have a library.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Lynn, who was that?\\n\\nLYNN DAFFRON: Donald Trump.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Donald Trump.\\n\\nHONG: Yikes.\\n\\nSAGAL: This week, we finally got Trump's equivalent of JFK's ask not what your country...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Can do for you moment. But it was more like, kids, ask not what the president just said.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Look. We can't really say the word that President Trump used to describe countries in Central America.\\n\\nADAM FELBER: But we can. Why don't we just pronounce it phonetically? Shi-thole (ph).\\n\\nSAGAL: Shi-thole, yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHONG: Yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: That's a good idea, actually.\\n\\nFELBER: Yeah, shi-thole.\\n\\nSAGAL: Shi-thole.\\n\\nFELBER: He said shi-thole.\\n\\nSAGAL: He also said - after disparaging the people from those countries, he said he preferred immigrants from Norway, possibly because he had just met the prime minister of Norway the day before, and it went really well. She seemed very white.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBLOUNT JR: Yeah.\\n\\nHONG: I know I'd be more offended if I was Norway at this point. I'd be like, oh, God, no.\\n\\nFELBER: Yeah. We're the country he endorsed.\\n\\nHONG: Ick.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Now, there's one thing that made us - well, I'll just say a little melancholy about this otherwise very interesting news - is that it happened the week after the true legend of NPR, the greatest voice we've ever had on our airwaves, Robert Siegel, retired. So he did not have a chance...\\n\\nHONG: Oh.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...To say that on the air.\\n\\nBLOUNT JR: Oh.\\n\\nFELBER: Oh.\\n\\nSAGAL: However, we are fixing that now.\\n\\nFELBER: Yes.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nSAGAL: So, ladies and gentlemen, here is Robert Siegel.\\n\\nROBERT SIEGEL: Why are we having all these people from [expletive]-hole countries come here?\\n\\nSAGAL: There you go.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nFELBER: You know what's amazing?\\n\\nSAGAL: What?\\n\\nFELBER: From him, it sounds almost like...\\n\\nHONG: I know.\\n\\nFELBER: ...It's a good question.\\n\\nSAGAL: I know.\\n\\nHONG: Seriously, I...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: You really - the way - I mean, you're so used to hearing...\\n\\nHONG: I mean...\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Him do interviews, you want to say, well, Robert, the reason is...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nKURTIS: I ate all the leftover lasagna in my fridge. I figured that if bleep was about to hit the fan, I'd better carb it up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: That was one of many people in Hawaii last Saturday talking about how they reacted to what distressing news?\\n\\nJORDAN: The nuclear warhead false alarm.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes, that they were all about to be killed in a nuclear holocaust...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...At around 8 in the morning. Yes, that's great.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Terrifying - but false alarm. At around 8 in the morning last Saturday, everybody in Hawaii got a text on their phone reading, ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Oh, that's fun. And it turns out that it was all a false alarm, of course. It was caused by a technician who picked the wrong item from a drop-down menu. This is true. Like, one choice said, send test message. The other said, drive an entire state into panicked terror.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: And he picked the wrong one because he was also playing HQ Trivia on his phone. You know how it is.\\n\\nPAULA POUNDSTONE: Carb it up. I've never heard that phrase before.\\n\\nSAGAL: Well...\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: Carb it up.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Extreme situations call for extreme solutions.\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: Yeah, got to carb it up.\\n\\nALONZO BODDEN: Did he plan to run?\\n\\nSAGAL: No. Well, what was interesting was Internet forum Reddit asked for people to say, you know, what they did during that terrifying 38 minutes before they got the news that it was a false alarm.\\n\\nMO ROCCA: Thirty-eight minutes - wow.\\n\\nSAGAL: Thirty-eight minutes people thought that they might die. Many people...\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: You know what I would do?\\n\\nSAGAL: What?\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: I would call Verizon.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: Because I think you could get through.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Because nobody else would be doing it.\\n\\nPOUNDSTONE: Right, exactly. There's not going to be, like, a long - you know, here, you are - you know, you are 56th in line waiting for...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: Joe, for your last quote, please listen to this list that was put out by Delta Airlines.\\n\\nKURTIS: Comfort turkeys, sugar gliders, snakes, spiders and more.\\n\\nSAGAL: That was part of their press release announcing a new policy from Delta in which they are banning what from their airplanes?\\n\\nJOE CHRISTIAN: Weird pets.\\n\\nSAGAL: Not weird pets so much as animals that are classified as what?\\n\\nCHRISTIAN: Oh, service animals.\\n\\nSAGAL: Exactly. They are doing something about all the fake...\\n\\nPETER GROSZ: Oh, my God.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Service animals.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: Finally - people have been complaining about this for a while. And yes, they say that people have, in fact, brought on board their planes all the animals that Bill just listed. Seriously, guys - comfort turkeys?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Comfort spiders - of course, that makes sense because if you get agitated, they have all those legs to stroke you to calm you down.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nFAITH SALIE: Have you ever - I fly a lot, and I've just seen dogs and cats. Have you guys ever seen any of these...\\n\\nBIM ADEWUNMI: Yes. I mean, I myself travel with a comfort boa constrictor.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSALIE: Sure.\\n\\nGROSZ: For about the last almost nine years, I've been traveling with an un-comfort child...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: ...Which has made traveling very difficult.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: Your last quote, Laura, is from the head of the food and beverage conglomerate PepsiCo. And she's talking about women.\\n\\nKURTIS: They don't like to crunch too loudly in public, and they don't lick their fingers generously.\\n\\nSAGAL: Those were the comments that got everybody excited this week about her company introducing what potentially great new product?\\n\\nLAURA: That would be Doritos for women.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes, Lady Doritos.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: Very well done.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh, it was so exciting. It was a beautiful dream. Indra Nooyi - she's the CEO of PepsiCo - She did a podcast in which she talked about female preferences in regard to snack food, like their product Doritos. and she said women don't want crumbs on their hands, and they don't want loud crunching. And, more than anything, they don't want chips that Dorito-splain (ph) to them.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So everybody was excited because everybody was, like, oh, my gosh. Pepsi's introducing Lady Doritos - Doritos for her. But it turns out not to be true. PepsiCo put out a statement. They said there are already Doritos for ladies. They're called Doritos.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAMY DICKINSON: So, Peter, here's one thing they could do.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\nDICKINSON: You know, Doritos are triangle-shaped.\\n\\nSAGAL: They are.\\n\\nDICKINSON: Those of you who, like me - I like to get the big bag and finish it in one sitting.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\nDICKINSON: What happens to the...\\n\\nFELBER: The Big Grab?\\n\\nDICKINSON: The big one.\\n\\nFELBER: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: The Big Grab.\\n\\nFELBER: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: What happens to the roof of your mouth...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...On those points - it really, really - they can actually...\\n\\nSAGAL: A little sharp.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...Embed in the roof of your mouth. If you're...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDICKINSON: If you're eating a lot of them...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...At once...\\n\\nFELBER: And you are.\\n\\nDICKINSON: And you are. So that is something I think they could work on.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\nDICKINSON: If it were more...\\n\\nSAGAL: More rounded.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...Stackable or...\\n\\nSAGAL: You know...\\n\\nFELBER: Or a mouthguard that came with it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDICKINSON: Great idea.\\n\\nSAGAL: I'm glad you outed yourself, if you will, as a Doritos fan, because one of the other things that she said about women who enjoy Doritos and snack foods is they - that, unlike men, they don't like to do the thing where you pick up the bag that's almost empty, and you shake all the little crumbs and debris.\\n\\nFELBER: Nobody has to do that.\\n\\nDICKINSON: How do you think I got this eye shadow color?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: Carolyn, here is your next quote.\\n\\nKURTIS: I started this when I was so young and inexperienced.\\n\\nSAGAL: That was one of the excuses offered by a guy whose company, it turns out, sold all our data without telling us. What's the company?\\n\\nCAROLYN STREETS: Facebook.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes...\\n\\nSTREETS: Facebook.\\n\\nSAGAL: Facebook, indeed.\\n\\nSTREETS: (Laughter).\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: It turns out Facebook is good for three things - posting baby pictures, humble bragging and subverting democracy.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So this company's called Cambridge Analytica. They ended up working on Donald Trump's campaign. They stole the personal data from 50 million Facebook users, and they did it by asking people to download a quiz app. People were thrilled to do it. And because of that, Trump is now president.\\n\\nRASHAWN SCOTT: Yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: There's a direct line between you needing to know if you're more of a Rachel or a Monica...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...And the fact we're on the brink of nuclear war.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDICKINSON: But what are they going to do? Like, what are they - they're going to find my Facebook memories about the quinoa I had last year? Like, what are they doing with your stuff?\\n\\nSAGAL: Well...\\n\\nSCOTT: You just got into quinoa last year?\\n\\nDICKINSON: Yeah, man.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSCOTT: You're missing out. There's so many grains.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Quinoa? We're into farro now.\\n\\nSCOTT: What?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So...\\n\\nADAM BURKE: This is precisely why Russia wants to destroy us.\\n\\nSAGAL: Exactly.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: And why we deserve it. So people are talking - the hashtag is delete your account because people are so angry about Facebook's betrayal that people are saying, well, I'm going to quit Facebook on principle. But if you do that, how can you tell your friends that you just quit Facebook on principle?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSCOTT: I know.\\n\\nDICKINSON: I know. So Zuckerberg apologized, basically...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...Right?\\n\\nSAGAL: He says, we're sorry. We didn't understand. We didn't handle it well. We assure you it's going to be better now.\\n\\nBURKE: You know who wouldn't have done this?\\n\\nSAGAL: Who?\\n\\nBURKE: Tom from Myspace.\\n\\nSAGAL: Exactly.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSCOTT: You know, man?\\n\\nSAGAL: It's true, man.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: Here, Josh, is your last quote. It's from new age musician Yanni.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKURTIS: I may be biased, but all I hear is Yanny.\\n\\nSAGAL: He was, of course, weighing in on what great debate that tore our nation asunder this week?\\n\\nJOSH SMITH: It was, like, Yanny or Bruno? No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: I'll give it to you. It was Yanny or Laurel.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: Laurel or Yanny. You remember years ago, the Internet was consumed by the great gold dress versus blue dress debate. But that was back in a more innocent time when we had no real problems.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Now that the world is on fire, we've moved on to more important things...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Whether a computerized voice is saying Laurel or Yanny, especially when it's obviously saying Laurel. What is wrong with you?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTARA CLANCY: Oh, yes. Oh...\\n\\nROXANNE ROBERTS: What'd you get?\\n\\nTOM BODETT: Laurel.\\n\\nROBERTS: Laurel. Of course, it was Laurel.\\n\\nCLANCY: It's Yanny. Oh, my goodness.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCLANCY: I'm surrounded - people, America, it's Yanny.\\n\\nROBERTS: It's Laurel.\\n\\nBODETT: It's a high pitch, low pitch thing.\\n\\nROBERTS: Yes.\\n\\nBODETT: And I'm 63 years old, and I've been using power tools all my life, and I have no high-end hearing.\\n\\nROBERTS: Yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: And I was happy to hear Laurel.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So it's actually interesting. You can play with the audio to hear the differences. So if you pull out all the high frequencies, if you just remove them, it sounds like this.\\n\\nCOMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Laurel.\\n\\nSAGAL: Laurel - I mean, pretty clear, right? But if you isolate the high end, it sounds like this.\\n\\nCOMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Yanny.\\n\\nSAGAL: See? And if you remove everything but the bass notes, you get this.\\n\\nKURTIS: Bill Kurtis.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nRoger Severino is a successful civil rights lawyer. When he was at the Justice Department, he fought to uphold the rights of African-Americans trying to rent homes after Hurricane Katrina. And he won. For the last year, though, under President Trump, he has led the Office for Civil Rights in the Health and Human Services Department. And in that time, he has put the right to religious freedom front and center as he fights against discrimination in health care.\\n\\nHere's Severino back in January when he announced the creation of a Division of Conscience and Religious Freedom within HHS.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nROGER SEVERINO: Times are changing, and we are institutionalizing a change in the culture of government, beginning with HHS, to never forget that religious freedom is a primary freedom, that it is a civil right that deserves complete enforcement and respect.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak has this profile of Roger Severino.\\n\\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: There's a good chance you didn't know that the nation's health department has a team of lawyers dedicated to protecting your civil rights. Traditionally, they focus on making sure you're not denied medical care because of your race or gender or on protecting your medical privacy. Roger Severino says he plans to continue to defend those rights. But he's also made it clear that his top priority is to protect health care providers' religious freedom.\\n\\nSEVERINO: America's doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives. And they shouldn't be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience.\\n\\nKODJAK: When I sat down with Severino last month, he pointed me to his long and distinguished record of achievement in civil rights and says it took root in his childhood. He grew up in LA as the Spanish-speaking child of Colombian immigrants.\\n\\nSEVERINO: I had experienced discrimination as a child. And that leaves a lasting impression.\\n\\nKODJAK: Kids at the public pool where he took swimming lessons hurled racial epithets his way. And when he got to high school...\\n\\nSEVERINO: The menu of options I was given were remedial classes, the equivalent of shop class and a vocational class. And I said, well, don't you offer honors classes? And the counselor, who was white, said, yeah, but you'd have to take a test.\\n\\nKODJAK: Severino is conservative and a devout Catholic. He previously worked at the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on religious freedom. And he ran a center on religion at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Since he joined HHS just a year ago, he's issued a new rule that allows employers to refuse to cover birth control if they have a religious or moral objection. And he created the new Religious Freedom Division to ensure that health care workers and companies are never forced to participate in medical services like abortion if they object.\\n\\nSEVERINO: All we're doing is saying that we will be enforcing all the civil rights laws. And all those civil rights laws include conscience and religious freedom. And we believe they weren't given the proper attention for too long a time.\\n\\nKODJAK: Severino's critics say his efforts are likely to make it harder for women to get abortions. But they could go much farther. Several of his critics, including Judith Lichtman, met with the new civil rights director shortly after he joined HHS.\\n\\nJUDITH LICHTMAN: He opened the meeting telling us his heartfelt story about knowing and understanding discrimination. And frankly, you know, stories will get you just so far.\\n\\nKODJAK: Lichtman is a senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Families. She says Severino's actions since that meeting suggest he intends to protect people who want to discriminate against women who want birth control or abortions, which she points out are legal health care services.\\n\\nLICHTMAN: I say that's pretty abhorrent.\\n\\nKODJAK: Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality, was also at that meeting.\\n\\nHARPER JEAN TOBIN: Director Severino presents himself as a civil rights lawyer. And what he has done as OCR director is turn the idea of civil rights on its head.\\n\\nKODJAK: Traditional civil rights advocates, she says, have fought hard to make sure everyone can get the medical care they need. But Severino, she says, is instead fighting for the right of doctors to discriminate.\\n\\nTOBIN: No one is forcing doctors to perform gender-affirming surgeries against their will. But what is happening every day is transgender patients are being denied every kind of medical care you can think of.\\n\\nKODJAK: She says more than a third of transgender adults said in a survey that they had experienced health care discrimination in the last year. I reached out to several people who have worked with Severino and none would speak with me about him on the record. Those who spoke on background say he's a straight shooter who has a way of connecting with his clients. And they say they expect he'll apply the law fairly.

{"original": "White House Seeks To Lower Farmworker Pay To Help Agriculture Industry\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP\\n\\nNew White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is working with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to see how to reduce wage rates for foreign guest workers on American farms, in order to help U.S. farmers struggling during the coronavirus, according to U.S. officials and sources familiar with the plans.\\n\\nOpponents of the plan argue it will hurt vulnerable workers and depress domestic wages.\\n\\nThe measure is the latest effort being pushed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help U.S farmers who say they are struggling amid disruptions in the agricultural supply chain compounded by the outbreak; the industry was already hurting because of President Trump's tariff war with China.\\n\\nThe administration is considering all policy options during this unprecedented crisis to ensure our great farmers are protected, and President Trump has done and will do everything he can to support their vital mission, a White House official told NPR.\\n\\nThe nation's roughly 2.5 million agricultural laborers have been officially declared essential workers as the administration seeks to ensure that Americans have food to eat and that U.S. grocery stores remain stocked. Workers on the H-2A seasonal guest-worker program are about 10% of all farmworkers.\\n\\nThe effort to provide wage relief to U.S. farmers follows an announcement Friday by the USDA to develop a program that will include direct payments to farmers and ranchers hurt by the coronavirus. Trump said Friday that he has directed Perdue to provide at least $16 billion in relief.\\n\\nLast month, the U.S. State Department said it will start processing more applicants seeking H-2A temporary guest worker visas to ensure U.S. farmers have foreign workers in time for spring planting.\\n\\nThe most recent push to lower wage rates for workers on H-2A visas has drawn pushback from some strange bedfellows: immigrant-rights advocates and immigration hard-liners usually aligned with Trump.\\n\\nErik Nicholson, national vice president for the United Farm Workers, says people who have worked in agriculture for decades are concerned they are going to lose their jobs. And he said vulnerable guest workers are not being provided proper hand-washing facilities and still being forced to live in cramped housing.\\n\\nSo in the middle of a pandemic, rather than trying to figure out the cheap way to do things, we need to make sure we live up to the expectations society has of us as an industry to keep the food flowing, Nicholson said.\\n\\nGroups on the right fear Trump is succumbing to the will of the agriculture lobby that is demanding lower wages for foreign and domestic farmworkers at a time of record high unemployment in the United States.\\n\\nThe Department of Labor reports that 16.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment aid in the past few weeks.\\n\\nPresident Trump should see right through what the agriculture lobby is demanding in the name of 'food security' at the height of a health crisis – lower wages for American workers and more cheap foreign labor, said Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports immigration restrictions. These appalling demands underscore that the whole way this nation produces food should be reexamined.\\n\\nIt's unclear how the reforms would be made, including whether they would be taken through executive action or through the federal regulatory process. But Perdue has pushed for adjusting what is known as the adverse effect wage rate, which prevents farmers using the H-2A program from paying all workers — U.S. and guest workers — wages below the prevailing rates in the surrounding area.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Perdue said the adverse wage rate has set almost a $15 minimum wage for agriculture, noting no other business in the country has that, according to the agriculture trade journal DTN.\\n\\nThe adverse effect wage rates are based on a USDA survey of what agricultural workers are paid in each state. It's $11.71 in Florida, $12.67 in North Carolina and $14.77 in California.\\n\\nA USDA official told NPR that Perdue is working with Trump to resolve long-standing challenges facing the agriculture industry, including reforms to the H-2A program.\\n\\nThese challenges have been exacerbated by these uncertain times, the official said in a statement.\\n\\nU.S. farmers say they have had to cut back on production because of the high number of restaurant and hotel closures. Cory Lunde, a spokesman for the Western Growers Association, said U.S. farmers are fighting to keep our farms afloat in the face of the near-total collapse of the food-service sector and more recent slowdown in the retail market.\\n\\nLee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, said Trump administration officials are trying to look at ways to help because they understand that we're in trouble and they want to secure the food supply for the American people.\\n\\nWhen a farmer goes out of business, you know, he doesn't come back, Wicker said. Food supply is a national security issue and, as bad as this COVID-19 crisis is, perhaps it can be a catalyst to start a conversation about our agriculture policy and having sustainable agriculture and diversity."}

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell just over 4% and Japan's Nikkei 225 lost nearly 2.5%. The Shanghai Composite Index lost nearly 3.5%.\\n\\nThe drubbing for stocks follows the U.S. Federal Reserve's cut in its key interest rate to near zero, a dramatic move not seen since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed's move was made in coordination with efforts to buttress the global economy by the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.\\n\\nThe one-percentage-point decrease was the U.S. central bank's second emergency rate cut this month in an attempt to cushion the rapidly growing economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nThe Fed also announced plans to buy $700 billion in government securities.\\n\\nThe effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook, the Fed said in a statement announcing the moves Sunday. In light of these developments, the [Federal Open Market] Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent.\\n\\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking with reporters on a conference call, said: Families, businesses, schools, organizations and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect people's health. These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term.\\n\\nThe federal funds rate affects the cost of borrowing on everything from credit cards to auto loans.\\n\\nPresident Trump — who has often slammed the Fed for first raising rates and then not cutting them more quickly — praised the actions minutes later.\\n\\nIt's really great news and great for our country, Trump told reporters at the White House, adding that the Fed's announcement should cheer financial markets. Just on Friday, Trump had said he could demote Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he had appointed, from the top job at the Fed.\\n\\nBut U.S. stock market futures dove after the Fed's announcement. Futures in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points.\\n\\nIn cutting its key interest to zero, the Fed has practically lost a major policy tool — one that it would need if the economy tumbles into recession. But the Fed said its policymaking committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.\\n\\nLow rates make borrowing cheap, but they don't necessarily get businesses to increase workers' hours or get people shopping at a time when government officials are asking bars and restaurants to shut down and telling workers to stay home to stall the spread of the virus.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\\n\\nIn addition to the rate cut, the Fed also announced measures to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. It said it will boost its holdings of Treasurys by at least $500 billion and its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $200 billion in coming months.\\n\\nGlobal financial markets have been shaken deeply by the growing pandemic. And U.S. stock indexes have plummeted at least 20% from their recent record highs — putting the market in bear market territory after an 11-year winning streak. The Dow has fallen nearly 6,400 points since its record high on Feb. 12.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Dow jumped 9.3%, or 1,985 points, after posting its worst day since the Black Monday crash of October 1987. That rebound came as Trump declared a national emergency and announced several steps to deal with the coronavirus crisis. But the Dow still lost nearly 2,700 points for the week.\\n\\nThe coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, the Fed said Sunday.\\n\\nThe Fed last cut rates to near zero in December 2008, during the financial crisis, and kept them at that historic low until the end of 2015.\\n\\nSunday's emergency move was highly unusual because it came between scheduled Fed meetings. The Fed's next meeting is set for this Tuesday and Wednesday."}
{"original": "'Fresh Air' Marks The Return Of 'Better Call Saul' By Dipping Into The Archives\\n\\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. On Monday, the AMC Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul begins its fourth season. When Better Call Saul began in 2015, Terry spoke with writer-producer Peter Gould, who co-created the series with Vince Gilligan. Gould had created the character of Saul Goodman. And since Better Call Saul is a prequel set years before the events of Breaking Bad, it allowed the show's creators to explore Saul's past and the pasts of some other Breaking Bad characters as well, most specifically bodyguard and sometimes hitman Mike Ehrmantraut played by Jonathan Banks.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: So I always wondered, like, how did Saul and Mike get to know each other? And we find out in Better Call Saul. Did we know that on Breaking Bad? Did we know how they knew each other?\\n\\nPETER GOULD: Absolutely not. Mike was just conjured up when Saul Goodman needed him...\\n\\nGROSS: OK.\\n\\nGOULD: ...Like a genie.\\n\\nGROSS: OK, so we find out how they meet (laughter) in Better Call Saul. And the answer is that Mike is working at the ticket booth of the parking lot that adjoins the courthouse where Saul is working as a public defender. And Saul is always - well, at this point, he's Jimmy. And Jimmy is always so - just kind of in disarray that he never has time to get - or the money to get the proper amount of, like, parking stickers on his sticker to not pay for the parking. So he's coming to the ticket booth at the parking lot. And at the ticket booth, we hear a voice. And then we later see as the camera moves that it's Mike. Here's that scene. Jimmy's pulling out, stopping at the ticket booth and encountering Mike.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BETTER CALL SAUL)\\n\\nJONATHAN BANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Three dollars.\\n\\nBOB ODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) I'm validated. See the stickers?\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Well, I see five stickers. You're one shy. It's $3.\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) They gave me - look.; I'm validated for the entire day, OK? Five stickers, six stickers, I don't know from stickers because I was in that court back there saving peoples' lives, so...\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Oh, gee, that's swell. And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system. Now, you'll either pay the $3, or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker.\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) Son of a bitch. Fine, you win. Hooray for you. Backing up. I have to back up. I need more stickers, don't have enough stickers. Thank you. Thank you. Very nice. Employee of the month over here. Yeah. Hooray. Give him a medal.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSS: Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks in the first episode of Better Call Saul. Peter Gould, writing - coming up with the idea that that's how they would meet, why did you choose the ticket booth approach?\\n\\nGOULD: We just had the image of the most badass guy we know doing the least likely thing. Mike Ehrmantraut looking at stickers and taking money for parking - like, what the hell is he doing in that parking booth? And hopefully the audience is asking those same questions. And when we talked about it some more, we started figuring out why. And that really intrigued us.\\n\\nGROSS: And he's still the enforcer, but what he's enforcing is the number of parking stickers you need to exit the lot.\\n\\nGOULD: He's very stern about - he's very finicky about rules. He thinks there's a right way to do things. There - he's a strict professional.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Peter Gould, co-creator of Better Call Saul, speaking to Terry Gross in 2015. The new season of Better Call Saul premieres Monday on AMC. After a break, we'll continue Terry's conversation with Peter Gould. And we'll hear from two of the co-stars of Better Call Saul - Jonathan Banks, who plays Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito, who plays his ruthless mob boss Gus Fring. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, BETTER CALL SAUL)\\n\\nJUNIOR BROWN: (Singing) You drink one, drink two, drink three Long Island iced teas. But your buddy's worse off, and he throws you his car keys. Blue lights are blinking 4 o'clock in the morning. State trooper makes you wish that you'd never been born. Better call Saul, better call Saul. You want to tell the world...\\n\\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross, back with more of our salute to AMC's Better Call Saul, the Breaking Bad prequel and sequel that begins Season 4 on Monday. In a few minutes, we'll hear from two of the actors who worked on both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul - Jonathan Banks, who plays Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito, who plays Gus Fring. But first let's get back to Terry's conversation with Peter Gould, the co-creator of Better Call Saul. They spoke in 2015 when the show premiered.\\n\\nHere's a clip from the very first episode of Better Call Saul when Bob Odenkirk's Saul, then still operating under his given name of Jimmy McGill, is meeting with a young couple at a restaurant. He hopes to persuade them to hire him as their attorney. The husband, a government accountant, has just been accused of embezzlement.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BETTER CALL SAUL)\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) Look; all I know is what I read in the paper.\\n\\nJEREMY SHAMOS: (As Craig Kettleman) I know.\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) Typically when money goes missing from the county treasury - and the number here is 1.6 million...\\n\\nJULIE ANN EMERY: (As Betsy Kettleman) Well, that's an accounting...\\n\\nSHAMOS: (As Craig Kettleman) That's an accounting discrepancy.\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) It's a discrepancy. Absolutely. But typically when that happens, the police look at the treasurer. And since that person is - I just think a little proactivity may be in order.\\n\\nSHAMOS: (As Craig Kettleman) And I just think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer.\\n\\nEMERY: (As Betsy Kettleman) Yeah.\\n\\nODENKIRK: (As Jimmy McGill) Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones. And innocent people get arrested every day. And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend. Talk to me, he says. Help me clear this thing up. You don't need a lawyer. Only guilty people need lawyers. And boom, hey - that's when it all goes south. That's when you want someone in your corner - someone who will fight tooth and nail. Lawyers - yeah, we're like health insurance. You know, hope you never need it, but, man oh man, not having it? No (laughter).\\n\\nBIANCULLI: That's Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill, who eventually will become Saul Goodman, the familiar character from Breaking Bad. That clip featured Odenkirk as Jimmy, but Terry's question to writer-producer Peter Gould was about Saul.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: Bob Odenkirk said that he based his performance of Saul on Hollywood agents and the way that agents, like, try to manipulate their clients (laughter) into deals. Who did you base Saul on? Were you thinking of agents? Were you thinking of lawyers?\\n\\nGOULD: I think we were thinking about lawyers. I grew up in New York, and I had some lawyers in the family. And none of them were as fast-talking as Saul Goodman. And so it was just the idea of someone who is a free agent who has the gift of the gab. But there was always the sense that people were making their lives through their wits.\\n\\nGROSS: Let's play the very first scene that the character of Mike Ehrmantraut is in. And Jesse's girlfriend, Jane, has OD'd in bed. Jesse wakes up to find her dead. He calls Walt. Walt calls Saul, the lawyer. And Saul sends Mike, the fixer. And Mike cleans up all the evidence of drugs and tells Jesse what to do. Here's the scene in which that happens.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BREAKING BAD)\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Any other drugs in the house? Think hard. Your freedom depends on it. What about guns? You got any guns in the house? Here's your story. You woke up. You found her. That's all you know. Say it. Say it, please. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.\\n\\nAARON PAUL: (As Jesse Pinkman, sobbing).\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLAP)\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Say it. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.\\n\\nPAUL: (As Jesse Pinkman) I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Again.\\n\\nPAUL: (As Jesse Pinkman) I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Again. Again.\\n\\nPAUL: (As Jesse Pinkman) I woke up. I found her. That's all I know. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.\\n\\nBANKS: (As Mike Ehrmantraut) Once you call it in, the people who show up will be with the Office of Medical Investigations. That's primarily who you'll talk to. Police officers may arrive, they may not - depends on how busy a morning they're having. Typically, ODs are not a high-priority call. There's nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you just want your lawyer, and you call Saul Goodman. Do I need to state the obvious? I was not here.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) That's so great. And that's my guest, Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut.\\n\\nJonathan Banks, welcome to the conversation.\\n\\nBANKS: Thank you, Terry.\\n\\nGROSS: So, you know, it was supposed to be Saul who cleans up things for Jesse and tells him what to say. So, Peter Gould, it ended up being Mike. How did it end up being Mike?\\n\\nGOULD: We were going to have Saul Goodman come in and clean things up. Unfortunately, Bob was not available. Bob Odenkirk was not available to come to town, to come to Albuquerque for that particular scene. And so, very much at the last minute, Vince Gilligan had the inspiration of bringing in Mike the fixer or his private detective. He was - been mentioned a couple of times on the show. And, through some miracle, we cast Mr. Jonathan Banks.\\n\\nBANKS: I thought I was going to - you know, I'd thought I'd do a day's work and leave. Then it snowed, and I went in. And that scene where you hear the slap is - Aaron still complains about it. He didn't know it was coming.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBANKS: And I loved DuBois. But, you know, it was fun. I had a good time. And no, it came as a surprise. But - you know, you tell me if I'm wrong, Peter. But Peter and Tom Schnauz and Vince have been friends forever, and when they were kids in college, they used to watch Wiseguy. So they - I guess my character on Wiseguy made an impression on them.\\n\\nGROSS: And Wiseguy was a great TV series that started in 1987 and introduced actors like Stanley Tucci and Kevin Spacey. At least, that's where I found out about them.\\n\\nSo you mentioned that Aaron Paul didn't know that you were going to slap him in that scene. Is that considered acceptable for you to do that?\\n\\nBANKS: It's totally acceptable for me. I'm not...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBANKS: ...The one that got slapped.\\n\\nGOULD: The rules that apply to everybody else don't necessarily apply to Mr. Banks.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBANKS: You know, I get that senior pass, you know.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBANKS: And it's - you know, if you can't take a hit from an old guy - I mean, come on. Aaron can take a punch, for goodness' sakes.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) So, Jonathan Banks, you're a former cop in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. You've played a lot of cops and former cops over the years. And in Wiseguy, where I first saw you - a TV series that started in 1987 - you played the head of, like, an organized crime task force, and you were the supervisor for the Ken Wahl character who goes undercover every week. So how did you get to play so many cops and former cops? Like, what is it about you, do you think?\\n\\nBANKS: I'm not very pretty, so I can't play the leading man. So I'm either going to be the bad guy or the cop. And that's - you know what? It's a smart aleck answer, but it's also - there's some truth (laughter) in that in the world of Hollywood and television. If you're not beautiful, you'd better be able to act a little bit anyway.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) Were you a tough guy at all as a young man?\\n\\nBANKS: No. I mean, these guys that get up and say, I grew up in a tough neighborhood, it was this, it was that, it was this - the reality is they were sad neighborhoods. And if you were lucky enough to get out, oh, my gosh, how lucky I am. Yeah. And that's my answer.\\n\\nGROSS: I read your mother was in the CIA. Did you know...\\n\\nBANKS: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Did you know exactly what she did? Or was that, like...\\n\\nBANKS: Well...\\n\\nGROSS: ...A big secret?\\n\\nBANKS: I'll give you a - I'm going to - my mom's gone now. But my mother started out in life on her own completely at 15 years old as a maid in a Methodist parsonage in Bloomington, Ind. She was a whiz at shorthand and typing and dah-dah-dah (ph), they got her a job with the Navy Department in Washington, D.C. World War II came along. There was a period of time where she was Admiral Wilson's private secretary.\\n\\nAdmiral Nimitz, at one brief time, was a commander of the Pacific Fleet. After the war, she went to work, managed the secretarial pool - as I understood it - at the CIA under a woman named Peggy Hunt (ph). Back then, they would burn their carbons every day at the end of the day, and they had those oval-back chairs that the secretaries would sit in. And she taught her girls if someone came up behind them, that they would throw their elbows straight back, stand up and address them in a very loud voice. The thought being if it went past that moment, that it was not going to go in their favor.\\n\\nThey were secretaries, and whoever the man was that came up behind them was probably one of their superiors. Her bosses knew that that's what she taught, but that was pretty much the recourse that a woman had in the '50s - in the early '50s. There weren't any human resources to go to. And I mean this - I should be half the woman that my mother was.\\n\\nGROSS: It took me awhile to realize you were talking about sexual harassment there.\\n\\nBANKS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: And for people who don't know - when you said they burned their carbons, that's carbon paper that makes duplicates of what you're typing. Your mother must have typed a lot of secrets.\\n\\nBANKS: My mom - when the transcriptions came back from the Nuremberg trials, she was at the Treasury. And that's where the Secret Service used to be. And there was a tunnel that used to go under - and maybe it's probably still there - from the Treasury Department to the White House. So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff. And as far as sexual harassment goes, she always left her office door wide open. And she raised me by herself.\\n\\nGROSS: Thank you both so much for talking with us.\\n\\nBANKS: Thank you.\\n\\nGOULD: Thanks a lot.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Jonathan Banks and Peter Gould speaking to Terry Gross in 2015. Coming up, one more interview with a key player from Better Call Saul, Giancarlo Esposito, who plays the very soft spoken but very ruthless drug kingpin Gus Fring. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAVE PORTER'S ASS OVER TEA KETTLE)\\n\\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Giancarlo Esposito, who played drug kingpin Gus Fring in Breaking Bad, featured prominently in one of that show's most explosive and memorable episodes. Then, in Better Call Saul, we learn about the earlier years of Gus and how he rose from owner of a regional fast-food chicken franchise to international drug smuggler, manufacturer and distributor.\\n\\nTerry Gross spoke with Giancarlo Esposito last year when Better Call Saul was in its third season. And when Gus Fring - by that time - was juggling management of his Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant and his growing meth smuggling and selling business, those worlds were beginning to collide sometimes dangerously. In this scene from season three, Gus gathers his employees to talk about the men who had just visited the restaurant and menaced the staff. He promises his workers overtime pay and to pay for therapy if they needed counseling to deal with the trauma. Then the restaurant manager asks a question.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BETTER CALL SAUL)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Mr. Fring, who were those guys?\\n\\nGIANCARLO ESPOSITO: (As Gus Fring) Well, as some of you know, that many years ago, I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos in Michoacan. Shortly thereafter, those same men showed up. They wanted money, and I - I'm ashamed to say that I paid them. You see, in that place at that time - if I wished to conduct my business, I had no choice. But yesterday - yesterday they came here - here. They intimidated my customers. They threatened my employees. And again, they wanted money. Now, my friends, I must confess that I almost gave them what they wanted, but then I thought No. No. This is America. Here, the righteous have no reason to fear. Here, those men have no power. And when they saw that I had no fear of them, they ran like the cowards they are back across the border. They will not return. We will move on from this. My friends, I promise you that together we will prosper.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) All right (laughter).\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nGROSS: Giancarlo Esposito, welcome to FRESH AIR. I love that scene. I could listen to that over and over (laughter) and over again. And it's such a great moment because you seem like such - like the perfect manager. You're thoughtful. You're concerned about your staff and want to protect them. You're standing up to bullies. You're patriotic about America. I'd like to talk with you about your voice as Gus. It's a very kind of measured voice. You articulate every syllable. It's a very conscious way of speaking, and you also have the slight remains of an accent from - I forget which country Gus is from.\\n\\nESPOSITO: Chile.\\n\\nGROSS: Chile. Yeah. So can you talk about constructing that voice for Gus?\\n\\nESPOSITO: Yes. I try to let the words speak to me and jump off the page in silence so that I can hear the rhythm of what they are trying to write. In this case, obviously, Gus has a Chilean accent which I bring to the copy and then allowing my voice to join it in a whisper. And then from that whisper comes a sound so that I can allow what the writers have honored in this character and my voice to join together in a seamless way. I'm half-Italian and half-African-American, so I gesticulate. I'm very Italian. If you met me in person, I use my hands to speak. I wanted that to be diminished, and I wanted the calm and cool personality of Gus to emerge. So that whisper allowed me to relax and Giancarlo to go away.\\n\\nGROSS: The character of Gus is very meticulous. In his restaurant, he's often, like, emptying trays himself and cleaning up the tables and emptying the trash. And in his demeanor, I mean, his clothes, even his khaki pants, everything's always perfectly pressed and clean. He works at a restaurant. You will never see a stain on him. So is that you, or is that - is that something you brought to the character, or was that written into the script? And since he has so much blood on his hands, metaphorically, it's kind of interesting to see that kind of absolutely clean, pressed demeanor that he presents to the world.\\n\\nESPOSITO: This was not in the stage direction or in any direction or conversation when I first came to the show. But I wanted to create a character that was different, wasn't the Italian mobster with the little dog who spoke very softly or loudly, whichever one. We've seen those characters before. I wanted to create someone who was hiding in plain sight. That was my inspiration. That was the stage direction. And so that's someone, to me, that became Gus.\\n\\nSo that part of me that is meticulous, I did lend to Gus and wanted to allow that to be a part of him because he's very careful, very clean. He's an observer in many ways. He's a witness in other ways. And he's ruthless underneath all. So it allows me to stand differently. It allows me to feel regal. And I wanted to lend that quality, that royal, regal quality to Gus.\\n\\nGROSS: When you were given the role of - the reprised role of Gus in Better Call Saul, you knew you'd be playing him years earlier because it's a prequel. And your seasons of Breaking Bad started in - what? - 2009 or something?\\n\\nESPOSITO: Right around there.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. So you're playing a character who's supposed to be younger than you were in 2009. This is one of the, I think, issues that Better Call Saul has had to deal with, that the actors have grown older, but they're playing years younger than they were when we first saw them. So they're doing that without the use of prosthetics or, you know, like, things to take away wrinkles, as far as I've observed. So what was it like for you to figure out the younger version of your character?\\n\\nESPOSITO: It was a very interesting journey to think youthfully. I believe when you start to go back in time with a character, specifically in Better Call Saul for Gus, that you have to plant the seed in your head that you are younger. It's in the eyes. It's in the body first. And then there were the physical aspects of it where, you know, I have some grey now and I have more wrinkles. How do we deal with that?\\n\\nWell, we can darken the hair. I've also changed my hairstyle between both shows. And that was a big question for everyone, but I was emphatic and knew that it was the right move to make. A younger Gus would be maybe a little more wavier Gus, a Gus who had (laughter) - you know? - who actually may - you know, I wanted to give the sense that he - oh, he's a little - maybe even a little more handsome. Well, look at that hair. Look at those waves. He's not just the tough guy. He's the guy who actually you could see him going out on a date with a woman - maybe.\\n\\nSo I wanted a Gus that was more vulnerable, a Gus that was just a little bit more - a little younger in terms of his attitude. Not so definitive, knowing where he was going but not knowing exactly how to get there. So the element for me starts with the mental, and then it transfers to the physical. And then we work on the exterior to allow it to be younger and have that come forth.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Giancarlo Esposito, who plays Gus Fring in Better Call Saul, speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAVE BRUBECK'S UNSQUARE DANCE)\\n\\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's interview from last year with actor Giancarlo Esposito. He plays Gus Fring on AMC's Better Call Saul, which begins season four on Monday. It's a character he originated on that show's parent AMC series, Breaking Bad, which starred Bryan Cranston as high-school-teacher-turned-drug-kingpin, Walter White. Walter works with and for Gus Fring, but Gus has a problem. And in this scene from Breaking Bad, he's summoned Walter to a meeting in the desert. It's not a friendly meeting. Walter is on his knees, and Gus is angry that Walter's brother-in-law, a DEA agent named Hank, is getting closer to uncovering the meth manufacturing operation that Walter and Gus are conducting.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BREAKING BAD)\\n\\nESPOSITO: (As Gus Fring) In the meantime, there's the matter of your brother-in-law. He is a problem you promised to resolve. You have failed. Now it's left to me to deal with him.\\n\\nBRYAN CRANSTON: (As Walter White) You can't.\\n\\nESPOSITO: (As Gus Fring) If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter. I will kill your wife. I will kill your son. I will kill your infant daughter.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. So when you saw those lines (laughter) in the script...\\n\\nESPOSITO: (Laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: ...I will kill your wife. I will kill your son. I will kill your infant daughter - what was your reaction to that line? And how did you decide how you wanted to say it?\\n\\nESPOSITO: I was really blown away by this particular scene. And I thought I could go two ways. I could be, you know, an extrovert with these lines, or I could stay within the character I created and just whisper this very unveiled threat. I was a little shaken. I have children. I know Bryan has children. I'm looking at Walter White. And I'm allowing him to know that he has not only failed with Hank, but he's also failed with me. Walter would have been the perfect, perfect partner, the perfect person to start another business somewhere else with if he had only done the right thing.\\n\\nGROSS: So you decided to do the almost whisper version of that line.\\n\\nESPOSITO: I did. I feel like there's more power within than without. And I thought if I wanted to make my point, it would be in my eyes and also in the whispered cadence of my voice.\\n\\nGROSS: So in Breaking Bad, you have one of the really great - (laughter) great horrible death scenes. And it's a - now a very famous scene. You are blown up in an explosion intended to kill you. So the explosion happens behind closed doors. And then we assume you could not have survived that, but then you open the door and stumble out and straighten your tie in that still very meticulous way. And I'm thinking, like, what (laughter)?\\n\\nESPOSITO: (Laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: He survived, and he's straightening his tie? And then your head moves a little bit, and we see that half of your face is basically blown off. And it's just a really kind of shocking scene. So I'm wondering what that scene was like for you.\\n\\nESPOSITO: It's a very intense scene. And I was very nervous about it. It came from a conversation in Vince's office, where, after Episode 401, he called me in to let me know that the town was too big for both of us...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nESPOSITO: ...For Walter White (laughter) and myself and that I'd have to go. And then we talked about how Gus might go out of this world. And I was very, very passionate that it shouldn't move into a cheesy, supernatural way because I wanted Gus to die with dignity. Maybe - so I wanted to be able to portray the fact that maybe his - this long feud, this hate for Hector Salamanca, was something that would eventually take Gus away. In the end, it allowed me to feel dignified, especially the way the camera moved across the side of Gus' face that was still intact so that I could be able to do my action.\\n\\nVince asked me in that office that day, what might he be doing if an explosive event happened? And I said, well, Vince you see what I do. And I said this for a reason because I was inspired to do this show for many reasons. But I was inspired by a stage direction hiding in plain sight. I was inspired by a man who you thought you knew but did not. And that's what I based my character on.\\n\\nSo I said, Vince, you see me. I get up from a table - a chair. I button my jacket. If I sit back down, I unbutton it. And what do I do most? I straighten my tie to make sure the knot is correct so that I - so I wanted Gus to go out of the world with dignity. And I hope and I feel like I achieved that.\\n\\nBIANCULLI: Giancarlo Esposito, speaking to Terry Gross in 2017.

{"original": "Trudeau To Visit Trump; Differing Refugee Policies To Be Discussed\\n\\nPresident Trump on Monday welcomes Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the White House, where refugee policy and trade are expected to come up. Meanwhile, Trump's travel ban remains on hold.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump is playing host to Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the White House today.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nTrudeau says he's looking forward to discussing Canada's policies on immigration and refugees, which differ sharply from Trump's own.\\n\\nGREENE: And let's discuss that with NPR's Scott Horsley, who's on the line. Scott, good morning.\\n\\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\\n\\nGREENE: So while President Trump has tried to close the door on refugees from Syria, other countries, a lot of people in the world have pointed to Canada as having a policy that is totally different, that the welcome mat is really out. So how different are these two countries' approaches right now?\\n\\nHORSLEY: You know, David, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau both like to use Twitter. But their 140-character messages are 180 degrees apart.\\n\\nGREENE: Oh, I see what you did there (laughter).\\n\\nHORSLEY: The day after Trump issued his executive order, which was an attempt to halt refugees from entering the U.S. - along with visitors from those seven majority-Muslim countries - Justin Trudeau tweeted out, and I quote, to those fleeing persecution, terror and war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. And then he added the hashtag, #WelcomeToCanada.\\n\\nMARTIN: So, Scott, was that a dig at President Trump?\\n\\nHORSLEY: Well, it may have been a little bit of a dig. Canada also sees refugees and immigrants generally as an economic advantage. I mean, that's a lightly populated country. They're looking for people that can add to their economy. Last year, Canada took in about 56,000 refugees - last year. It's expected to take in about 40,000 refugees this year. On a per capita basis, Rachel, that would be the equivalent of the United States taking in something like 365,000 refugees in a year. Instead, the president's order would cap the number of refugees the U.S. accepts this year at around 50,000.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, Scott, let's talk about...\\n\\nHORSLEY: ...About one-seventh.\\n\\nGREENE: Let's talk about President Trump's policies because the travel ban - those seven countries - it remains really in limbo this morning, as this week starts, after that appeals court ruling late last week. What is - what is the White House's next move?\\n\\nHORSLEY: The White House says they're still exploring all of their legal options, which include going back to the full 9th Circuit and asking them to review the decision made by that three-judge panel last week. The White House could also appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. What is clear is the administration is still chafing at having its decisions, its policies questioned by federal judges. Over the weekend, the president tweeted about what he called a court breakdown, saying it's allowing refugees to keep entering the country. And White House adviser Stephen Miller made the president's case on NBC's Meet The Press.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, MEET THE PRESS)\\n\\nSTEPHEN MILLER: The bottom line is that a district judge - a district judge in Seattle cannot make immigration law for the United States, cannot give foreign nationals in foreign countries rights they do not have and cannot prevent the president of the United States from suspending the admission of refugees from Syria.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Now, it sounds there as if the White House is still arguing that judges don't have a role to play in overseeing immigration and national security policy, which is precisely the argument that the 9th Circuit rejected last week.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah, so even as the administration and the courts are still sparring over who can come into the country in this ruling, immigration authorities have already started deporting some people, right? What's going on?\\n\\nHORSLEY: Immigration authorities have been carrying out a series of raids, or enforcement actions, in cities around the country, taking people into custody, in many cases deporting them. It appears the officers are primarily targeting immigrants who have criminal records. But advocates say people whose primary offense is simply living or working in this country illegally have also been caught up in this dragnet.\\n\\nImmigration authorities are trying to kind of downplay this, saying the raids are just routine. But advocates for immigrants say there's been a real climate of fear created in the last week or so. And Trump himself did refer to this over the weekend as a crackdown. Of course, the president signed an order last month which gives immigration officers broader latitude to deport immigrants who are here illegally. Here's Stephen Miller again talking about this on Meet The Press.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, MEET THE PRESS)\\n\\nMILLER: If people don't like the immigration laws of the United States, they can reform them. Our emphasis is on deporting and removing criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety. And I just want to say this. There has been a lot of coverage in the news about the effects of these enforcement actions on people who are here illegally. And that's an issue people are free to discuss. But what's more important and what should be discussed more is the lives that are being saved, Chuck, the American lives that are being saved because we're taking enforcement action.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Now, Miller is a senior policy adviser in the White House. But he used to be a staffer for Senator - now Attorney General - Jeff Sessions. And Sessions' hard-line attitude on immigration was very much at odds with the Senate consensus back in 2013. However, that hard-line attitude is now driving policy in the Trump administration.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, Scott, is it worth noting when it comes to hard-line attitudes, specifically on deportations - I mean, there were a lot of critics who said President Obama, I mean, had a hard-line attitude and deported a whole lot of people.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Yeah, some of that depends on, you know, your definition. Who is actually being deported? Who's just being sent back across the border? Certainly, deportation swelled early in the Obama administration. They tapered off somewhat in the last couple of years. But the Obama administration really emphasized deporting serious criminals and those who had just crossed the border. So people who had been here working and living in the interior of the United States for many years didn't have a whole lot to fear in the latter years of the Obama administration. That's what we think could be changing now.\\n\\nMARTIN: So getting back to this meeting that's going to happen today with the prime minister of Canada and President Trump. Yes, they're probably going to talk about immigration. But also, there's a lot of economic stuff to talk about between these two leaders, right?\\n\\nHORSLEY: Yeah, there is. Canada is the United States' second-largest trading partner after China. And when President Trump talks about scrapping NAFTA, most of his ire's (ph) directed south, towards Mexico. But Canada is the other big player in that trade deal. So that is likely to be a focus of some discussion. Of course, the U.S. and Canada had a trade deal, a free trade agreement, before NAFTA went into effect.\\n\\nAnother issue that used to be a sore spot between the U.S. and Canada is the Keystone XL pipeline that President Obama blocked and which now President Trump has signaled he wants to greenlight. Oil producers in Western Canada are happy about that. Prime Minister Trudeau, however, who shares Obama's concern about climate change, is a less enthusiastic backer of the pipeline than his predecessor, Stephen Harper, was. So that may not be much of an icebreaker.\\n\\nGREENE: OK, the leaders of the United States and Canada meeting today. And that was NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks as always.\\n\\nHORSLEY: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Brazilian President Bolsonaro Withdraws From U.N. Compact On Migration\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIn his second week in office, far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has pulled the country out of a U.N. migration pact, fulfilling a pledge he made before taking office.\\n\\nBrazilian diplomats told local media on Tuesday that the country officially left the agreement. A diplomat also told Reuters that Brazil has exited the pact.\\n\\nBolsonaro appeared to confirm the withdrawal on Wednesday, tweeting, No to the compact on migration.\\n\\nDefense of national sovereignty was one of our campaign's banners and it will be a priority of our government, he wrote. The Brazilians and immigrants who live here will be safer under rules that we ourselves make, without external pressure.\\n\\nBrazil's departure from the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration marks the latest rejection of the non-binding agreement, which has drawn protest across the world, especially from far-right politicians in Europe. Nearly 30 countries, including the United States, refused to sign the pact in December.\\n\\nBrazil was among the majority of countries that signed onto the compact, under the country's previous administration.\\n\\nBolsonaro's decision to leave the agreement follows guarantees the president-elect and his foreign minister made last month, after a polarizing election and runoff.\\n\\nThe Bolsonaro government will withdraw from the Global Compact on Migration being launched in Marrakech, an inadequate instrument for dealing with the problem, tweeted Ernesto Araújo, now the country's foreign minister, in December. Immigration must not be dealt with as a global issue, but rather in accord with each country's reality and sovereignty.\\n\\nMore than 700,000 registered immigrants live in Brazil, according to the Migration Policy Institute, along with several hundred thousand more undocumented immigrants. By far the largest segment comes from Portugal, followed by Japan, Italy, Paraguay and Bolivia.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Brazil has become one of the primary destinations for an increasing number of Venezuelans fleeing a political and economic crisis at home. At least 65,000 Venezuelans have sought asylum in Brazil over the last four years, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\\n\\nGeoff Ramsey, assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, told NPR last fall that about a dozen tent camps were operating on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border.\\n\\nLast month, Araújo tweeted that Brazil would continue to welcome Venezuelan asylum-seekers even when it withdrew from the compact, though it would also focus on the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\\n\\nThe U.N. accord has become a focal point for anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally, called the agreement a pact with the devil. And in Brussels last month, thousands of protesters took to the streets carrying anti-immigration banners as they rallied against the pact.\\n\\nThe Trump administration refused to participate in the agreement more than a year ago, while other countries agreed to the pact last summer but pulled out before it was formally adopted, including Austria, Hungary, Italy, Chile and Australia.\\n\\nBolsonaro's government, now just over a week old, has drawn comparisons to the current U.S. administration, including in its rhetoric on refugees. On Wednesday, the Brazilian president echoed President Trump's language comparing national security to home security.\\n\\nIf we decide who we let into our own houses, why would we do any differently when it comes to our Brazil? he tweeted.\\n\\nIn a televised address on Tuesday night, Trump argued for his proposed border wall by pointing out that wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes.\\n\\nBolsonaro has taken his victory as a mandate to change the country's foreign policy, according to an op-ed by his foreign minister published in Bloomberg on Monday.\\n\\nWe are convinced that Brazil has a much larger role to play in the world than the one we currently attribute to ourselves, Araújo wrote."}
{"original": "To Keep Drivers From Leaving, Uber Tries To Treat Them Better\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Liam James Doyle/NPR Liam James Doyle/NPR\\n\\nUpdated at 3:26 p.m. ET\\n\\nUber's leadership already has a lot on its plate, starting with finding a new CEO after former chief Travis Kalanick resigned abruptly last month. But that's not all the tech giant has to do. For the business to survive, Uber also has to repair its relationship with drivers, which leaders at the company say is broken.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, in an ongoing effort dubbed the 180 Days of Change, the company is announcing reforms to its harsh termination policies and launching a hotline so that drivers in distress can reach a person at corporate headquarters.\\n\\nJanelle Sallenave is in charge of improving the way Uber responds to drivers' and riders' needs, disputes and accidents. It's clear to her that drivers, the lifeblood of the transportation platform, are choosing to leave because of poor treatment. This is an existential threat to the business, valued at $70 billion, and it needs to be tackled, she says.\\n\\nSallenave persuaded the executive leadership team, which is steering the ship while the Uber Board looks for a new CEO, to approve the creation of a hotline. Until now, Uber has not had a phone number for drivers to call, even in emergencies — such as an accident on the road or a violent passenger.\\n\\nIn June, NPR reported on the difficulties this omission has created for drivers, in a series called The Faceless Boss. Sallenave agrees with the characterization. As we've grown into a global, scalable company, she says, we need to move away from the facelessness of what the company has inadvertently become.\\n\\nIn earlier days, Sallenave says, each city had a local team to oversee Uber operations and drivers might have the cell number of the general manager. But once Uber centralized its system, in an effort to aggressively scale up, we were so focused on the rocket ship of growth that corporate leaders let communication systems fall apart.\\n\\nIt evolved in a very organic way unfortunately to something that almost feels like a chatbot, she says. That is not a compliment. Drivers were forced to communicate with Uber via text messaging — six exchanges on average. Now, under the new system, they would be able to make one phone call instead.\\n\\nUber is also reforming its three-strikes law. Previously, a driver with three complaints would be terminated from the platform. It would not matter whether the driver had completed 10 rides or 10,000. The policy was adversarial, and assumed drivers did not have positive intent.\\n\\nNow the company will consider a number of factors: how long a person has been driving, overall ratings, who are the people filing complaints. The decision to terminate, or in Uber lingo deactivate, a driver will still be made by software, but using a far more complex formula that Sallenave hopes is holistic.\\n\\nUber is also working to replicate an appeals panel that the company piloted in Seattle, for drivers who believe they've been unfairly terminated.\\n\\nMore than half a million people a month in the U.S. drive for Uber. The company has not disclosed how many choose to leave the platform. But as Sallenave acknowledges, in the gig economy it's easy to leave one job for another, to switch from Uber to competitor Lyft or a food delivery service.\\n\\nDrivers have welcomed Uber's recent overtures — such as the move to allow in-app tipping — but it's not yet clear whether this effort will inspire loyalty, or if other changes by Uber will undermine these efforts.\\n\\nDawn Gearhart, policy coordinator with the Teamsters Local 117 in Seattle, says Uber is feeling pressure on every front — not just from competitors, but also from efforts to organize drivers into labor unions such as hers.\\n\\nWhen a company feels threatened by organizing, she says, it's standard practice to dole out small wins to workers, such as vacation or a slight raise.\\n\\nThese things are not happening because somebody at the company woke up and they decided they were feeling better about the workers, Gearhart says. They just want to make sure that they maintain the balance of power.\\n\\nShe also points out that in recent weeks, many Uber drivers are earning less per ride because the company changed its fare structure.\\n\\nA study commissioned by Uber indicates that even when fares go down, drivers' earnings remain stable because demand for rides is up."}
{"original": "The Stakes Are High As China And The U.S. Resume Trade Talks\\n\\nNPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator, about the U.S.-China trade talks, which resumed Monday in Beijing.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nThe U.S. and China resumed trade talks in Beijing today. Negotiators picked up where President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping left off on December 1. The leaders agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war, a temporary hold on any additional tariffs. If there's no deal, Trump says he'll increase tariffs on a bunch of Chinese goods March 1. Over the weekend, he sounded optimistic.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRES DONALD TRUMP: The China talks are going very well. I spoke to President Xi recently. I really believe they want to make a deal. The tariffs have absolutely hurt China very badly.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Wendy Cutler is a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. Welcome.\\n\\nWENDY CUTLER: Thank you.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: What's the goal of the U.S. delegation in Beijing this week?\\n\\nCUTLER: I think their primary goal will be to assess the seriousness of the Chinese delegation in addressing the range of U.S. concerns with respect to China's market. Now, those include the lack of market access, high tariffs, high bilateral trade deficit, forced technology transfer, lax intellectual property protection enforcement and other issues as well.\\n\\nChina has rolled out in the past few weeks a number of measures and have made a number of announcements about increasing purchases of U.S. soybeans, temporarily reducing the U.S. auto tariff and stepping up IPR enforcement.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: That's intellectual property rights.\\n\\nCUTLER: Correct. And at this meeting, I think the United States will be very interested on hearing more details and more specificity and the time frames for these announcements that China has made. And I think they'll also be looking for additional concessions by China as well.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: So we just heard President Trump say he thinks China has a vested interest in cutting a deal because U.S. tariffs are hurting them. Do you see evidence of that? Do you think that's true?\\n\\nCUTLER: Absolutely. I think the tariffs are having an effect on the Chinese economy, but I also think they're affecting the U.S. economy. So I think both sides are coming to the table, trying to strike a deal, wanting a deal, but I don't think a deal at any cost. And so we'll have to see if they can find common ground if both sides have the flexibility to move off their positions and to find a negotiated solution.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: And how absolute do you think that March deadline is? If the two sides are close to a deal, do you think it could move?\\n\\nCUTLER: Oh, I think that if substantive progress is made and some breakthroughs are made on certain issues, that we may see a rollover of the talks and the continuation of the tariff truce while both sides continue to negotiate. That's normal.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: You know, President Trump can be so impulsive. He often undermines aides and contradicts advisers. Do you think the parties can negotiate in good faith here, or is there a risk that Trump might blow up whatever they might agree to?\\n\\nCUTLER: As we've seen, there's always a risk, as you mentioned. That said, I think the fact that Ambassador Lighthizer is leading these talks is very important. I think the president has a lot of confidence in Ambassador Lighthizer, particularly...\\n\\nSHAPIRO: This is Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative.\\n\\nCUTLER: Correct, particularly given Lighthizer's success in negotiating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. And so I think that Lighthizer goes into these talks with a lot of credibility and the backing of the president.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: And what are the stakes here if the two sides can't reach a deal?\\n\\nCUTLER: The stakes are extremely high. I think if the tariffs go up to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports into the United States, the U.S. is going to be feeling this very quickly across our economy. And I think there'll be quick reverberations in our markets. And I think that the Chinese markets in other corners of their economy will respond as well. And I think overall global economic growth will sink. And so the stakes are very high.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: That's Wendy Cutler, former acting deputy U.S. trade representative during the Obama administration, now with the Asia Society Policy Institute. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nCUTLER: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Ivanka Trump Launches $50 Million Program To Empower Women In The Workplace\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nFirst daughter Ivanka Trump wants to help 50 million women around the world realize their economic potential by 2025.\\n\\nExperts who work with women's issues in the global development community are hopeful about the new initiative – but raise questions about the timing of the announcement and the lack of specifics.\\n\\nTrump, a senior adviser to President Trump, announced the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative last week in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nIt aims to get all U.S. foreign assistance agencies – including the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Peace Corps and six others – to give top priority to push for women's economic development.\\n\\nAnd it sets up a $50 million fund for USAID to invest in new programs that can help make it easier for women to find jobs, start their own businesses and do business. A White House press conference about the initiative identified the range of women who might be helped, from a dairy farmer in Georgia to the founder of a women's group in Malawi.\\n\\nThis new initiative will for the first time coordinate America's commitment to one of the most undervalued resources in the developing world – the talent, ambition and genius of women, Trump wrote in the Journal.\\n\\nIn a memorandum, President Trump said the initiative will build on his administration's growing portfolio of women's economic empowerment programs, including the Ivanka Fund – a World Bank project that she created to award grants to development banks to support women entrepreneurs around the world – and other efforts at USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).\\n\\nThe initiative has three main focuses, or pillars, as the administration calls it: providing women with the education and skills training they need to enter the workforce; helping them succeed as business owners through financing, access to markets and networks; and addressing other barriers – legal, regulatory and cultural – that keep them from working.\\n\\nAccording to the World Bank, 2.7 billion women in 112 countries are legally excluded from certain industries, like mining and construction or other jobs deemed morally inappropriate, like serving alcohol or working in casinos. It's also legal in 18 countries for husbands to prevent their wives from working.\\n\\nThe presidential memorandum calls on U.S. foreign assistance agencies to dedicate at least $300 million annually to programs that advance the three pillars, while the $50 million USAID fund will finance additional programs. The initiative also plans to advance its goals through partnerships with non-governmental organizations and private companies, like Pepsi and UPS.\\n\\nNancy Lee, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former U.S. Treasury official, says the initiative could be truly transformative if it actually brings women's issues to the forefront of all development efforts – whether that means including women in the efforts of farmers to bring food to market or inviting them to be leaders in a peace-building efforts.\\n\\nAt USAID, we're thrilled, said USAID Administrator Mark Green at a press briefing last week. We've been working on women's empowerment, but now we have an across-the-board interagency effort, the full force of the U.S. government behind this.\\n\\nBut some — especially development experts who have designed such initiatives — are concerned that without specific goals and more details, it's just a political show.\\n\\nAll I've seen about this initiative is a whole lot of generic talk of the importance of empowering women without actually setting out a plan or a clear roadmap how to get there, says Brett Bruen, president of the Global Situation Room and former director of global engagement in the Obama administration.\\n\\nHe believes the initiative is just a way to enhance the administration's reputation ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, especially in the wake of cuts to global women's programs from the Trump administration.\\n\\nLast year, President Trump proposed a 35 percent funding cut for global gender-equality programs, though Congress eventually rejected the cuts. The Trump administration has also reinstated what's known as the global gag rule to block U.S. aid money from funding any organizations that perform abortions, offer information about the procedure or support more liberal abortion laws.\\n\\nDevelopment experts, on Twitter and beyond, say that if this initiative must address topics like reproductive rights and health or else women will not have the freedom to fully participate in the workforce.\\n\\nGlobal women's empowerment means looking at the many ways they are disempowered daily - violence, lack of choice when it comes to their own bodies, and discrimination ... and then changing those things that hold them back. That is meaningful empowerment. https://t.co/k8tdCmyZgH — Gayatri Patel (@gpatelcareusa) February 8, 2019\\n\\nThe bedrock of a woman's empowerment is the human right to decide when and if to have children. No full participation in the work force or eco empowerment without access to #familyplanning, sexuality education, safe #abortion. Must be included if new #WGDP is to be a success. https://t.co/t7IGDjQZZO — Katja Iversen (@Katja_Iversen) February 7, 2019\\n\\nIt has not yet been disclosed what kind of proposals will be submitted by whom for the benefit of which 50 million women. Even if USAID targets the most vulnerable women in developing countries with that fund, so far, there have been no official public stipulations to ensure that they – not elite women in those countries – will receive the rest of the aid.\\n\\nMaking sure that the poorest and most marginalized populations are reached is a critical piece of this initiative, says Aria Grabowski, senior policy adviser for Oxfam America.

{"original": "Judge Says Ken Cuccinelli Was Appointed Unlawfully To Top Immigration Post\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty Images\\n\\nA federal judge ruled on Sunday that Ken Cuccinelli's appointment to a top immigration position in the Trump administration was unlawful, saying several directives issued by Cuccinelli to tighten asylum rules must now be set aside.\\n\\nIn a 55-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said the administration violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act when it tapped Cuccinelli in June 2019 to lead U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that oversees legal immigration into the country.\\n\\nThe ruling invalidated a pair of directives issued by Cuccinelli, an immigration hard-liner and the former attorney general of Virginia, that introduced new restrictions on the asylum process.\\n\\nThe first directive shortened the length of time asylum-seekers have to prepare for credible fear interviews with officials from 48 or 72 hours to one full calendar day from the date of arrival at a detention facility. With the second, Cuccinelli prohibited asylum officers from granting extensions to this new policy except in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\\n\\nOn the merits, the Court concludes that Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as acting Director and that, as a result, he lacked authority to issue the reduced-time-to-consult and prohibition-on-extensions directives, Moss wrote in his ruling.\\n\\nUnder the 1998 vacancies law, when a Senate-confirmed leader of a federal office resigns, it falls to the first assistant of that vacant office to assume responsibility on an acting basis.\\n\\nBut Cuccinelli didn't work at USCIS prior to leading it. Instead, the acting head of DHS at the time, Kevin McAleenan, appointed Cuccinelli 'to serve as the Principal Deputy Director of [USCIS],' a position that did not exist prior to Cuccinelli's appointment, the judge noted.\\n\\nThen McAleenan changed the order of succession to make the principal deputy director the first assistant, allowing Cuccinelli to leapfrog the existing deputy director to become the agency's acting director.\\n\\nHere, the acting Secretary created a position that is second in command in name only, the judge wrote.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision. In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said, We obviously disagree with the court's decision and will be looking closely at the decision.\\n\\nSunday's ruling stemmed from a case brought by immigrant advocacy groups on behalf of five asylum-seekers from Honduras. The asylum-seekers say Cuccinelli's directives did not give them adequate time to speak with lawyers and family members about their cases before they met with asylum officials.\\n\\nImmigration officers found that the asylum-seekers — two women and three children — did not have a credible fear of persecution. Both women separately said they had been raped and faced other violence back in Honduras. All five were then subject to orders for expedited removal.\\n\\nBut Moss said because Cuccinelli did not have the authority to issue the directives, the women's credible-fear determinations would be vacated and they would not face expedited removal until a legally sufficient interview occurs.\\n\\nTo be sure, the Court has concluded that the two directives are invalid and must be set aside, Moss wrote.\\n\\nIt remains unclear what the ruling might mean for Cuccinelli, who still leads USCIS and in November became the second-highest official at the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nA vocal supporter of President Trump, Cuccinelli has drawn attention for his controversial rhetoric around immigration. In an August interview with NPR, he twisted Emma Lazarus' famous words on a bronze plaque at the Statue of Liberty, changing the quote to say, Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\\n\\nDemocracy Forward, one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, called the decision both a victory for the rule of law and a significant blow to the Trump administration's xenophobic agenda.\\n\\nWe are proud to share this legal victory with the brave asylum seekers who brought the Trump administration to court to ensure that the United States stays true to its tradition of providing a haven for those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum in America, said Anne Harkavy, the group's executive director."}
{"original": "The Latest On Tensions Between U.S. And Iran\\n\\nTensions again increase between the U.S. and Iran, as the first anniversary approaches of the American drone strike that killed an Iran's top military commander.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nIt was a year ago that a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and nine others. He was the country's most powerful military figure. Iran has vowed to avenge his death, and the U.S. has warned not to and has been flying bombers over the region. NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us. Peter, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nPETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.\\n\\nSIMON: And please remind us about the chain of events last year.\\n\\nKENYON: Well, tensions have been high for quite some time. There was an American contractor killed in Iraq, and the U.S. went after the Iran-backed militias they were holding responsible for that death. Tensions continue to increase. Militiamen at one point seemed like they were about to storm the U.S. Embassy. Then came this American drone strike. It killed Soleimani and an Iraqi militia deputy commander, among others. Tehran then hit back with missile attacks on Iraqi bases where U.S. military personnel were stationed - no casualties there. But Iranian officials have been saying they're not finished. They've got more avenging to do for Soleimani's killing.\\n\\nSIMON: Of course, President Trump's about to leave office. Why this muscle-flexing now?\\n\\nKENYON: Well, there's been signals being sent on both sides. And on the aggressive side of things, we've been seeing American B-52s flying over the region. That prompted the foreign minister of Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to take to Twitter to complain about, quote, a plot to fabricate a pretext for war. Last month, Washington was blaming these Iran-backed militias again for another rocket attack targeting the U.S. Embassy compound.\\n\\nBut then, on the more peaceful side, the Pentagon just announced it's withdrawing the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz at a moment of raised tension, sending it back to home port. That's seen by some as a sign the U.S. isn't looking for a clash right now. In Iran, it's easy to find angry rhetoric in the media and on the air aimed at Washington, but also qualifications such as, we don't have to avenge Soleimani's death right on January 3. That would be the one-year anniversary. It could happen any time, maybe much later. But no one can rule out happening sooner either, unfortunately.\\n\\nSIMON: Does the fact that the Trump administration, which ordered the strike, is in its final days offer an out to both sides?\\n\\nKENYON: It could. I mean, the possibility exists. Biden and his team have certainly signaled that they intend to shift Iran policy onto a less confrontational footing. Getting into a clash might make that harder to do. Possibly, he may even return to this 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, the one that Trump pulled the U.S. out of in 2018.\\n\\nSIMON: The head of Iran's civilian Atomic Energy Organization said today, I gather, that his agency's ready to enrich uranium up to 20%, far lower than the 90% weapons-grade enrichment but considerably higher than what the Iran nuclear deal allowed, which was under 4%. Is there anything left of the 2015 deal to save?\\n\\nKENYON: Well, there is, believe it or not. Everything that's been done on both sides - the U.S. putting the sanctions back on Iran, Iran violating some of the limits in the deal, including this latest announcement about enriching to 20% - all of that can be reversed. But it may not be just as simple as, OK, the deal's back on again. Snap your fingers, and it's done. The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, says that's not really easy. They can't go back to square one because things have changed. Time has moved on. What he says is that new negotiations are needed, and that won't happen overnight. In fact, Iran is resisting the idea of new negotiations at all, saying, first, get back into the old deal, and then we can talk.\\n\\nSIMON: NPR's Peter Kenyon speaking from Istanbul.

{"original": "Turning To VPNs For Online Privacy? You Might Be Putting Your Data At Risk\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stuart Kinlough/Ikon Images/Getty Images Stuart Kinlough/Ikon Images/Getty Images\\n\\nWorried about Internet companies snooping on your online browsing? You might turn to something called a virtual private network to protect your privacy. But researchers say these networks can themselves be insecure.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the federal government rolled back rules that would have prevented Internet service providers from tracking your activity online.\\n\\nComcast, AT&T and other providers are now allowed to track and sell your personal data too — with much less fear of regulatory action. (Major providers insist that they don't sell their customers' browsing histories.)\\n\\nOne solution is a VPN, which is like a dark, secret tunnel you use to go from your computer to a website. While you're inside the tunnel — clicking on Instagram photos or checking your bank account — third parties can't see what you're doing. The data are encrypted.\\n\\nThere are lots of reasons people around the world use VPNs: to hide location, to access work networks, even to avoid government censorship. Loraine Kanervisto, a software engineer in Seattle, downloaded a VPN on their computer and cellphone to prevent spying.\\n\\nThe more I read about how much power my Internet service provider is getting, the less inclined I am to share that data with them willingly, Kanervisto says. (Editor's note: Kanervisto uses the pronouns they, them and their.)\\n\\nNPR reached out to six popular VPN companies and all have seen double-digit increases in downloads since Congress repealed Internet privacy rules.\\n\\nRyan Dochuk, co-founder of TunnelBear, says his company had a 200 percent increase in the usual amount of people joining from the U.S. in March, when the federal rules were rolled back, and demand continues to be strong.\\n\\nBefore, where there were services that might collect a chunk of your browsing habits, like Google or Facebook, this change allows U.S. ISPs to collect 100 percent of your Web browsing and sell it to third parties, he says.\\n\\nInternet providers handle customer privacy in different ways. Some say you have to opt in for them to sell your data. Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, a privacy advocacy group, says because of Internet-connected devices, providers can see more than the websites you browse.\\n\\nThe Internet is in everything — increasingly in your house, in your smart water meter, in your refrigerator, in your toothbrush. The Internet service provider to your home knows a whole bunch of stuff about you, O'Connor says.\\n\\nSo, who cares whether Time Warner Cable or Verizon knows when I turn off my lights or whether I stock my fridge with Swiss or cheddar?\\n\\nFor one thing, those data points can be used to target advertising, O'Connor says. And she worries the government or private companies could use the information to deny services, like health insurance — or even water.\\n\\nYou can think of water rationing in certain parts of the country being enforced via your smart water meter or your other devices, O'Connor says. So it's a level of intrusion into the home and into your daily lives that we think people should be really mindful of and guard against.\\n\\nSome VPNs promise anonymous browsing for free or just a few dollars a month; they claim not to share your data. But these services don't always deliver on their promises.\\n\\nIf you're not careful with choosing your VPN service provider, the medicine might be worse than the illness, says Nick Feamster, a computer science professor at Princeton University. He says tens of millions of people have downloaded VPNs — and many don't realize they're not as secure as they claim.\\n\\nIn the first major review of VPN providers, researchers from across the globe tested nearly 300 free VPN apps on Google Play. What they found was alarming. Nearly 40 percent injected malware or malvertising. And nearly 20 percent of the apps didn't even encrypt user traffic.\\n\\nThis month, the Center for Democracy & Technology filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging the VPN Hotspot Shield collects data and intercepts traffic. If true, that would be a direct violation of claims by the company's policy to never log or store user data.\\n\\nAmid all the VPN angst, the app TunnelBear is fighting for its reputation. To verify it is committed to protecting user security, the company became the first in the industry to complete a third-party audit.\\n\\nFeamster, with Princeton, says that's very encouraging — even though the most recent audit turned up some vulnerabilities.\\n\\nExperts say the safest option is to set up your own VPN server and connect to it, or use Tor to browse the Web anonymously. But Feamster admits most people won't do that.\\n\\nFor now, he suggests researching a VPN before using it and to think of it as a supplemental tool, not a privacy solution. He advises reading the VPN service provider's privacy policy to see whether it collects or retains any user information that could be traced back to you — and if so, for how long.\\n\\nIf you're looking to use a VPN, this comparison chart is a good resource. And, if you're feeling adventurous enough to build your own, Ars Technica provides this helpful guide."}
{"original": "Twitter Permanently Suspends President Trump's Account Ahead Of Inauguration Day\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nDonald Trump has been permanently banned from Twitter. After four years of firings, announcements and insults by a presidential tweet, the company said it made the decision, quote, due to the risk of further incitement of violence. Further incitement, it said, like what preceded Wednesday's shocking insurrection at the Capitol. White House correspondent Tamara Keith has been following this.\\n\\nTam, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Glad to be with you.\\n\\nSIMON: I'm inclined to say what prompted this ban, but I mean, in a funny way, what didn't?\\n\\nKEITH: Right. According to Factbase, which is a site that tracks him, by the time Trump's account was suspended, nearly 500 of his tweets had been flagged by Twitter, mostly related to election misinformation. And that came after four years of riling up his supporters to hate Democrats, the media, anyone who wasn't loyal to him. Remember; there were those modified videos that he tweeted of him wrestling the CNN logo or shooting up a room full of his opponents. You know, all of that rhetoric reached a boiling point Wednesday when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. His account was locked Wednesday, and Twitter warned that it would be suspended if he further broke the rules. But then he tweeted again yesterday once it was unlocked. And what he tweeted was that those who voted for him will continue to have a voice and that he would not be attending Joe Biden's inauguration. The company said those tweets are likely to further incite violence, so it made the suspension permanent.\\n\\nSIMON: And what has the reaction been from the president and his supporters?\\n\\nKEITH: Well, after the ban last night, Trump tried to get around it. He tweeted from the @POTUS account, then a campaign account, a campaign adviser's account. It was like whack-a-mole, and Twitter took them all down. The White House then also sent the statement via the White House press pool, you know, like, the old-fashioned way. In it, Trump complained of being silenced and said he and his supporters are negotiating with other sites and looking into building their own platform. I was listening to conservative talk radio on my way home from the White House last night. And Mark Levin, who is an ally of the president's, was encouraging everyone to delete Twitter and Facebook and move to Parler, which is another platform with conservative backing and a lot less moderation. But that platform is now getting pressure from Google and Apple.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah. Tam, we have all reported on countless tweets over the past four years from Donald Trump. How big a blow is this ban to his determination to remain a huge public figure post-presidency?\\n\\nKEITH: Yeah, it has been essential to how he built his support, how he got his message directly to the people, including firing people, as we said before, commanding loyalty, even, you know, introducing or tanking legislation. Here's what he said about it on Fox in 2013.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've destroyed bills that were going to be voted on that were bad, and I've gotten bills passed that were good by using Twitter. And Twitter is really a typewriter for me. It's really not Twitter. It's - Twitter goes on television. You know, if they have breaking news, I'll tweet. I'll say, watch this. Boom.\\n\\nKEITH: And then breaking news - he tweeted. For posterity, at the time his account was banned, he had sent 57,067 tweets. Twitter was his voice, all-caps, ending with an exclamation point.\\n\\nSIMON: Democrats introduced an impeachment motion, I guess, on Monday, barring, they say, a resignation by the president. We don't expect a resignation, do we?\\n\\nKEITH: We don't. He's hanging on as far as we know. And the real question is, what does his political future look like, especially if he doesn't have his megaphone and if he's just the man behind the curtain?\\n\\nSIMON: NPR's Tamara Keith, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nKEITH: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "'Very Much Alive': Biden Projected To Win South Carolina\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 10:37 p.m. ET\\n\\nJoe Biden has run for president three times, and yet until Saturday, he had failed to ever win a primary or caucus.\\n\\nThe 77-year-old former vice president has now notched an expected yet much-needed victory in the South Carolina primary, according to The Associated Press's projection.\\n\\nJust days ago, the press and the pundits had declared his candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you — the heart of the Democratic Party — we just won and we've won big because of you, and we are very much alive, an energized Biden said at event with supporters in Columbia, S.C.\\n\\nThe crucial win has the potential to resurrect Biden's campaign after a series of poor finishes in the other early voting states (fourth place in Iowa, fifth place in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada).\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nThis result totally resets the race. The fact that Joe Biden won big — and the result was clear early in the evening during prime time in the eastern time zone — provides an enormous boost to his campaign. If Joe Biden can ultimately defeat Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, we will look back on this night as a key moment in American political history, Republican strategist Whit Ayres told NPR.\\n\\nA majority of Democratic primary voters in South Carolina are African American. And pointing to polls, Biden has long insisted that he has more support from black voters than any other presidential candidate does and that the Democratic nominee will need strong backing from African American voters to win the general election.\\n\\nBiden's win was not a surprise. For months, polls had shown him with a double-digit lead over his opponents, but in recent weeks, the race tightened. In a sign of how vulnerable he was, Biden campaigned exclusively in South Carolina this week, even as a number of his opponents traveled to states that will vote in coming days.\\n\\nBiden also received a last-minute public endorsement from the most influential black Democrat in South Carolina politics, U.S. Rep. James Clyburn.\\n\\nI've known for a long time who I was going to vote for, Clyburn said at a press conference on Wednesday. I'm voting for Biden. South Carolinians should be voting for Joe Biden.\\n\\nBiden made a point to credit the congressman with injecting his campaign with a huge jolt at his post-vote event: My buddy Jim Clyburn — you brought me back!\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nStill, Biden's victory does not put to rest some underlying questions about the health of his campaign and his ability to translate this victory to other states.\\n\\nHours before Biden's victory was official, Clyburn was already calling for a retooling of his campaign.\\n\\nIn an interview on CNN on Saturday, he said he had earlier avoided publicly analyzing the operation because he had held off officially backing Biden. That's changed. I'm all-in and I'm not going to sit back idly and watch people mishandle this campaign, Clyburn said.\\n\\nBiden has tried to draw parallels between his campaign and that of Bill Clinton, who got a key win in the South Carolina Democratic nominating contest in 1992, en route to the presidency.\\n\\nBut as this year's primary season quickly turns into a national fight, with 14 states voting on Tuesday, there are questions about whether Biden has the grassroots energy or the money to compete with the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.\\n\\nSanders is seen as the front-runner, and he has spent far more energy and resources in the states voting on Super Tuesday.\\n\\nBloomberg is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, while competing for the same moderate voters that might be attracted to Biden's message on gun control and health care.\\n\\nMinutes after television networks projected Biden as the winner, Terry McAuliffe, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee and former governor of Virginia, endorsed Biden on CNN. McAuliffe said it came down to an electability issue for him.\\n\\nI think Joe Biden has the best chance of winning Virginia in the general election, McAuliffe said.\\n\\nSanders, speaking at a rally in Virginia Beach, Va., congratulated Biden.\\n\\nI am very proud that in this campaign so far we have won the popular vote in Iowa, we have won the New Hampshire primary, we have won the Nevada caucus — but you cannot win them all, Sanders said.\\n\\nSanders said there will be other contests he doesn't win in the next round of primaries. But he reiterated his argument that the same playbook from the Democratic establishment won't work in November.\\n\\nThe 'same old, same old' type of politics – that is not going to be the campaign that defeats Trump, Sanders said.\\n\\nBiden didn't mention Sanders directly Saturday night, but he took a swipe at his status as an independent.\\n\\nIf the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat — a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat — join us, he said to voters in the upcoming primaries.\\n\\nPete Buttigieg, former Mayor of South Bend, Ind., who was slated to finish fourth in South Carolina, campaigned in Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday, one of the states holding a primary on Tuesday.\\n\\nHe congratulated Biden on his victory, but looked ahead, saying, I am proud of the votes we've earned and I'm determined to earn every vote on the road ahead.\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, another candidate who fared poorly in South Carolina, was courting voters in a state with a large prize of delegates on Super Tuesday — Texas.\\n\\nAt her Houston rally she argued she was a better candidate than Sanders, who she said had some good policy ideas, but can't get things done.\\n\\nShe also took aim at Biden, saying about the political moment: This crisis demands more than a former vice president who is eager to cut deals with Republicans.\\n\\nMcAuliffe urged several Democrats in the race to consider dropping out before Super Tuesday. Tom Steyer, the billionaire entrepreneur who spent over $23 million on advertising in South Carolina, ended his bid after finishing third there.\\n\\nI said if I didn't see a path to winning, that I'd suspend my campaign, Steyer told supporters, and honestly, I can't see a path where I can win the presidency.\\n\\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was trailing in sixth place on Saturday night.\\n\\nNPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, Brian Naylor, and Elena Moore contributed to this report"}
{"original": "DEA Rejects Attempt To Loosen Federal Restrictions On Marijuana\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Obama administration has denied a bid by two Democratic governors to reconsider how it treats marijuana under federal drug control laws, keeping the drug for now, at least, in the most restrictive category for U.S. law enforcement purposes.\\n\\nDrug Enforcement Administration chief Chuck Rosenberg says the decision is rooted in science. Rosenberg gave enormous weight to conclusions by the Food and Drug Administration that marijuana has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and by some measures, it remains highly vulnerable to abuse as the most commonly used illicit drug across the nation.\\n\\nThis decision isn't based on danger. This decision is based on whether marijuana, as determined by the FDA, is a safe and effective medicine, he said, and it's not.\\n\\nMarijuana is considered a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD, while other, highly addictive substances including oxycodone and methamphetamine are regulated differently under Schedule II of the law. But marijuana's designation has nothing to do with danger, Rosenberg said.\\n\\nIn a letter to the petitioners, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and New Mexico nurse practitioner Bryan Krumm, Rosenberg said doctors are responsible for treating patients, but the FDA makes decisions about drug safety: Simply put, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs is a highly specialized endeavor.\\n\\nTom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, said in a statement that the decision was disappointing.\\n\\nPresident Obama always said he would let science — and not ideology — dictate policy, but in this case his administration is upholding a failed drug war approach instead of looking at real, existing evidence that marijuana has medical value, he wrote.\\n\\nMost Americans support legalization, Angell wrote, and the federal government should at a minimum leave regulatory decisions to the states.\\n\\nDrug enforcers insist they are supportive of efforts to advance scientific research on marijuana. The DEA said it has never denied an application from a researcher to use lawfully produced marijuana in a rigorous medical study, and Rosenberg pointed out that research continues on a variety of subjects, including the effects of smoking marijuana in human subjects.\\n\\nA spokesman for the FDA said the agency shares an interest in developing therapies from marijuana and its components and have taken aggressive, coordinated action to do so.\\n\\nThe FDA added that well-controlled clinical trials represent the most appropriate way to advance scientific understanding and that the drug approval process gives the agency the important ability to determine whether a product meets the FDA criteria for safety and effectiveness.\\n\\nIn December 2015, federal authorities said, they made it easier for researchers conducting clinical trials on cannabidiol, a component of marijuana. Some scientists are studying whether the substance can help treat childhood epilepsy. That would be a wonderful and welcome development, the DEA letter said, but we insist that CBD research, or any research, be sound, scientific and rigorous before a product can be authorized for medical use.\\n\\nWhat's more, federal authorities said, they are increasing the amount of marijuana available for legitimate research. They said they will open up new avenues for more people and institutions to manufacture marijuana for scientific purposes. Currently, the University of Mississippi is the only such site in the U.S.\\n\\nAs long as folks abide by the rules, and we're going to regulate that, we want to expand the availability, the variety, the type of marijuana available to legitimate researchers, Rosenberg said. If our understanding of the science changes, that could very well drive a new decision.\\n\\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia allow some form of medical marijuana use, but the federal government has not taken that step despite prodding from federal lawmakers. Last month, the Democratic National Committee endorsed the idea of loosening federal restrictions on marijuana and providing a reasoned platform for future legalization in its platform.\\n\\nFor now, there remain two ways to change the federal government's classification of marijuana: for a host of federal agencies including the DEA and FDA to sign off; or for Congress to pass a law, and for the president to sign it."}

Analysts have been parsing reports of the congress for signs of new policies, and this is the first indication of Kim's position towards a new U.S. administration.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has promised principled diplomacy with North Korea, implying a break with President Donald Trump's high-stakes summits with Kim Jong Un. He has also indicated he will work more closely with U.S. allies South Korea and Japan.\\n\\nAt the congress, Kim called for the improvement of the country's nuclear arsenal to include solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles that can be launched from land and sea, and accurately hit targets at a range of up to 9,320 miles, putting the U.S. mainland in reach.\\n\\nHe also ordered the development of miniaturized nuclear weapons, tactical nukes, military surveillance satellites and hypersonic aircraft.\\n\\nKim reaffirmed that North Korea would not use its nuclear arsenal in a preemptive strike.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of his second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February 2019, Kim appeared to give up hope of reaching a denuclearization deal with the U.S., and resolved to continue building up nuclear and conventional weapons while diplomacy remained stalemated.\\n\\nLast year, Kim pledged to unveil a new strategic weapon, and in October, North Korea revealed what appeared to be a new and upgraded intercontinental ballistic missile, bigger than one already thought to be capable of hitting the continental U.S.\\n\\nWhile Kim has said he no longer feels bound by his self-imposed moratorium on testing strategic weapons, including nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Pyongyang has not tested either since the last intercontinental ballistic missile launch in 2017. The tests triggered stringent U.N. sanctions.\\n\\nNorth Korea did continue last year, though, to test shorter range ballistic missiles capable of hitting targets in South Korea, including bases where the U.S. has some 28,500 troops. President Trump appeared unperturbed by the tests, as they were not capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.\\n\\nKim began the party conference this week, the last since 2016, by bluntly admitting that his last five-year economic plan had ended in failure, due to both external factors — such as international sanctions and the coronavirus — but also due to internal reasons, such as government mismanagement of the economy.\\n\\nThe KCNA report said the congress blamed officials for botching implementation of the party's economic plans and failing to actively introduce reality-friendly and people-friendly methods in the ruling party's work.\\n\\nThe report also touted Kim's summitry with Trump as a diplomatic achievement.\\n\\nOver the past five years, it claimed, the ruling party's work effected a dramatic change in the balance of power between Pyongyang and Washington, demonstrating the dignity and prestige of our state."}
{"original": "The Billion Dollar Cost Of Child Marriage\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephanie Sinclair/ Too Young to Wed Stephanie Sinclair/ Too Young to Wed\\n\\nAdvocates for ending child marriage are trying a new tactic: Show governments just how much the practice is hurting their own bottom line.\\n\\nThat's the goal of a new report by the World Bank and the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), a global research and advocacy group. The report analyzes the impact of child marriage on the national budgets and economic growth of 25 countries where at least one in three women marry before age 18. Its conclusion: By 2030 child marriage will cost developing countries billions of dollars in health-care and education costs as well as lost earnings potential.\\n\\nSuzanne Petroni, one the report's co-authors and a senior director at ICRW charged with expanding the evidence base on child marriage, is hoping the data will be a wake-up call for governments. Until now, Petroni says, research on child marriage has mainly focused on determining its prevalence, causes and costs to women at the individual or family level.\\n\\nThis prior research has helped bring global attention to the issue and even galvanized some political will to address it. But only up to a point: The investments that are needed to end the practice have not been forthcoming, says Petroni. So if we could document and show finance ministers, policy makers, donors and communities that child marriage has a cost to their bottom line budgets, we may finally be able to spur investments in solutions.\\n\\nThe study finds one of the biggest bites to a country's budget results from the link between child marriage and population growth. The report estimates that a girl marrying at 13 will have an average of 26 percent more children over her lifetime than if she were married at 18 or older. And across the countries studied, ending child marriage would reduce total fertility rates by an average of 11 percent. Take Niger, where more than three-fourths of women are married before age 18 — the highest proportion in the world. The study finds that ending child marriage would slow population growth by 5 percent by 2030.\\n\\nThe additional children that are being born as a result of child marriage drive up government spending. For instance, in 18 countries analyzed, the study found that curbing this growth would save as much as $17 billion a year from the education budget.\\n\\nOf course, in theory rising births can be a boon to a country if the short term cost are more than offset by the benefits of a gaining a larger workforce down the line. But Petroni says that only works if the country provides its children with enough education to grow into economically productive adults. And that's not generally the case in countries with high rates of child marriage.\\n\\nChild marriage for the most part takes place in situations of poverty, she says. And the offspring of child brides tend to be not just more children, but also children who less healthy, less educated and less able to contribute economically to their countries.\\n\\nThe study finds that child marriage can also damage a country's overall economy because of the devastating impact that under-age marriage has on a girl's educational prospects, which, in turn determine her earning power. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg conundrum when it comes to quantifying the connection between child marriage and high school dropout rates, notes Petroni. That's because in places where child marriage is common, it's also often the case that girls don't have easy access to schools. So it can be hard to determine whether a girl drops out because she's been married off, or whether she's married off because she's no longer attending school.\\n\\nEither way, however, studies indicate that child marriage and lack of education are closely entwined. And this new report estimates that as a result, child marriage reduces the earnings in adulthood for women by an average of 9 percent. In Nigeria alone that amounts to $7.6 billion annually in lost earnings and productivity.\\n\\nOn the upside, the link between underage marriage and education also suggests a powerful tool for curbing the practice: Get more girls into high school. In those 15 countries analyzed in greatest depth, the study estimates that every year of secondary education reduces a girl's likelihood of marrying as a child from four to 10 percentage points depending on the country.\\n\\nOne of the biggest messages from this study is just how important education is, says Petroni.

President Biden is expected to try to repair U.S. relations with the Palestinians.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nU.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinians changed dramatically under the Trump administration in favor of Israel. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a vocal ally of Donald Trump. We're joined now by NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem to talk about how the inauguration of President Joe Biden is being received there.\\n\\nHi, Daniel.\\n\\nDANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: So some optimism was expressed today from the Palestinian leadership. Tell us about what they said.\\n\\nESTRIN: Yeah. Palestinians are eager to turn a new page here because Trump has snubbed the Palestinian leadership repeatedly. The administration closed down the Palestinian envoy's office in Washington. The Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy here to Jerusalem - where I am - and sided with Israel's claims to the city. Palestinians also have claims in Jerusalem. So then, the Palestinians cut ties with Trump. And then, Trump stopped giving humanitarian aid to Palestinians. So there was just a lot of bad blood between them.\\n\\nAnd Biden has pledged to reverse a lot of what Trump did. He says he will restore humanitarian aid to Palestinians. He will oppose Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. Trump actually supported Israeli claims to territory there. So now, there are some Palestinians who are disappointed that the Biden team says they will not be moving the embassy out of Jerusalem. But the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, congratulated Biden today. And he's expecting Biden to be more favorable to the Palestinians.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: And what have Israeli leaders been saying today?\\n\\nESTRIN: Well, Netanyahu congratulated Biden. But in general, Israeli officials are doing this kind of two-step. They are, on the one hand, thanking Trump, calling him the best friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. And then they're just cautiously walking this balance beam. They're trying to position themselves to be on Biden's good side and praising Biden as a longtime friend of Israel. In the same breath, though, they are voicing concern - very clear concern - about what Biden's policies will be on Iran.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: So let's talk about that. I mean, the Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. What's Israel looking for from the Biden administration on this?\\n\\nESTRIN: Israelis really just want to be at the table. They want to be at the table with the U.S. from the get-go because Biden has indicated he wants to enter some kind of deal again with Iran to curb its nuclear enrichment in exchange for lifting sanctions. Israel opposes making a deal with Iran and says that would just strengthen a regime that seeks to dominate the region and arm Israel's enemies. So already, the Israelis are publicly at odds with President Biden, you know, on Day 1. And the incoming secretary of state - or Biden's pick for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, is trying to reassure Israel it will be consulted on Iran policy.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: So what are the early signs that people in the region are looking for to show how relations between the new administration and Israel and the Palestinians might go, what direction it might take?\\n\\nESTRIN: Well, there are two big events that we should look at. First of all, the Palestinians promise that they're going to hold elections for the first time in 16 years. And they want to clean up their divided leadership, their political mess, rehabilitate themselves, have a fresh start with Biden in office. And then, Israeli elections are coming up in March. Prime Minister Netanyahu is running again. He doesn't have Trump in the White House to help him. In general, Israelis and Palestinians are just on the lookout now to see what Trump-era policies Biden will change.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nESTRIN: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Assessing The Trump Administration's New Visa Policy For Pregnant Women\\n\\nThe Trump administration has moved to block visas for pregnant women to halt birth tourism. NPR's Scott Simon speaks to Ur Jaddou, director of the watchdog group DHS Watch, about the new ban.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nWomen who are pregnant may soon find it harder to visit the United States. The State Department is expanding the power of consular officers. They can now deny a pregnant woman a tourist visa if she is suspected of travelling to the U.S. to gain citizenship for her child. The Trump administration believes this new rule, which went into effect Friday, will limit what they call birth tourism. But opponents of the rule say a consular officer's decision will be solely based on a woman's appearance.\\n\\nUr Jaddou, director of Department of Homeland Security Watch for America's Voice, joins us. Thank you for being with us.\\n\\nUR JADDOU: Thank you for inviting me.\\n\\nSIMON: What's your reaction to this rule?\\n\\nJADDOU: Well, when you look at the new language in the regulation that went into effect just Friday, it very specifically says that if a consular officer has reason to believe the woman will give birth during her stay in the United States, now she has a presumption to overcome that she is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child. She now has a higher burden than any other applicant who's trying to come to the United States to visit Disney World, for a business trip, for a conference or, for that matter, to seek specialized medical care to maybe save her child's life and maybe that of her own.\\n\\nSIMON: What's - I think you've outlined some of it, but what are your concerns about how this rule might be used, particularly given the administration policies we've seen over the past couple of years?\\n\\nJADDOU: Well, the most obvious concern is, what does reason to believe will give birth during her stay in the United States actually mean? When a consular officer is given that discretion to determine that, does that mean a woman that might have a belly bump or perhaps might have a little extra weight - is she all of a sudden faced with questions about her reproductive cycle?\\n\\nAs you can see, the questions start becoming quite absurd. However, the actual language is drafted in a way that's even broader and could potentially lead to even more absurd results because visitor visas are often granted for up to 10 years. And in that case, a consular officer could have reason to believe that even a non-pregnant woman, just because she is of childbearing age, could one day use that visa to give birth in the United States.\\n\\nSIMON: To the best of your knowledge, is this a policy that's also extended to Department of Homeland Security officers?\\n\\nJADDOU: So that's what's so interesting about this. This is a State Department regulation, which means it will apply to anybody that needs a visa to travel to the United States. It will not apply to 39 countries who participate in a program called the Visa Waiver Program. Foreign nationals from these countries do not need to go to a consulate and obtain a visa to travel to the United States. So it won't apply to them. And those countries are generally the Western, more industrialized nation. But this - the new rule applies to everybody else. So as you can see, it's also having some racial disparities, which is also extremely concerning for many of us.\\n\\nSIMON: Ur Jaddou, director of Department of Homeland Security Watch for America's Voice. Thank you so much for being with us.\\n\\nJADDOU: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Progressives Gear Up For Broad New Push On Climate Action\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Vogel/AP Richard Vogel/AP\\n\\nA coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as President-elect Joe Biden is days away from taking office with Democrats set to control both the House and the Senate.\\n\\nThe group, the Green New Deal Network, plans to invest in partner organizations in 20 key states to mobilize grassroots power to pressure elected officials to support their goals; introduce Green New Deal-related legislation at the state and local level, spearhead federal legislation that would implement parts of the Green New Deal agenda, and to pressure the incoming Biden administration to enact a series of executive actions related to climate, jobs and justice.\\n\\nEvery day [SEIU members] confront the crisis of climate, as well as environmental racism and economic inequality, so the Green New Deal is not something that is abstract to them, said Rocio Sáenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. For our members the Green New Deal means clear air, clean water, safe communities, good jobs and a growing economy. So this, for us, is why we are part of this network. What we see, especially now more than ever, is that we cannot think about these issues in siloes.\\n\\nNamed for the sweeping proposal for cutting U.S. contributions to climate change over the next decade, the coalition has already raised more than $20 million, organizers say.\\n\\nIntroduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the Green New Deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. The plan drew significant attention from President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast Democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. The Green New Deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. Supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.\\n\\nThe groups coming together to back it now include the Center for Popular Democracy, Climate Justice Alliance, Grassroots Global Justice, Greenpeace, Indigenous Environmental Network, Indivisible, the Movement for Black Lives, MoveOn, People's Action, Right to the City, Service Employees International Union, the Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, US Climate Action Network and the Working Families Party.\\n\\nLeaders of the coalition say they plan to put the majority of their resources into a coordinated campaign stitched-together across key states, that rely on local activists and organizers.\\n\\nWe have a shot to create millions of green jobs, to transform the way our economy works so it actually helps working people, said Kaniela Ing, the climate justice campaign director for People's Action. Change doesn't happen from the top down. You can't just hire a bunch of experts and lobbyists if you want something to be lasting. We're not just lobbying D.C., we're actually lobbying on the ground in all 50 states.\\n\\nThey are also applying pressure at the federal level. The Green New Deal Network has already written a letter to President-elect Biden and his transition team, arguing that there is a dire need for action beyond legislation.\\n\\nMassive federal investment is past due and a down payment on a regenerative future is urgently needed, the coalition wrote, calling on the incoming Biden administration to do everything within its authority to ensure healthy communities, a more just economy and a livable planet.\\n\\nThe letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that Biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from Indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities.\\n\\nFor his part, Biden has announced his own climate change agenda that stops short of endorsing the Green New Deal. It includes trillions of dollars in spending on green initiatives and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050. Late last year, he named key members of his climate change team, including former Obama-era EPA director Gina McCarthy to lead a new White House Office of Climate policy and New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. Haaland is a congressional co-sponsor of the Green New Deal.\\n\\nWe're going to call on President-elect Biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice, said Saenz. We know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way.\\n\\nSome compared the scope of the effort to that of the Health Care for America Now coalition, the vast, progressive coalition that was crucial to the Affordable Care Act cause.\\n\\nThat work was critical to convincing the Obama administration that there was a real path to get the legislation through, said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of of the Working Families Party. So we plan on using that strategy. Sometimes, the best way to influence a president is indirectly by doing the work on the ground and shoring up members of Congress to inspire in the administration the belief that there actually is a legislative path.\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of that work, said Ing, is helping to build capacity on the ground in a state-by-state level.\\n\\nPeople in their communities know their communities best, Ing said. We are all the expert of our own experiences, just kind of recognizing that and supporting that by not just bringing money into a state, but creating a way where people can come together cooperatively, build their own local coalitions and then we can support that.\\n\\nLindsay Harper, the national coordinator for Arm in Arm, a group organizing to end the climate crisis through fighting for racial and economic justice, said that she views this as an opportunity to focus on local fights that have real, true national and international implications.\\n\\nI'm really excited about bringing people's faces and experiences into a conversation where folks from the south, Black folks, Black women, people of color and in some low wealth communities have not been at the table. Harper said. They have not been a part of the fabric. They have not been in an opportunity to lead and to contribute. I think that Georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward.\\n\\nThe coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as Waxman-Markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The bill, colloquially named for then-Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Ed Markey, then a representative, passed the House in 2009 and died in the Senate. Leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an insider play and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat.\\n\\nWhen the far-right movement built a ground swell and pushed back on things like Waxman-Markey, there was no countervailing movement force to challenge that, said Mitchell. We plan on having a 50-state strategy that is rooted outside, in order to shore up Congress because we know that every single member is going to need to be held accountable.\\n\\nThe new group's leaders also say they will not shy away from backing primary challenges to sitting lawmakers.\\n\\nTo me and to us, this is a moral imperative, said Mitchell. We don't have another shot at this. So if the science, if the wildfires in California, if the increased intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes... if all of this isn't enough for you, you don't deserve to be in office."}
{"original": "Vindman, Sondland Removed As Trump Purges Impeachment Witnesses\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer and Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Drew Angerer and Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 3:31 p.m. ET Saturday\\n\\nPresident Trump, who has expressed anger about officials who testified in his impeachment inquiry, fired two of them on Friday.\\n\\nTrump recalled European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland and ended the White House National Security Council assignment of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\\n\\nIn tweets Saturday, Trump addressed Vindman's firing, saying, I don't know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don't believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly ... was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, 'OUT'.\\n\\nVindman's attorney, David Pressman, called Trump's claims about Vindman obviously false, adding that they conflict with the clear personnel record and the entirety of the impeachment record of which the President is well aware. While the most powerful man in the world continues his campaign of intimidation, while too many entrusted with political office continue to remain silent, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman continues his service to our country as a decorated, active duty member of our military.\\n\\nThe swift actions Friday — coming only two days after Trump's acquittal — incensed his critics. President Trump is exacting his retribution, removing those who complied with subpoenas, came forward, and testified about his misconduct, Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the House impeachment inquiry, said on Twitter Friday night.\\n\\nThis is as clear a case of retribution as I've seen during my 27 years in the Senate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.\\n\\nVindman, the Ukraine expert at the National Security Council who became a star witness in the House impeachment hearings on President Trump's dealings with the country, was escorted out of the White House on Friday, his lawyer said, adding Trump had decided to exact revenge.\\n\\nSondland, a Trump campaign donor who has served as United States ambassador to the European Union, said in a statement Friday that he was advised today that the President intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union.\\n\\nI am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union, Sondland wrote. I am proud of our accomplishments. Our work here has been the highlight of my career.\\n\\nVindman's twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also fired from the National Security Council on Friday, Pressman said.\\n\\nThe Vindman brothers have been reassigned to the Department of the Army, a department spokesperson confirmed. The department would not provide further information.\\n\\nThe National Security Council declined comment on Vindman's departure.\\n\\nEarlier Friday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether Vindman would be leaving. I'm not happy with him. You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not. They'll make that decision. You'll be hearing, Trump said.\\n\\nVindman, who immigrated from Ukraine as a child and is a decorated Iraq war veteran, was part of a group of officials who listened as Trump make his July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He reported the call to NSC lawyers and said he was concerned that Trump had pressed Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival.\\n\\nFrankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear about how Ukrainian policy could play out, was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security, Vindman testified.\\n\\nVindman had testified that his assignment at the White House was scheduled end in July and that he would return to the Army afterward.\\n\\nSondland had worked on Ukraine policy with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. He dealt directly with Zelenskiy and said Trump was looking for an investigation in exchange for an Oval Office meeting. Sondland testified that everyone was in the loop about what was going on.\\n\\nBut he also said Trump told him: I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelenskiy to do the right thing — words that Trump and his allies used to try to deflate Democrats' impeachment arguments.\\n\\nSondland and Vindman join a long list of other witnesses in the Trump impeachment investigation who have moved on from their jobs. Former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovich has retired from the foreign service. William Taylor, who had replaced Yovanovich in Ukraine after Trump recalled her, left in early January. Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, resigned as the impeachment process was unfolding. Jennifer Williams, a career foreign service officer who was assigned to Vice President Mike Pence's office, recently left for a new position. And Tim Morrison, Vindman's boss at the NSC, left after he testified.\\n\\nHere's the full statement from Alexander Vindman's lawyer David Pressman Friday:\\n\\nToday, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President. He does so having spoken publicly once, and only pursuant to a subpoena from the United States Congress. There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House. LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful. During his decades of service to this country, LTC Alexander Vindman has served quietly but dutifully, and he has served with honor. He came into the public eye only when subpoenaed to testify before Congress, and he did what the law demanded. In recent months, many entrusted with power in our political system have cowered out of fear. And, yet, a handful of men and women, not endowed with prestige or power, but equipped only with a sense of right borne out of years of quiet service to their country made different choices. They courageously chose to honor their duty with integrity, to trust the truth, and to put their faith in country ahead of fear. And they have paid a price. The truth has cost LTC Alexander Vindman his job, his career, and his privacy. He did what any member of our military is charged with doing every day: he followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country, even when doing so was fraught with danger and personal peril. And for that, the most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge. LTC Alexander Vindman leaves the White House today. But we must not accept the departure of truth, duty, and loyalty that he represents. In this country right matters, and so does truth. Truth is not partisan. If we allow truthful voices to be silenced, if we ignore their warnings, eventually there will be no one left to warn us.\\n\\nNPR's Tom Bowman, Michele Keleman, Claudia Grisales and James Doubek contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Trump Tweets He's The Subject Of A 'Witch Hunt'\\n\\nOn Twitter, President Trump responds to reports he's under FBI investigation for possible obstruction of justice. While some say his tweets confirm a probe, he could be reacting to press accounts.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump is on his way to Miami, where he plans to announce changes to U.S. policy toward Cuba. But before leaving, the president of the United States fired up Twitter, responding to reports he's under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. Not for the first time, he referred to it as a witch hunt. NPR's Scott Horsley is in our studios. Hi, Scott.\\n\\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK, so let's just remember The Washington Post reported that the president is under investigation by the special counsel for the possibility of obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation. How's he responding?\\n\\nHORSLEY: Angrily, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK.\\n\\nHORSLEY: The tweets resumed this morning with the president saying after seven months of investigations and committee hearings about my, quote, unquote, collusion with the Russians, nobody's been able to show any proof. Sad.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK.\\n\\nHORSLEY: And he went on to say despite the phony witch hunt going on in America, the economic and jobs numbers are great. And then finally, he tweeted, I'm being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Witch hunt. Now, some news outlets have taken that last tweet as confirmation from the president himself that, in fact, he is under investigation.\\n\\nBut, Steve, I'm not sure I would read it that way. Based on what we know about this president's Twitter habits I think it's more likely that Trump is simply reacting to the press accounts of the investigation, not actually confirming them.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I'm being - I'm just trying to unpack this. I'm being investigated, he says, for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Who would that be?\\n\\nHORSLEY: He seems to be referring to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who drafted that memo, you'll recall, which spells out a rationale for dismissing James Comey, the former FBI director. Although that's not the rationale that Trump himself said actually explained the firing.\\n\\nINSKEEP: He said, I was already planning to do it before I got the memo. And the memo, which people have seen, doesn't explicitly call for Comey's firing.\\n\\nHORSLEY: And the memo was all about the way Comey dealt with the email investigation of Hillary Clinton last year. But it was Rosenstein who later appointed Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russia's election meddling and any possible ties to the Trump campaign.\\n\\nNow, ironically, we had one of those only-in-Washington episodes yesterday when both Rosenstein and Trump were face to face at the Supreme Court building. They both happened to be there for the formal investiture ceremony for Neil Gorsuch, the new...\\n\\nINSKEEP: New Supreme Court justice.\\n\\nHORSLEY: ...Supreme Court justice nominated by President Trump. I happened to be there for that ceremony. I didn't see any interaction between Trump and Rosenstein. But last night Rosenstein issued this rather unusual statement saying Americans should be skeptical about news accounts of an investigation that are based on anonymous allegations. And he said, the Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.\\n\\nINSKEEP: The Department of Justice is so determined ordinarily not to comment on ongoing investigations that even putting out a statement saying news accounts may be wrong or not sounds like a comment, actually.\\n\\nHORSLEY: It's a - it was a very unusual statement from the deputy attorney general.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And something that is very much in line with what the White House says, although it was more politely phrased, perhaps, than the president would do. Like, don't believe the leakers essentially is what he's suggesting.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Rosenstein did not use the term fake news, but...\\n\\nINSKEEP: No. No. And he didn't say don't believe them, just might not be true, approach it with caution. Any idea why Rosenstein would take that unusual step?\\n\\nHORSLEY: No. I don't know what explains this statement.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK. And do you have any idea what is driving the president's messaging here, which seems very much at odds with, I don't know, a day ago or so when people were calling for bipartisan unity after a shooting?\\n\\nHORSLEY: People including the president himself. We've seen a real sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde display from the White House this week. After that tragic shooting at the congressional baseball practice on Wednesday the president went on television, made a somber, I think, well-received address where he called for unity, said all the - for all of our partisan squabbles we're stronger when we act together.\\n\\nHe made similar comments yesterday which really fit the sort of standard presidential playbook. But in between that we've also had these very partisan, Trumpian (ph) tweets. And he makes no apologies for that. He says, the fake news hates it when I use social media, but it's turned out to be very powerful.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Scott, thanks very much.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Good to be with you, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Really appreciate it.

{"original": "When Integrating A School, Does It Matter If You Use Class Instead Of Race?\\n\\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\\n\\nStronger Together is not the name of the latest social-media fitness app. It's a grant proposed in President Obama's new budget, reviving an idea that hasn't gotten much policy attention in decades: diversity in public schools. If the request is approved, $120 million will go to school districts for programs intended to make their schools more diverse.\\n\\nAs a new pair of reports from the progressive Century Foundation shows, integration policies have seen a resurgence: In 2007, 40 districts pursued integration. Today that number has more than doubled, to 83, plus nine charter schools or networks. That adds up to a total of 4 million students in classrooms that are more diverse than they'd otherwise be.\\n\\nThis new wave of integration has come with one big difference that sets it apart from the busing battles of the past. These programs rely on family income, not race, as the driver.\\n\\nTo be clear, there's evidence that socially as well as racially integrated schools benefit all students. When a school reaches a stable level of about 30 percent middle-class students, the lower-income students achieve at higher levels and the privileged students do no worse, says Halley Potter, the author of one of the Century Foundation reports. Similarly, the racial achievement gap shrinks in schools that have less than a supermajority of 60 percent of any one race.\\n\\nBut the real case for diverse schools is a lot bigger than test scores, says Amy Stuart Wells, who teaches at Teachers College, Columbia University, and is the author of the second report. The qualitative and quantitative evidence is powerful enough to say, 'We should do this.' \\n\\nIt's worth pointing out that because of the legacy of discrimination and institutionalized segregation in the United States, in most communities mixing up students by class also means mixing them up by race.\\n\\nDiversification by socioeconomic status also means by race, says Mercedes Ebanks, an associate professor in the school of education at Howard University. The movement towards socioeconomic integration will lead to racial integration and educational equality.\\n\\nStill, some experts question whether socioeconomic integration really provides the same benefits as ethnic and cultural integration. There's not much empirical research on socioeconomic diversity per se and its benefits, says Katherine Phillips, a professor at the Columbia Business School.\\n\\nPhillips' own research, along with that of many others, focuses on the cognitive benefits of encounters with ethnic and racial difference. In a class discussion or on a problem-solving team, bringing together different viewpoints and experiences makes everyone think harder and provide better evidence for their opinions, she says.\\n\\nGiven the right atmosphere and guidance, which is a tall order, students in diverse classrooms can build cross-racial friendships, achieve greater levels of empathy and have a chance to work on all-important social and emotional skills.\\n\\nIntriguingly, other research suggests that implicit bias, our split-second judgments about people based on age, gender or the color of their skin, may cause cognitive impairments. That is: Racist ideas make people think poorly.\\n\\nThere are also economic arguments in favor of pursuing diversity. In the current U.S. Supreme Court case on affirmative action, nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 100 signed a brief testifying that it's an economic imperative in the global economy to hire diverse employees with cross-cultural skills that only diverse educational settings can provide."}

Instead, the rest of the family got caught up in Trump's immigration crackdown and ended up stuck in Lebanon for more than three years.\\n\\nIt wasn't until last November that the couple's daughter, son-in-law and four grandchildren were allowed in as refugees, crying and hugging during a tearful reunion at the airport gate in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nNow tens of thousands of families are hoping for similar reunions.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is expected to sign a flurry of executive orders when he takes office Wednesday, including an order rolling back the travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries.\\n\\nLegal battles over the travel ban raged for months until the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a slimmed-down version in 2018. At the same time, the Trump administration slashed the refugee admission cap. The policies left Haitham Dalati's family and thousands of others in limbo.\\n\\nThis is so horrible for us.

Really, it's another America.\\n\\nLegal experts say it should be relatively easy for Biden to end the travel ban on Day 1 of his administration, as he has promised. The policy was created by executive order, and it can be reversed in much the same way.\\n\\nBut immigrant advocates say the hard work is still ahead.\\n\\nIt's not just what they can do with the stroke of the pen, says Avideh Moussavian, the legislative director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of many nonprofit organizations that have fought what they deride as the Muslim ban.\\n\\nMoussavian says the Biden administration needs to assure immigrants that they will be treated fairly and give another chance to immigrants who have been rejected for visas and green cards under the travel ban.\\n\\nWhat we really think is crucial ... is to provide meaningful relief to people who have been directly impacted, Moussavian says.\\n\\nPeople like Pamela Raghebi, who has been separated from her husband for more than two years.\\n\\nI miss him and those arms holding me tight, making me laugh, Raghebi tells NPR in an interview.\\n\\nHer husband, Afshin Raghebi, was born in Iran and lived in the U.S. illegally for years. They met in Seattle, where she lives as a U.S. citizen. After they got married, he applied for a green card.\\n\\nUnder the rules, he had to fly to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for an interview at the U.S. Consulate. They knew that was risky because of the travel ban. But Pamela Raghebi says they were trying to do the right thing.\\n\\nNonetheless, her husband's application was denied. And now, he's stuck overseas.\\n\\nWe were devastated, Raghebi says. It's an insult. ... But we will keep trying.\\n\\nImmigration hard-liners say it would be a mistake to end the travel ban completely. They argue that the ban puts pressure on foreign governments affected by the travel ban — those in countries like Iran, Syria and Libya — to improve their own security vetting for travelers to the United States.\\n\\nThe burden should be on these countries to show their systems are adequate, says Jessica Vaughan at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower levels of immigration. And their situations haven't changed all that much.\\n\\nBut even some national security experts say banning all travelers from a country wasn't the answer. Instead, they say it fueled a narrative that the U.S. discriminates against Muslims.\\n\\nThese bans damaged our nation's reputation, says Elizabeth Neumann, a top counterterrorism official in the Trump administration until she resigned last year. She wrote an analysis of the travel and refugee bans for the National Immigration Forum.\\n\\nThey were an unnecessary distraction from the actual security enhancements that were needed, Neumann says.\\n\\nCritics of the travel ban say it has also had a big impact on public opinion in the United States\\n\\nThere's a polarization when it comes to people's views of Muslims, says Dalia Mogahed, research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, an organization that's focused on American Muslims.\\n\\nDuring the Trump administration, Mogahed says, Democrats have become less likely to hold negative views of Muslims, while Republicans have moved in the opposite direction. More than 75% of Republicans now associate Islam with violence, Mogahed says.\\n\\nMogahed says she used to hear frequently that Islamophobia isn't real or that it's not a big problem — even from self-described liberals. She says that rarely happens anymore.\\n\\nIslamophobia is not new. And it didn't start with Trump, Mogahed said in an interview. But what these kinds of policies have done is, it's ended the denial."}
{"original": "In Kenya, Reproductive Clinics Fear Trump Policy's Detrimental Effects\\n\\nPresident Trump's Mexico City policy will harm nonprofits providing healthcare for women. A USAID-funded clinic in Nairobi is afraid it will prevent it from helping Kenyan women in need of abortions.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump last week reinstated what's known as the Mexico City Policy or, to its critics, the global gag rule. It cuts off funds to any aid group that provides abortions overseas or even counsels women on abortion. And without that money, reproductive-health clinics in some of the poorest countries in the world may have to close. NPR's Eyder Peralta visited a clinic in Nairobi, Kenya.\\n\\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Just outside the Family Health Option Kenya building in Nairobi, there is a golden plaque. It says the headquarters for the reproductive-health organization was built with assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development - or USAID. As executive director Edward Marienga sees it, the funding has been a blessing and a curse because when Democrats enter the White House, they up funding. But when Republicans take power, they reinstate the Mexico City Policy. When George W. Bush took over after Bill Clinton, for example, the clinic was devastated.\\n\\nEDWARD MARIENGA: We closed a number of clinics, five out of - by that time, we were only nine.\\n\\nPERALTA: That's more than half their clinics. The most frustrating part, says Marienga, is that this all has to do with domestic American politics that Kenyans can do little about.\\n\\nMARIENGA: But, you see, sometimes, this continuous change - it's like playing a football match with people's lives.\\n\\nPERALTA: Critics say that there are two big problems with the policy. It's too broad. It cuts funding for organizations that simply try to educate women on abortion laws in their country. And, secondly, in many poor countries, U.S. aid is monumental. Moreen Majiwa of the Center for Reproductive Rights Kenya.\\n\\nMOREEN MAJIWA: Four percent of Kenya's GDP goes to health. A large part of that is donor-funded, and a large part of that is U.S.-funded.\\n\\nPERALTA: So sexual and reproductive health services become scarce, especially for poor women, says Majiwa. Back in 2011, a Stanford University study looked at how the Mexico City Policy affected African countries during the Bush administration. It found that as counseling services went away, abortions in some of those countries doubled.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING)\\n\\nALICE NYABOKE MMONYI: Come this side.\\n\\nPERALTA: Back at the clinic, I meet the head nurse, Alice Nyaboke Mmonyi. She takes me to the clinic's maternity ward. The clinic, she says, does pride itself on providing contraceptives and abortion counseling for women. But they also do much more. They offer HIV counselling. They test and treat STDs. And in a country with a high rate of maternal mortality, they offer a safe place to give birth. This month so far...\\n\\nMMONYI: Eighteen deliveries - normal delivery being 15 and cesarean section being three.\\n\\nPERALTA: All those services, she says, are in danger now because the clinic says it's impossible to comply with a policy that would interfere with medical conversations with patients. Downstairs, I am introduced to Chaila Maya, a patient at the clinic. She's 24, the mother of a 3-year-old girl. The clinic has been a lifeline for her. It's the place that taught her about sex and family planning.\\n\\nCHAILA MAYA: From where I comes from in the slum, actually, they don't talk about family planning.\\n\\nPERALTA: At all?\\n\\nMAYA: Not even, like, the simplest - like, you should use a condom. They believe it's, like, a taboo. They shouldn't do that.\\n\\nPERALTA: Every month now, Chaila comes to the clinic to receive free contraceptives. Public hospitals don't offer them. And the nearest other clinic that might is easily a two-hour bus ride away. Chaila says she doesn't know what she'll do if the clinic closes.\\n\\nMAYA: Me personally - first, I'll be broken down. Maybe you can try to find a way to talk to Trump. I don't know how you can do it.\\n\\nPERALTA: Maybe, she says, there's a way for President Trump to see how his actions affect the everyday lives of poor women an ocean away.

Raising black teenage girls as white parents can be even tougher. Aaron and Colleen Cook knew that when they adopted their twin daughters, Mya and Deanna.\\n\\nAs spring came around this year, the girls, who just turned 16, told their parents they wanted to get braided hair extensions. Their parents happily obliged, wanting Mya and Deanna to feel closer to their black heritage.\\n\\nBut when the girls got to school, they were asked to step out of class. Both were given several infractions for violating the dress code. Mystic Valley Regional Charter School, north of Boston, bans hair extensions in its dress code, deeming them distracting.\\n\\nWhen administrators asked the girls to remove their braids, Mya and Deanna refused.\\n\\nThe next day, Colleen and Aaron Cook came to the school where, they say, they were told the girls' hair needed to be fixed. The Cooks refused, telling administrators that there was nothing wrong with the hairstyle.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Cook family. Courtesy of the Cook family.\\n\\nAs punishment, the girls were removed from their extracurricular activities, barred from prom and threatened with suspension if they did not change their hair.\\n\\nAccording to Colleen Cook, administrators at Mystic Valley have routinely reprimanded black students for dress code violations involving hair.\\n\\nOther black girls have been pulled out of class, she says, lined up, asked if they had hair extensions and given detention if they did.\\n\\nColleen remembers when one student, who wore her hair in its natural texture, was taken out of class and told that she would need to relax, or chemically straighten, her hair before returning to school the next day.\\n\\nIn defense of their daughters, the Cooks brought in a yearbook to show school leaders the many white female students with hair extensions and dyed hair.\\n\\nBut, the Cooks say, the administration didn't see that those students were in violation of the dress code, stating those hair alterations weren't as obvious.\\n\\nNPR reached out to Mystic Valley Regional for an interview several times without a response.\\n\\nThe Cooks contacted the NAACP, Anti-Defamation League and ACLU to file a complaint against the school, calling the dress code discriminatory to students of color, particularly black females.\\n\\nAfter much pressure, the school suspended enforcement of the dress code until the end of the year.\\n\\nNoticing a trend\\n\\nIn recent years, black girls have been sent home for wearing dreads, head wraps and even wearing their hair naturally.\\n\\nIn schools across the country, black student suspension rates are higher than their peers'. In charter schools, kindergarten through eighth grade, those rates are even higher.\\n\\nHaving a dress code is one thing, but denying an education for it defies logic.\\n\\nIn fact, Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies, found that at the highest-suspending charter schools in the nation, the majority of students were black.\\n\\nThough databases for infractions vary from state to state, in a recent analysis, half of suspensions in charter schools were for minor nonviolent offenses, including dress code violations.\\n\\nSpecifically, Losen's research shows that in Massachusetts, the Cooks' home state, black students at charters lose 24 more days of instruction to suspension than do white students.\\n\\nHaving a dress code is one thing, but denying an education for it defies logic, says Losen.\\n\\nZero tolerance leads to high suspension rates\\n\\nDorinda J. Carter Andrews, assistant dean of equity outreach initiatives at Michigan State University, says that black females are more likely to receive harsher discipline than their white and Latina counterparts.\\n\\nHer research on zero tolerance policies and their outcomes shows that they enforce a marginalization of black girls in schools. Which can, in practice, criminalize their black identity.\\n\\nWhat does a headdress have to do with learning and success? asks Carter Andrews.\\n\\nShe finds it strange that hair would even be part of a dress code. It's not a choice, but an aspect of one's body. Which raises a question: Is a zero tolerance policy for hair — where students can be suspended without warning — less about a dress code and more about a racial code?\\n\\nWhat does a headdress have to do with learning and success?\\n\\nIn her research, Carter Andrews has found that this type of policing has a detrimental effect on black girls in schools and how their peers view them, further enforcing negative stereotypes.\\n\\nBlack girls are often seen as being loud or aggressive and are overly disciplined because of that stigma. Andrews finds that leads to low self-esteem and underperformance in school for these students.\\n\\nJamilia Blake, who looks at the adultification of black girls in schools, believes stereotypes of black adults are put on black children in schools, and black girls in particular.\\n\\nBlake sees strict dress codes as a way of targeting certain students without using racial language. By using certain restrictions on hairstyles and dress, school officials are enforcing the policing of black youth.\\n\\nToward the end of the school year, the Cook twins, Mya and Deanna, were allowed to participate in their extracurricular activities. That was after much upset from friends and supporters and a word of warning from the Massachusetts attorney general to school leaders at Mystic Valley Regional Charter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Cooks continue to advocate for their daughters as the dress code fight goes on. The school hasn't made any plans, publicly, to change the regulations around hair.\\n\\nColleen Cook wants people to know that they're fighting not just for their daughters but for the other black girls in the school who have felt victimized.\\n\\nWhen our daughters walk with us, they have our white privilege. When they're not with us, they're black children.\\n\\nMystic Valley has put out a statement in defense of its dress code policy, stating that the restrictions on hair extensions exist so that the school can promote equity. Hair extensions — it reads — can be expensive.\\n\\nThe Cooks believe this experience has helped them realize the world their daughters have to face.\\n\\nWhen our daughters walk with us, they have our white privilege. When they're not with us, they're black children, says Aaron Cook.\\n\\nColleen agrees, adding, I feel like the school is pushing us to raise them as white children, but that's not who they are or who they're going to be.\\n\\nThe Cooks value their children's black heritage and want them to be proud of themselves at home and at school. They'll continue to fight to make that happen."}
{"original": "N.M. Governor Pulls National Guard From Border, Citing A 'Charade' At Federal Level\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Lee/AP Morgan Lee/AP\\n\\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has ordered the majority of National Guard troops deployed at her state's Southern border to withdraw, condemning what she called a charade of border fear-mongering by President Trump, who has warned of an immigration emergency in the region.\\n\\nI reject the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the Southern border, Lujan Grisham said, adding that the area has some of the safest communities in the country.\\n\\nThe governor's order covers most of New Mexico's deployed troops, along with Guard members who have traveled from Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Wisconsin. In all, 118 National Guard troops have been deployed in New Mexico, the governor's office said.\\n\\nLujan Grisham ordered the withdrawal just before Trump delivered his State of the Union address, in which he railed against illegal immigration and labeled a group of mainly Central American migrants as illegal immigrants — despite the fact that most of them are traveling with legal humanitarian visas.\\n\\nThere had been speculation that Trump might use the State of the Union to declare a national emergency at the border, as a legal basis for going ahead with building his long-promised wall. The president did not mention that possibility during Tuesday night's speech.\\n\\nLujan Grisham rejected the idea that a national emergency exists along her state's border with Mexico. But she also said some troops will remain in southwestern New Mexico, saying they're needed to fulfill a humanitarian mission in Hidalgo County and neighboring counties.\\n\\nThose counties have seen large groups of families, women and children crossing over the border in the remote Antelope Wells area in recent months, the governor's office said.\\n\\nThe Antelope Wells port of entry is where 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, a migrant from Guatemala, went through an initial screening before dying of dehydration and shock in December. She was one of two migrant children who died in separate incidents in New Mexico that month, after being taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In the other case, Felipe Gomez Alonso, 8, died after being diagnosed with a cold and a fever.\\n\\nHidalgo County and its neighbors are asking for help as migrants and asylum-seekers continue to appear at their doorstep, Lujan Grisham said Tuesday.\\n\\nThe state's National Guard will now decide whether a larger presence is needed to support those counties. In addition, the state police will send six officers to bolster operations in Hidalgo County — a move that the governor's office says was requested by the county manager.\\n\\nNew Mexico sent National Guard troops to the border last April in an order from then-Gov. Susana Martinez that followed a White House proclamation. At least five states, including two led by Republicans, rejected the president's call to send troops, with Maryland's Gov. Larry Hogan saying his state wanted nothing to do with the Trump administration policy of separating families at the border.\\n\\nTrump began ordering Marines and other active-duty personnel to the border last fall. Earlier this week, he ordered an additional 3,750 troops to the Southern border, warning of Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country.\\n\\nThe active-duty service members are being sent to the area to perform duties such as hanging barbed wire and giving logistical support to Customs and Border Protection agents.\\n\\nIn addition to Lujan Grisham, other leaders along the border have said their communities are safe — and that there is no security emergency involving migrants. In its fact check of Trump's State of the Union speech, NPR's John Burnett and Carrie Kahn relayed these assessments:\\n\\nAs for the 'state of our Southern border,' mayors along the Southwest border consistently say that their communities are among the safest in the nation. McAllen, Texas, Mayor Jim Darling asserted that his city is the third safest in Texas, according to FBI crime statistics, and seventh safest in the nation. 'Send social workers to process the asylum-seekers, not soldiers,' Darling said in a recent call with reporters. Eddie Trevino, Cameron County judge in Brownsville, added, 'It is a misconception that the border is insecure. There is no Central American invasion. This is a manufactured crisis.'"}
{"original": "From Fracking Bans To Paid Sick Leave: How States Are Overruling Local Laws\\n\\nPR Watch's Lisa Graves says that states can overrule local laws, and that legislatures are increasingly using preemption to stop things like minimum wage increases and protections for LGBT people.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The North Carolina state legislature sparked a national controversy recently when it acted to overturn a law passed by the City Council in Charlotte, N.C. that banned discrimination against LGBTQ people. Our guest, Lisa Graves, says this move by the North Carolina Legislature is part of an increasingly common pattern in which towns and cities pass laws ranging from bans on fracking to increasing the minimum wage only to have their state legislature pass a law that overrules the local ordinance.\\n\\nLisa Graves is executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy. The center has been tracking this new trend of preemption laws on their online news journal, PR Watch. The center describes itself as a watchdog organization that conducts in-depth investigations into corruption and the undue influence of corporations on media and democracy.\\n\\nLisa Graves previously worked as deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department and as chief counsel for nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee. She spoke with Fresh Air contributor Dave Davies.\\n\\nDAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Lisa Graves, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's begin with North Carolina, where there was a huge controversy about a local ordinance there that was the subject of state action - began in Charlotte. What happened?\\n\\nLISA GRAVES: In February, in Charlotte the City Council passed a measure to provide protections for members of the LGBTQ community. And the minute the City Council passed that measure, the governor and the Legislature basically said that were going to block it, or in other words, preempt it. A month later, on March 22, the state Legislature entered into a special session.\\n\\nThere was no hurricane or emergency, but they acted with a tremendous speed to call a special session in order to preempt that measure. And the lawmakers who were going to be considering that preemption bill received only about five minutes to look at the bill before they had to vote on it in committee. And the public was given only 30 minutes to speak out about that measure before that measure was put to a vote. And within nine hours, that bill was passed and signed into law.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the Legislature enacted a law, in effect, overturning what Charlotte had done. What were the provisions of the state legislation?\\n\\nGRAVES: The state law basically took away the power of local communities to provide rules to help kids and adults who have a different gender than the one on their birth certificate to be able to use restrooms that are most comfortable for them based on their own gender identity. And the bill not only preempted those measures, but it also had provisions in there that took away workplace discrimination practices that had been in place for decades.\\n\\nWhat it specifically said was this article, in essence, this part of state law, does not create and shall not be construed to create or support a statutory or common-law private right of action. And no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy in that law. And what that means is it takes away the rules for people who are fired or believe they've been fired because of their age, their race, their national origin, their religion or their gender.\\n\\nThat's one of the parts that was included in this bill that was rushed through the legislature. And also in that bill was an effort - was a provision to preempt cities from passing any increase in the minimum wage. So it was about much more than the transgender bathroom issue.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it actually went farther than the Charlotte - it went beyond repealing the provisions of the Charlotte ordinance?\\n\\nGRAVES: It went much, much farther and much faster. And the people of North Carolina are only just now really understanding the true impact of that measure.\\n\\nDAVIES: There's been a lot of attention about who can use what restrooms. Was that a specific provision of the state law?\\n\\nGRAVES: In essence, that was the target of it. But the law was much broader than that. And so while it clearly was targeting those restroom bills or those measures relating to public restrooms, it was much farther than that in terms of discrimination rules within the state of North Carolina, in terms of what cities could do to protect people from discrimination and to ensure equal treatment.\\n\\nDAVIES: This became a national story pretty quickly. What have been the consequences for North Carolina and its economy?\\n\\nGRAVES: There's been a substantial negative reaction to the decision in North Carolina, to the decision of legislature and the governor, to make that bill law. There have been threats about pulling out from major sporting events. And next door in Georgia, which was considering a similar bill, those threats from, you know, major sports have forced that governor to back away from a similar measure in that state.\\n\\nDAVIES: You said that this measure not only repealed some of the protections that the Charlotte law established, but it went farther and had other provisions relating to minimum wages and lawsuits. How common is it for state legislatures to overrule local ordinances these days?\\n\\nGRAVES: This is a new trend. And it's a growing trend, where we see state legislatures intervening in local actions on a variety of issues, including local measures to increase minimum wage, to provide for paid sick leave for workers, to address fracking - which involves the hydraulic pressure drilling for natural gas in people's backyards almost literally. You also see measures, for instance in Tennessee, where a city wanted to try to ensure that there were rewards for contractors who employed low-income workers or a small percentage - 10 percent - of low-income workers. That was preempted.\\n\\nYou have a situation in a number of communities, including Wisconsin, just this past week where cities are barred from regulating the use of plastic bags. We're seeing it in a variety of measures, including the LGBTQ community that was affected most specifically in North Carolina. And so it's increasingly the tool of choice for some governors and some legislatures, particularly Republicans - in fact, almost entirely Republicans, even though in South Dakota there was a governor there - a conservative governor - who rejected a similar bar on local communities taking action on restrooms.\\n\\nAnd he did so noting that local government is really important to people and that local government is the closest to the people. And he did not want to intrude on the decisions of those local governments.\\n\\nDAVIES: Most people think that when their local counsel or community leaders enact some legislation, it will govern their lives. How can states simply dismiss it?\\n\\nGRAVES: I think this is an example of where there's the law, and then there's tradition and practice. And so as a technical matter, as a legal matter, states are the sovereigns in this country vis-a-vis the federal government. And the state as a sovereign government, in essence, technically allows cities to exist or allows these local subdivisions of government to exist. You know, that's sort of the - as these cities have grown and thrived and we have so many more cities in the country, it's sort of the norm that we obviously have city governance.\\n\\nAnd so you have this technical reality, which is that for many cities, their power derives from the state. And the states can take it away unless there are specific rules within the Constitution or the statutes that protect those cities. But the reality is that we have relied on cities to provide a whole network of laws and rules and to enact an array of democratically-enacted measures that govern all sorts of aspects of our daily lives. And that's the norm. And this effort to try to take away city power is not the norm - certainly not the modern norm.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it may be legally sound but not the way we're used to governing ourselves?\\n\\nGRAVES: That's correct, although there may be some differences depending on whether a city has home rule under statutory provision or under the Constitution. But in general, it's just not the way things have been done in this country for many, many years, to have the states be taking away the authority of local communities. In fact, what you've had is the opposite. You've had a trend in which the rhetoric on the right and the left has been really pro-city, has really been focused on empowering cities and talking about cities as being crucial players in our democracy and in fact the most responsive part of our democracy in our federal, state and local systems.\\n\\nDAVIES: Our local leaders know best.\\n\\nGRAVES: That's what we hear all the time, except for recently.\\n\\nDAVIES: Let's go into some of the areas that local ordinances have taken up and then faced action from state legislatures. Sick leave is one. Give us an example of a city that's attempted to provide paid sick leave for workers.\\n\\nGRAVES: A couple years back in Milwaukee, there was a lot of activity around sick leave measures. There was actually a referendum in which 70 percent or more of the people voted to ensure that employers within the city of Milwaukee were providing workers with paid sick. And after that measure passed, the state Legislature that came in with Governor Walker - Scott Walker here in Wisconsin - passed a preemption measure to thwart that bill, basically to make it impossible to enforce and prevent the local community in Milwaukee or other cities around the state from adopting similar measures.\\n\\nAnd so in Wisconsin, you had a direct case of preemption, a direct case of state intervention in a highly popular local measure in Milwaukee. And then after that measure was thwarted by the state Legislature, the proponents of that measure took it to a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is a group that describes itself as the largest voluntary body of state legislators in the country.\\n\\nAnd in a closed-door meeting of one of its task forces, where corporations and politicians meet behind closed doors, that preemption measure was held up as a model for the nation. And the National Restaurant Association handed out a map of other cities that were considering or had adopted paid sick leave measures. And the legislators were told that in essence, they should be moving to preempt those measures wherever they are and try to thwart them wherever they could.\\n\\nDAVIES: Maybe you should just take a moment to explain a little bit more about what the American Legislative Exchange Council is, ALEC. What do they do?\\n\\nGRAVES: ALEC is an organization that we call a pay-to-play operation. We actually launched ALEC Exposed in 2011 after a whistleblower gave me all the bills that had been secretly voted on by corporate lobbyists with state legislators at ALEC task force meetings. When the whistleblower gave me these bills, there were nearly a thousand of them.\\n\\nThey covered nearly every domestic area of American law. And one of the pieces of paper that was in that set was a document that was a promotional document to recruit corporations to fund ALEC - to fund its trips for lawmakers, to fund its activities. And that recruitment document, called ALEC 101, said that the public sector and private sector get an equal voice and vote. That was the phrase it used, equal voice and vote.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's a little confusing when you talk about corporations voting on amendments and voting on legislation. You're talking about a private organization, this council, whose members include state lawmakers from around the country and corporations, and that they work together and develop model legislation, which are then sent back to states and introduced. Those are the votes you're talking about, these internal votes over what kind of legislature - what kind of model-recommended legislation ALEC will come up with?\\n\\nGRAVES: Yes. Yes. And so you do have organizations across the country that promote model bills or suggest legislation. You have lobbyists across the country that promote bills. What you have in ALEC is a situation in which corporations and corporate lobbyists are actually sitting in a room at a fancy resort. They are behind closed doors. The press and public are not allowed in those rooms.\\n\\nAnd the corporate lobbyists are actually taking an up or down vote, along with the state legislators, on these bills at ALEC task forces. And then they become models for the nation. And we see them moving, in many instances quite rapidly, once they become an ALEC model.\\n\\nDAVIES: Lisa Graves is executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with Lisa Graves. She is executive director of The Center for Media and Democracy. There was sort of an interesting twist on this whole phenomenon in Arizona. Tell us about that.\\n\\nGRAVES: In Arizona, in the city of Tempe, which is where one of the major universities in Arizona is, there was a study committee in which the city council and others were working with the local businesses to look into how to have a paid sick leave measure in that city.\\n\\nAnd the state legislature, which is, you know, dominated by Republicans and ALEC members, the members of American Legislative Exchange Council, have basically come forward and said if a city passes such a measure, the state will basically hold back funds for firefighters, for police. And so it will basically not do the revenue sharing that is traditional in Arizona between the state and the cities for providing funding for emergency services if a city dares to adopt a paid sick measure. And that basically stopped that measure in its tracks.\\n\\nDAVIES: Wow. So they didn't try and preempt the actual measures themselves. They simply said there will be consequences if they are enacted.\\n\\nGRAVES: It's a new form of preemption basically - that's right. If a city does adopt such a measure, it would be denied revenue. And certainly a city could go ahead and adopt such a measure and then try to litigate it, but in the meantime, it's a very difficult environment if the state actually goes through with that threat and does not give funding for police and firefighters. It's an extraordinary hammer to impose on, in essence, the idea of offering paid sick, of having a city require paid sick leave within its jurisdiction.\\n\\nDAVIES: You know, what's interesting about this issue is that you have local communities enacting ordinances to, you know, to regulate something like minimum wages or sick time or the use of plastic bags and then - state legislatures intervening to circumvent those restrictions.\\n\\nBut they all come from the same voting base, right? I mean, the legislatures, some of them are representing these very communities that enact these ordinances. Why is there such a disconnect between the politicians at the local level who are enacting some of these ordinances and those at the state level who are cracking down on them?\\n\\nGRAVES: Well, I think with respect to the state Senate jurisdictions, often these states have much smaller Senates, meaning fewer members representing larger areas. So it's certainly possible that some of the state senators do represent areas, more urban areas, that are passing these measures. But in general what we're seeing is a bit different, which is that you see legislatures that are covering the entire state geographically and so numerically have a large number of rural representatives, often Republican or conservative representatives.\\n\\nAnd then you have some cities and those city representatives who are outnumbered by those rural representatives. And so what you're seeing in some instances, although not all because you certainly have conservatives representing suburbs, for example, but what you're seeing in some ways is a very blue city, red state divide. And in Alabama, you have a situation which had another dimension to it, which is you have a city of Birmingham, a city that is now, after many years and a very long civil rights struggle, now led by African-American leaders in that city.\\n\\nYou have a high number of African-Americans living and residing in Birmingham. But you have a state legislature there in Alabama that is overwhelmingly majority white and a white governor, and the city of Birmingham, in essence, feels it's not being heard. Its concerns about the minimum wage are not being heard in the state legislature. And so they move forward with rules to govern the employers in their city to provide this very modest increase in the minimum wage of an hour to increase it $2.75 an hour to increase it.\\n\\nAnd you had a governor and a legislature that, you know, in essence utterly disrespected that decision and that determination by that local community and preempted it. And you had that happen in the context of a governor who had just recently given extraordinary pay increases to some of his key staffers.\\n\\nDAVIES: So you often have cities that are enacting these ordinances but they're outnumbered by rural and suburban legislators in the state the state capital.\\n\\nGRAVES: That's correct. That's correct. That's what we're seeing in a lot of places. You have very progressive cities and you can see that play out in both the local elections for mayor, in many instances, as well as in the races for Congress and in the presidential races when you look at the big map of where it's blue and where it's red.\\n\\nDAVIES: What's the argument? I mean, why does the state have to be uniform in these areas? What's the argument for preventing communities from tailoring legislation to their own needs and interests?\\n\\nGRAVES: Well, the argument is that businesses don't want to have a patchwork of laws - that's the term you'll often hear. They don't want to have to deal with a patchwork of conflicting regulations. But the fact is is that businesses deal with a patchwork of regulations all the time. Different cities have different zoning rules. Often cities have different tax rates or individual tax rates. Businesses deal with those on a regular basis.\\n\\nAnd so that argument I think is unpersuasive. In fact, it's not this patchwork - they don't want those bills anywhere. They don't want to have a higher minimum wage. They don't want that higher minimum wage at the city or the state level. And so the patchwork argument is really, I think, a bit of a red herring, but that's argument that you hear.\\n\\nGROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Lisa Graves, executive director of The Center for Media and Democracy. We'll hear more after a break. Also rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album by singer and songwriter Robbie Fulks. And John Powers will review a new dramatic film that he says takes you places and shows you things you haven't seen before. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded about what's become an increasingly common pattern in which towns and cities pass laws - ranging from laws banning discrimination against LGBTQ people to increasing the minimum wage, mandating paid sick leave and banning fracking - only to have their state legislature pass a law that overrules the local ordinance. This has become known as preemption. Our guest, Lisa Graves, has been tracking the trend for PR Watch, the online news journal of The Center of Media and Democracy. She's the center's director.\\n\\nDAVIES: You know, here in Philadelphia there were - there was a measure to enact paid sick leave for private employers in the city. It was vetoed twice, I believe, by Mayor Nutter - eventually signed on a third attempt. And this is, you know, a democratic mayor of a city, and he talks a lot about poverty. He's done a lot to fund education. And his argument was - in vetoing the sick leave bill - was yes, it is humane, it's fair, it's rational, it's a good public health initiative.\\n\\nBut the fact is we're a city desperate for jobs and we're - already have disadvantages as compared to surrounding communities. We have high crime, a high tax burden, poor schools. And if you impose a financial burden on businesses that the surrounding communities don't have, it's going to be a disincentive for job growth. I'm just wondering - I'm sure that argument is made on a lot of these things - is there any data that tells us whether they're right?\\n\\nGRAVES: I think that that - those claims have not been proven statistically. In Philadelphia, you had a situation in which that mayor, you know, ultimately changed his mind - perhaps in view of his legacy. And after vetoing that paid sick measure at the local Chamber of Commerce there, he was ultimately convinced to allow this measure to go into effect and allow people to have paid sick leave. I think you have a situation where these measures are extremely popular and - in fact, in many employers, they're the norm, to have paid sick leave.\\n\\nBut you have a subset of workers who are, in some ways, some of our most disadvantaged workers who do not have this basic benefit that helps them to get well when they're sick or even to take care of a sick child - that these things happen to people. And that's why we were so surprised when we were provided with materials about a poll that was taken earlier at the end of last year and that unveiled earlier this year about how popular paid sick leave is not just by ordinary people - and for ordinary people - but even by CEOs, by chief executive officers and other leaders of businesses. That poll of nearly a thousand - of actually a thousand business leaders across the country showed overwhelming supermajority support for paid sick leave to be the law in this country.\\n\\nIt was in the range of 70 to 80 percent in favor for paid sick, for increased minimum wage, for having this predictive scheduling and for having expanded paternity and family leave. And so what you have is a situation in which these are popular policies, the people want them, and now we have evidence that even - many businesses want them and support them. But you have a pretty narrow - a set of people who are actively arguing against them and using, I think, some deeply flawed studies to try to oppose these really popular and good policies.\\n\\nDAVIES: I want to explore this. Your organization came up with this survey of business executives by the Luntz Global polling firm. That's Frank Luntz's firm. And it was done for the Council of State Chambers, right? This is essentially a Council of State Chambers of Congress, is that right?\\n\\nGRAVES: Yes, every state has a state chamber. And it's the council of the executives of those chambers, which means basically the lead lobbyists, the executive director, of each of those state chambers of commerce.\\n\\nDAVIES: And there's - on your website, I believe, there's access to a webinar in which the pollsters are discussing the results of these - this survey of business executives in which, as I understand it, they find that, in fact, that increasing the minimum wage is favored by a lopsided margin, providing paid sick leave also favored by a lopsided margin, of business executives. And yet, the pollsters are explaining the members of the state - the lobbyists for the state chambers how to still defeat those measures, is that right?\\n\\nGRAVES: That's correct. So paid sick was supported 73 percent to 16 percent - this is by CEOs from across the country, in each region of the country. Minimum wage increasing - it was supported 80 percent to 8. And what happens in this presentation that's on our site at PR Watch is during this webinar, when these poll findings are unveiled, these state lobbyists for the business community, state chamber lobbyists, are being told how to overcome this empathy.\\n\\nSo, for example, in the fight over increase the minimum wage, even though these state chambers are supposed to represent those businesses - this was a survey of their own members, and their target members - these state chamber executives were told here's how to fight back. Here's how to combat these popular measures to increase the minimum wage. And they were told, for example, in that area to pivot to the earned income tax credit to try to talk about something else rather than the minimum wage. And it was interesting to see.\\n\\nThis was sort of surprising, in fact, because all of us have heard this claim that businesses oppose these measures. Some of these chambers will be able to bring forth a couple of businesses to be examples to speak out against these measures. But it turns out that those businesses are the outliers, that most businesses, when they're asked, most executives when they're asked support these\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, it doesn't exactly make sense. I mean, it seems to me you have an organization here whose leaders are instructing their lobbyists to oppose measures that their own members favor, right? I mean, why would they do that? Did you ask them?\\n\\nGRAVES: We did not ask them. The Washington Post, which broke this story, did ask about that question. And basically the state chamber said that they're not active - really active in these fights. Well, I can tell you we watch it in cities and states across the country. And those state chambers are super active in these fights. Forty-nine of the 50 chambers have actively opposed to increase the minimum wage. They've been active in opposing paid sick leave. And that question of why is really interesting. It turns out that the state chambers have a close alliance with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nAnd the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is, you know, an enormous lobbying powerhouse in Congress. And after a change in leadership a couple decades ago, it really changed its approach to focus on the biggest businesses in the country - indeed in the world - such that the majority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's millions and millions in revenue comes from just 64 donors. And so I think you have a situation in which there's a lot of distortion as a result of these global corporations and what they want our wages to be or where they think the wages should be in this country versus what most people in most businesses want.\\n\\nIn fact, you know, one of the things that was really surprising to me when I first began looking at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which, you know, is involved in these fights, was that not only did they oppose increasing the minimum wage, they opposed even having a minimum wage. And we've certainly seen some of that rhetoric on a campaign trail in this primary season as well.\\n\\nDAVIES: Both New York and California have recently enacted increases in the minimum wage. What does that tell us about what's going on?\\n\\nGRAVES: In those states you have a majority of Democrats and Democratic governors, and so you do have an atmosphere that's less hostile to this clamoring for addressing these wage issues. But I think that that's huge. Those are two enormous states and those states are, you know, moving forward with an increase in the minimum wage, which has not been increased for many, many, many years in California. There's a staging in of that increase over the next six years approximately. And so you're going to see those laws take effect over these coming years in California.\\n\\nAnd I think that that will help set an example for other states that they can enact increased minimum wages and it doesn't devastate the economy. It helps those economies be stronger. But I suppose in that sense that you certainly can't make a patchwork argument against California or New York. But I would say that, again, that sort of argument that you have to have uniform rules across every state no matter what city you're in is just belied by experience. One of the reasons why different people live in different cities is in part because of the different cultures of those cities or the different maybe protections of those cities. Maybe they've got better zoning rules. Maybe they have a more thoughtful urban planning process.\\n\\nThere are a lot of differences between cities and towns and communities in our states and in our country. And I think that this idea that the cities have to be uniform is just not really the American way. Now, that said, there are certain rules that have been passed over time that are national rules, like this national minimum wage. That's a floor, not a ceiling. In the area of civil rights, there are national civil rights laws to prevent discrimination, but that's a floor and not a ceiling.\\n\\nWhat you're seeing with this trend of preemption is basically trying to make the state - the state's low standard the only standard and to prevent the type of experimentation that has made our democracy thrive where states have been the laboratories of experimentation and so have cities. And so these efforts, I think, are very shortsighted and, in fact, very narrow-minded efforts to prevent that type of experimentation to really help our cities and our states grow and thrive.\\n\\nDAVIES: Lisa Graves, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nGRAVES: Thank you so much for having me on.\\n\\nGROSS: Lisa Graves is the executive director of The Center for Media and Democracy.

{"original": "Border Patrol Faces Backlash From Aid Groups Over Migrant Deaths\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images\\n\\nAs lawmakers in Washington consider a path forward on immigration policy, the debate is playing out along desolate stretches of the southwestern border where at least 7,209 people have died while crossing illegally over the past 20 years.\\n\\nA report by the aid group No More Deaths claiming that Border Patrol agents routinely sabotage humanitarian efforts is also highlighting the tensions between federal agents and volunteers who try to help migrants. Last week, No More Deaths suggested that the recent arrest of a volunteer for harboring migrants in a well-known Arizona safe house was retaliation for the report.\\n\\nWhile humanitarian groups argue Border Patrol is purposely funneling migrants into dangerous sections along the U.S.-Mexico border, agents on the ground say it is mostly smugglers who lead migrants into these hazardous areas, says Steven Passement, acting special operations supervisor in the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson sector.\\n\\nThe smugglers are the ones that are taking these folks out into these extreme desolate areas, and unfortunately, they're lying to them. They're leaving them out there, he tells Here & Now's Robin Young. Those are the realities that we want folks to understand and know before coming.\\n\\nSmugglers lie to migrants about the duration of the journey and the harsh environment, Passement says. Migrants are often beaten and raped by smugglers and left behind in the desert.\\n\\nIn the Tucson sector, we want a message that this is not the environment you want to cross in, he says. We want to make this as difficult as possible for the smugglers.\\n\\nAt the same time, Passement says Border Patrol agents have stepped up their own humanitarian efforts. More than 30 rescue beacons are placed throughout the most dangerous area of the Arizona desert, he says, which led to the rescue of more than 1,400 people in 2016. The Tucson sector also employs more than 200 EMTs to help migrants who need medical assistance.\\n\\nDespite these efforts, activists argue that Border Patrol created this problem when it heightened enforcement along safer routes in California and Texas starting in the mid-1990s. Alicia Dinsmore, a volunteer with No More Deaths, told Young last week that Border Patrol is creating this crisis in the first place.\\n\\nBorder Patrol's attempts at rescuing people and saving people's lives is really a Band-Aid solution because the crisis of death and human disappearance we are seeing along the U.S.-Mexico border is a direct result of a policy that started going into place in the mid-'90s that forced people into this terrain, she says.\\n\\nThe backlash comes at a difficult time for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has struggled to retain border agents. The agency is nearly 2,000 agents short of a federal mandate requiring 21,370 agents on the force, according to federal data.\\n\\nThe manpower shortage is getting worse, GOP Rep. Martha McSally, chairwoman of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, said at a congressional hearing earlier this month. We are losing ground every single month and there is no end in sight as we continue to lose experienced agents and officers through attrition without the ability to efficiently hire new ones.\\n\\nPassement acknowledges that border enforcement has evolved since the 1990s because it is now easier to detect people crossing illegally. But he insists that Border Patrol agents want to work with non-governmental organizations to help migrants in distress.\\n\\nThe border's changed drastically over the years. There's more technology now, more manpower, more infrastructure, so the chances of being detained or apprehended are greater than ever before, he says. We look forward to trying to work with these individuals, these groups, come together because I'll tell you we have a similar goal. We want to save lives."}

We did not take action to start a war, Trump said Friday afternoon from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\\n\\nWe take comfort in knowing his reign of terror is over, Trump added, praising the military for executing a flawless precision strike.\\n\\nSoleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and personnel, the president said.\\n\\nWhat the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago, he said, adding this was not done to prompt regime change in Iran.\\n\\nCan't see the video?

Chris Murphy told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Friday. Is Qassem Soleimani more dangerous as a martyr than he was alive as the functional leader of the Quds Force? There will be reprisals.\\n\\nOne key concern driving the split between Republicans and Democrats is outlook: It appears the White House only alerted certain Republicans on Capitol Hill of the attack ahead of time. Senior Democratic members of Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, say they were largely left in the dark ahead of the strike.\\n\\nPelosi, who said Thursday that the strike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence, didn't gather details of the operation until afterward, a congressional aide told NPR. The House speaker spoke to Defense Secretary Mike Esper for 13 minutes, around 9:40 p.m. Washington time after the airstrike, the aide said.\\n\\nIn the past, members of the Gang of Eight, the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the chair and ranking members of their respective intelligence committees, had been briefed on such operations. That was not the case this time, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Friday.\\n\\nThis action may well have brought our nation closer to another endless war, exactly the kind of endless war the president promised he would not drag us into, Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\\n\\nMoments earlier on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he spoke to Esper on details of the attack on Iran's master terrorist, adding he is working to coordinate a classified briefing for senators early next week.\\n\\nAlthough I anticipate and welcome a debate about America's interest in foreign policy in the Middle East, I recommend that all senators wait to review the facts and hear from the administration before passing much public judgment on this operation and its potential consequences, he said.\\n\\nEarlier Friday, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox & Friends that he was told about the planned attack during a recent golf outing with the president. Graham was spotted at the president's course in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday.\\n\\nFox News via YouTube\\n\\nWhen it comes to the death of General Soleimani, there is no one to blame but himself, Graham tweeted Friday morning. He effectively signed his own death warrant by planning massive attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.\\n\\nOther Republican lawmakers lauded the attacks in statements overnight, saying that Soleimani was a ruthless leader who directed the deaths of many Americans and others. He got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said shortly following news of the attack.\\n\\nU.S. officials estimate Soleimani, his militia and their Iraqi proxies are behind the deaths of scores of American service members during the war in Iraq.\\n\\nDemocrats' criticism of the White House's failure to brief Congress ahead of the operation touches on a years-long debate that the president's war powers are woefully outdated. Democrats are leading calls for a new legislation addressing the president's Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF.\\n\\nCongress last issued these war power directives in 2001 and 2002 in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and there has been a push to address Iran in a potential AUMF.\\n\\nIn June, a measure to ban unauthorized attacks on Iran or its officials failed in the Republican-controlled Senate by a vote of 50 to 40. On Friday, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said he had introduced a new war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran. We're now at a boiling point, and Congress must step in before Trump puts even more of our troops in harm's way, he said.\\n\\nMichigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who specialized in threats in the region, said the administration's next steps are critical.\\n\\nShe noted that a new war power resolution is needed if further military actions against Iran were to continue.\\n\\nWhat always kept both Democratic and Republican presidents from targeting Soleimani himself was the simple question: Was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into protracted conflict? Slotkin said. The two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn't justify the means. The Trump Administration has made a different calculation.\\n\\nNPR's Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."}

{"original": "ICE Detention Beds New Stumbling Block In Efforts To Prevent Another Shutdown\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 5:03 p.m. ET\\n\\nAs the clock ticks toward a Friday deadline to avert another partial government shutdown, a new stumbling block has emerged in talks between congressional Democrats and the White House: Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds.\\n\\nThe Trump administration said last month that it wanted $4.2 billion to support 52,000 detention beds. Given that in recent months, the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally has risen to 2,000 per day, providing additional resources for detention and transportation is essential, the White House said.\\n\\nBut Democrats are seeking to cap the number of detention beds. In a statement Sunday, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., asserted that A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country.\\n\\nRoybal-Allard chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security and is a member of the House-Senate conference committee trying to reach an agreement on spending levels.\\n\\nDemocrats want to limit to 16,500 the number of beds used in the interior of the country, where ICE places people it arrests who have overstayed their visas or committed misdemeanor crimes. Roybal-Allard charges the Trump administration with\\n\\npursuing an out-of-control deportation policy focused on removing immigrants with no criminal records, many of whom have deep roots in their communities. This approach is cruel and wrong. A cap on detention beds associated with interior enforcement will rein in the Trump administration's deportation agenda.\\n\\nDemocrats say a cap of 16,500 would restore immigration enforcement to levels in place at the end of the Obama administration. A House Democratic aide speaking on background said Democratic and Republican negotiators had agreed to reduce funding overall for ICE detentions to a range between 34,000 and 38,500 beds by the end of the year.\\n\\nIn a briefing call on Monday, ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence said any cap on detention beds would be extremely damaging to public safety. He said ICE is currently detaining 20,000 to 22,000 individuals in the interior of the country, away from the border.\\n\\nIn a Sunday interview on Fox Business, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of the Democratic position, Not only is it enough they want to abolish ICE. They want to abolish the bed spaces available to the country to house violent offenders so they can be held and deported. Graham added, I promise you this: Donald Trump is not going to sign any bill that reduces the number of bed spaces available to hold violent offenders who come across our border. He can't do that. He won't do that, and you can take that to the bank.\\n\\nPresident Trump tweeted on Monday that The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!\\n\\nBut Democrats say they want nothing of the sort. Roybal-Allard said the cap will ensure that the Trump administration targets violent felons and other people who pose security risks for deportation, instead of pursuing reckless mass deportation policies that actually make us less safe."}

Afterwards, Pompeo proceeded to shout his displeasure at being questioned about Ukraine. He used repeated expletives, according to Kelly. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kelly will not be discussing the interview with external press at this time.\\n\\nHighlights from the interview are available below, and can be attributed to NPR. Select audio clips for coverage can be made upon request by emailing: mediarelations@npr.org\\n\\nListen to the interview on NPR.org. The full interview will air on All Things Considered this afternoon, Friday, January 24.\\n\\nOn whether the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on Iran is working given the fact that Iran is closer to having a nuclear weapon than they were when Trump took office:\\n\\nThis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. And the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program. It was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off. It's been realistic. We accept the facts on the ground as they are.\\n\\nOn whether any diplomatic talks have been opened between the U.S. and Iran:\\n\\nYou know, we never talk about private conversations that are taking place, but the diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously successful. We built out a significant coalition that has put pressure on the Iranian regime to do what we've asked: to cease its processing of uranium, reprocessing of plutonium, to stop its missile program and the development of its missile program. President Trump made clear they're not going to have a nuclear program that is capable of delivering these weapons around the world. And then finally, working to convince them that their model, this proxy model that they've used to conduct terror campaigns, assassinations in Europe, assassination attempt right here in Washington, D.C., is not tolerable.\\n\\nOn how the administration plans to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon:\\n\\nWe'll stop them.\\n\\nOn whether he owes former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, an apology for her ouster in 2019:\\n\\nYou know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration. I'm proud of the work we've done. This administration delivered the capability for the Ukrainians to defend themselves. President Obama showed up with MREs (meals, ready-to-eat.) We showed up with Javelin missiles. The previous administration did nothing to take down corruption in Ukraine. We're working hard on that. We're going to continue to do it.\\n\\nWhen pushed on the question of whether he defended or should defend Yovanovitch:\\n\\nI have defended every State Department official. We've built a great team.

{"original": "Thousands Of Central American Migrants Stuck In Tijuana, Waiting To Seek Asylum\\n\\nThousands of Central American migrants are living in shelters in Tijuana, waiting their turn to ask for asylum. Some are getting jobs, planning on a long stay, while others are growing more desperate.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump says there's a humanitarian and national security crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border. This idea of a border emergency can be traced back to the reports that began a few months ago of a caravan of Central American migrants traveling up through Mexico to the U.S. Many of those migrants are now stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, just south of the border from San Diego. And that's where NPR's John Burnett joins us from now. Hi, John.\\n\\nJOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: We've heard about thousands of migrants stuck in Tijuana. What are you seeing there?\\n\\nBURNETT: Well, you know, this is ground zero of what the president considers the migrant crisis. I mean, you've got Central Americans who are waiting in all the major Mexican border cities, but Tijuana is where you really see them. You know, we started out with somewhere between, you know, 5,000, 6,000 migrants who'd come up in the caravan. The numbers are definitely down to perhaps 2,000, 3,000, even (inaudible) migrants now that are still here.\\n\\nSome have gone back to Honduras. Some have been deported by Mexican authorities. Some have crossed into the U.S. to request asylum. And then others, you know, crossed the border illegally. They climbed the fence, and they were arrested. And then, still others went to other Mexican border cities where there's less of a wait to cross. So, you know, they have - the numbers are trickling down.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: So the numbers are down, but still a lot of people for Tijuana to deal with. How is the city coping?\\n\\nBURNETT: You know, it's just - it's sort of chaotic what we've seen today. There is more than a dozen shelters here. The big one, El Barretal, you know, it's the best organized. It's run by the federal government. And then you have all these others. We went to one that was run by the Ambassadors of Christ evangelical church, where you had people living in tents inside the church sanctuary. But outside was this squalid drainage ditch with hogs all rooting around and children around there playing.\\n\\nAnd yet, people in Tijuana are trying to help the migrants. And so you have these shelters that have just kind of sprung up in houses and with different, you know, do-gooder groups and with churches. And, really, you just get this sense that they still don't know what to do with this crush of people who are here.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: What about Americans? You're right over the border from San Diego. Do you see many U.S. people there trying to help out?\\n\\nBURNETT: You do. There's lots of volunteers. They're over here. They're offering legal advice. They're bringing food. They're bringing medicine. Some are bringing, you know, knitting needles and yarn for them - you know, give them something to do while they're waiting. I mean, this morning they called number 1,627. That's how many migrant families have gotten into the U.S. to ask for asylum. And there are still many, many more waiting weeks.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: What are you hearing from the migrants themselves you've spoken to?\\n\\nBURNETT: Well, these are single men. These are families. They're grandmothers. And, you know, they've been here waiting for so long, some for six to eight weeks. And they seem to be, you know, very frustrated. Some are still waiting in line for their numbers to be called. And others are deciding to take jobs here in Tijuana. There is a labor shortage, and so some are working as masons. Others are going to work in these fabrication plants, the maquilas.\\n\\nAnd then, still others have decided to brincar el muro, to jump the wall. And so they go to this area where they can crawl over one of the lower fences, where they're promptly arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol. But they know that that's a rash decision, that they're going to be detained if they do that. And so many want to wait, but they're really getting frustrated here because the times are so long.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. Just in our last 30 seconds, President Trump last month announced a policy called Remain in Mexico, where asylum seekers would have to wait in Mexico for an immigration hearing in the U.S. Any sign of that taking shape?\\n\\nBURNETT: You know, that policy has been suspended, Ari. I spoke to a senior government official familiar with border security plans. And because of the complexities of the diplomacy between Mexico and the U.S., they are not returning immigrants seeking asylum to Mexico to await their immigration cases. The ones who are going to the border largely are being allowed to ask for asylum and then being either detained or released with a notice to appear in immigration court.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: All right.

{"original": "On Separating Migrant Families\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nAnd now we're going to hear from a defender of the Trump administration's controversial practice of separating families who enter the U.S. illegally at the border. Parents are taken into ICE custody while their children are sent to the Department of Health and Human Services. There have been multiple stories of parents losing contact with their kids - some young toddlers. Jessica Vaughan is the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit that advocates for less immigration. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nJESSICA VAUGHAN: Thank you.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: In your view, why do we need this family separation policy?\\n\\nVAUGHAN: Well, there are no great options here. Because of the policies of the last few years, we've had more than 300,000 families and unaccompanied minors who've paid smugglers to bring them across. And most don't end up actually pursuing an asylum claim or any other claim that would allow them to stay. So the government needs to keep them in custody so that the immigration process can be completed. And their options are limited. They would rather keep families together in a family detention center. And that's what the policy was for a number of years until 2015, when a federal judge in California decided that kids could not be kept in custody and ordered the Obama administration to release the kids. And that has meant often that the parents had to be released also. The Trump administration has taken a different approach - in some cases, is holding the parents, and the kids are placed into HHS custody.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Critics of this policy - and there are many - first argue that this isn't actually a deterrent. People traveling with their children are often fleeing for their lives. They're threatened by gangs. And even with this policy in place, crossings are up. Here's Kay Andrade of Catholic Relief Services in El Salvador.\\n\\nKAY ANDRADE: The risk of migration, even with all these barriers, is still less than staying here.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So one of the central arguments from the Trump administration is this is a deterrent, but it doesn't seem to be working.\\n\\nVAUGHAN: Well, I think it's too early to tell. I mean, the zero tolerance policy has only been in effect for a few weeks. And I think it takes time for the message to get through. The reality is, too, is that if people really feel that they're in danger of their lives, Mexico has been offering people from Central America the opportunity to apply for asylum there. So we may see and already have seen a number of people decide that that's a better option than trying to make it all the way to the United States with the policies changing under President Trump.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Right. But Mexico, of course, has its own problem with drug violence and other issues. You know, reporting on this issue has shown that the Trump administration was trying not to draw attention to this practice at the border, that, actually, they were doing this for quite some time. But they weren't advertising it. And the only way it fully came to light was through the ACLU and journalists reporting on what was actually happening at the border. So if you're saying that the object is deterrence, then why were they trying to hide it?\\n\\nVAUGHAN: We should not have a policy that encourages people to take this long journey that's dangerous and costly and pay a smuggler to try to bring them across illegally, only to arrive in the United States and join the illegal population. And what would be ideal would be for Congress to pass legislation that overrules the judge's decision that is forcing the government to release the kids and to modify our asylum system. And we should also help these other countries over the long term to improve conditions. But what we're doing now clearly is not working. And until prospective migrants in other countries realize that things have changed, they're going to continue to come. And so for the short term, we're going to have the situation where they're placed in custody.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center of Immigration Studies. Thank you very much.\\n\\nVAUGHAN: Thank you very much.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Canada's Legislature Votes To Legalize Marijuana; Sales Will Begin In Weeks\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Wattie/Reuters Chris Wattie/Reuters\\n\\nUpdated at 8:05 p.m. ET\\n\\nRecreational marijuana may soon be legal in Canada, after both the House of Commons and the Senate approved the Cannabis Act. Legal sales are likely to begin before the end of summer after the Senate voted 52-29 Tuesday night to approve the bill, the CBC reports.\\n\\nWe've just witnessed a historic vote for Canada. The end of 90 years of prohibition, Sen. Tony Dean, one of the bill's sponsors, told the CBC. Transformative social policy, I think. A brave move on the part of the government.\\n\\nCanada's minister of justice sponsored the cannabis bill; the government announced its push for legalization last spring with an official news release that stated, The current approach to cannabis does not work.\\n\\nThe government said that making marijuana illegal has allowed criminals and organized crime to profit, while failing to keep cannabis out of the hands of Canadian youth.\\n\\nIt added, In many cases, it is easier for our kids to buy cannabis than cigarettes.\\n\\nThose points were echoed by Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last fall, when he welcomed the news that the bill was making its way to the Senate.\\n\\nThe proposed law would make it legal for anyone over the age of 18 to possess marijuana, provided that it is less than 30 grams (just over an ounce). It also allows Canadians to grow up to four marijuana plants in their home.\\n\\nThe bill's authors write that legalization would have several benefits, from protecting the health of young people (by restricting access) to undercutting criminal enterprises and reducing the workload of the criminal justice system. It would also allow for quality control and public health awareness campaigns.\\n\\nBut critics of the bill say that part of the reason they want to keep marijuana illegal is that they're not convinced that the government will be able to disrupt the marijuana black market to any substantial degree.\\n\\nThat was one point raised by Conservative Sen. Percy Mockler, who said on Monday that the initiative suffers from a serious absence of policy analysis.\\n\\nDuring the debate, Sen. Peter Harder, the government representative in the Senate, said:\\n\\nPassing this bill will mean the end of an historic era of prohibition that has punished Canadians with a criminal sanction for what is essentially a health decision. Over the years, how many Canadians have needlessly been given the social stigma and employment barrier of a criminal conviction?\\n\\nCanada's government has also published the results of a cannabis survey, based on more than 9,000 responses from people across the country, ages 16 and up.\\n\\nIn the survey, About half of all respondents indicated that cannabis had a positive effect on a person's mood (51 percent), creativity (45 percent), anxiety (50 percent), and sleep (49 percent), Canada's Health Ministry said.\\n\\nThe government also said 77 percent of all survey respondents thought that using cannabis could be habit forming.\\n\\nMedical marijuana has been legal in Canada since the early 2000s. If it legalizes recreational use now, it would give America's northern neighbor another competitive edge in what is widely seen as an emerging and lucrative industry.\\n\\nYou've got big American alcohol and tobacco companies making investments in Canadian pot firms, because they see an opening, as Peter O'Dowd reported for NPR's Here & Now last month.\\n\\nOne expert told O'Dowd that because of America's more restrictive laws, We are literally giving the next multibillion-dollar industry ... to the Canadians."}
{"original": "Democrats could field an anti-fracking candidate in 2020. Can they win in Pennsylvania?\\n\\nVoters are split on the question of a fracking ban\\n\\nReid Frazier Bio Recent Stories Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.\\n\\nStanding on the side of a road that hugs the Ohio River, Jeff Nobers stared across the water at a massive construction site: towering cranes, scaffolding, a maze of pipes.\\n\\nOn the site of what will be Shell's multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant, 6,000 union workers are putting together an ethane cracker, which will turn a natural gas byproduct into plastic.\\n\\nRight now, the biggest trades here are the operating engineers and steamfitters, because a lot of the piping work is being done now, said Nobers, executive director of the Builders Guild of Western Pennsylvania, which includes many of the unions working on the site. There's a lot of overtime. So you have people making well over six figures.\\n\\nNobers says if Democrats nominate someone who wants to ban fracking, they'd have a tough time winning over some of his members.\\n\\nThe union leaders he works with might not tell their rank-and-file members he works with who to vote for, he said. But they would be very clear to say, 'Look, if you vote for this person, this is what they stand for. And, you know, at the end of it, you know, this is your livelihood and the livelihoods of many others.'\\n\\nReid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\\n\\nPresidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both said they want to move away from fossil fuels, and they support a ban on fracking for natural gas or oil. Though natural gas is pushing dirtier coal off the electric grid, scientists warn we need to phase out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels in the next few decades\\n\\nAnd fracking can release the powerful greenhouse gas methane.\\n\\nWhile natural gas may burn cleaner than coal, the enormous explosion of fracking and the resulting release of methane presents a significant danger to our planet, Sanders told a crowd in 2016.\\n\\nWarren tweeted in September: On my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking—everywhere.\\n\\nExperts doubt a president could simply ban fracking without congressional approval.\\n\\nEd Crooks, vice chair in the Americas for the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, says a president might be able to restrict fracking on public lands, but probably not on private or state land, where most fracking takes place. Crooks says the talk is more rhetorical than anything.\\n\\nTalking about banning fracking is for Democrats a bit like bringing back coal was for President Trump, Crooks said. President Trump hasn't been able to revive the coal industry, but by talking about bringing back coal, he was sending a signal. He was talking about his strategy and the direction of his policy.\\n\\nReid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\\n\\nSome political observers think an anti-fracking message could hurt a candidate in Pennsylvania, where 30,000 people work in oil and gas, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, and thousands more work in related industries.\\n\\nDo you lose some moderate Democrats or independents who have interest in the natural gas industry if you call for shutting it down? said Chris Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College who's studied public opinion on the topic. I think the answer is probably 'Yes.'\\n\\nBorick said a lot of people in the state are concerned about climate change and the environment, but he says other topics, like the economy, still rate as more important.\\n\\nI think the proven method, the method that is shown to be successful time and time again is to win moderate Democrats, moderate voters in the state, Borick said.\\n\\nThose voters include people like Kevin Kopac, who owns an insurance agency near the Shell chemical plant in Beaver County. A registered Democrat, Kopac twice voted for Obama before going for Trump in 2016.\\n\\nHe grew up in a union household in Beaver County. He says construction at the Shell plant has been good for the local economy.\\n\\nThere's always jobs around, but these are (jobs with) a lot higher wages than what Beaver County has been used to for the past 20, 30 years.\\n\\nKopac's undecided about this fall's election but says if the Democratic nominee is anti-fracking, he would be less likely to vote for a Democrat. For the simple fact that (fracking) affects our region. It creates a lot of jobs, for a lot of people.\\n\\nJohn Kubicar, a real estate agent in Washington County, says if Democrats nominate an anti-fracking candidate, it will hurt their chances in his county, which leads the state in shale gas wells. There's too many people that are in favor of it around these areas, said Kubicar, a registered Democrat who voted for Trump and plans to do the same in November.\\n\\nWhen these wells go in, I have friends that have restaurants and bars in the area, they're packed.\\n\\nReid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\\n\\nBut other voters might be fine with an anti-fracking candidate.\\n\\nRecent polls find Pennsylvania voters are roughly split on whether to ban fracking.\\n\\nA January Franklin & Marshall College poll found that 48 percent of Pennsylvania voters favored a ban on fracking, while 39 percent were opposed. A Morning Call/Muhlenberg College poll conducted in February found 42 percent of voters in the state opposed a fracking ban, with 38 percent in favor.\\n\\nThat same poll found Sanders leading Trump 49-46 percent and Warren tied with Trump 47-47 percent in hypothetical head-to-head matchups.\\n\\nThe Franklin & Marshall poll found support for a ban was strongest in the state's two big cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\\n\\nBrianna Mims, a University of Pittsburgh student from suburban Philadelphia, said she'd like to vote for a candidate who's against fracking.\\n\\nBecause I am someone that really values the environment and I think anything we can to stop the way we're torturing the environment is beneficial, she said.\\n\\nGerald Medved said he'd be okay with an anti-fracking candidate. A retired union coalminer, Medved is a registered Democrat who voted Trump in 2016, a decision he now regrets. He says Trump's been too divisive and hasn't kept his promises on health care and trade.\\n\\nHis own experience with the gas industry has been mixed.\\n\\nI feel it's some good. And a lot of bad. And the bad is we don't really know.\\n\\nHe says his groundwater was temporarily polluted when a gas company drilled a well near his house in Fayette County, along the West Virginia border.\\n\\nIf they pollute this water, say, 20, 30 years down the road, how are we ever going to clean it up? he said.\\n\\nMedved's views on fracking are also related to his views about climate change. He says he's seen the climate changing with his own eyes.\\n\\nWith fracking, I think you have to look at the scientists in the United States, the people that are saying there's global warming. And figure. Do you want to do something about it now or wait until it's too late? Medved said.\\n\\nFracking might be one of the issues Pennsylvania voters weigh when they decide an election that could be close come November.\\n\\nAnd with a president who embraces fossil fuels and has already visited the state 14 times, voters are sure to hear plenty about it.\\n\\nEditor's Picks"}
{"original": "Insurers Revoke Policies To Avoid Paying High Costs\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Rep. Joe Barton Courtesy Rep. Joe Barton\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy Peggy Raddatz\\n\\nAccording to a new report by congressional investigators, an insurance company practice of retroactively canceling health insurance is fairly common, and it saves insurers a lot of money.\\n\\nA subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently held a hearing about the report's findings in an effort to bring a halt to this practice. But at the hearing, insurance executives told lawmakers they have no plans to stop rescinding policies.\\n\\nThe act of retroactively canceling insurance is called rescission. It happens with individual health insurance policies, where people apply for insurance on their own, not through their employers. Their application generally includes a questionnaire about their health.\\n\\nThe process begins after a policyholder has been diagnosed with an expensive condition such as cancer. The insurer then reviews the health status information in the questionnaire, and if anything is missing, the policy may be rescinded.\\n\\nThe omission from the application may be deliberate, to hide a health condition that might have made the applicant ineligible for insurance. But sometimes there's an innocent explanation: The policyholder may not have known about a health condition, or may not have thought it was relevant.\\n\\nThe rescissions based on omissions or immaterial conditions incensed many lawmakers.\\n\\nI think it's shocking, it's inexcusable. It's a system that we have in place and we've got to stop, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said at the hearing.\\n\\nFrom the other side of the aisle, Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) was also appalled.\\n\\nDoesn't it bother you to do this? he asked Don Hamm, CEO of Assurant Health, who appeared with the CEOs of UnitedHealth's Golden Rule Insurance Co. and WellPoint's Consumer Business.\\n\\nLosing Insurance At A Critical Time\\n\\nHamm's insurance company rescinded the policy of Otto Raddatz after he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Raddatz had not told the company about a CT scan by a now-retired doctor that showed gallstones and a weakened blood vessel.\\n\\nThat's because he didn't know about the findings, his sister Peggy Raddatz, an attorney, testified. She spent weeks on the phone and ended up at the Illinois Attorney General's office, which began an investigation. The retired doctor turned out to be off on a fishing trip.\\n\\nLuckily, they were able to find the doctor, who was able to say, 'Yes, I never discussed those issues with him; they were very minor,'  Raddatz testifed.\\n\\nAfter Minor Misunderstanding, A Policy Revoked\\n\\nOne of Barton's constituents, Robin Beaton of Waxahachie, Texas, did know that her health history included acne and a rapid heartbeat. But she didn't think they were relevant to her current health and left them off her application.\\n\\nAfter she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was scheduled for a double mastectomy, her insurer cancelled her policy, leaving her devastated.\\n\\nI had to completely refocus on what to do, where to turn, because my insurance canceled me, she said. Beaton called Barton's office, which started a series of phone calls to her insurer. It took a call from Barton himself to get her reinstated.\\n\\nCommittee investigators found a total of 19,776 rescissions from three large insurers over five years. The rescissions saved the insurers $300 million.\\n\\nInsurers Say They Won't Change Rescission Practice\\n\\nDuring the hearing, Barton asked Hamm how he felt hearing the three cases of people who'd been burned by rescission.\\n\\nI have to say I felt really bad, Hamm replied.\\n\\nIt's my hope there will be changes made that this will no longer be necessary, he said. His hope, and that of the other insurance company CEOs who testified, is that a health care overhaul will mean that everyone has insurance. If that were the case, people couldn't wait until they got sick to apply, and insurers wouldn't have to worry about whether someone had lied on an application.\\n\\nSeveral lawmakers at the hearing suggested there were things the companies could do right now: They could vet applications when they receive them, rather than waiting until people get sick; they could consider whether something that was omitted was related to a current health condition before rescinding; and they could be more careful to positively identify fraud before rescinding a policy.\\n\\nRep. Bart Stupak (D-MI), who chaired the hearing, asked all three CEOs if they would agree to stop rescinding policies except in cases of fraud.\\n\\nAll three said no.\\n\\nIf they don't do something to stop it, said Barton of Texas, Congress will."}
{"original": "Parler Executive Responds To Amazon Cutoff And Defends Approach To Moderation\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hollie Adams/Getty Images Hollie Adams/Getty Images\\n\\nParler calls itself a conservative microblogging alternative to Twitter and the world's premier free speech platform.\\n\\nBut it's been offline for five days, and possibly forever, after Amazon kicked Parler off of its Web hosting service.\\n\\nFounded in 2018, Parler is a favorite of right-wing extremists and supporters of President Trump. It has few restrictions on what users can post, attracting people who say they are being censored by Twitter and Facebook. And it says it collects less data on users than other social media companies.\\n\\nLast weekend, Amazon pulled the plug, saying it found messages on Parler that clearly encourage and incite violence and that Parler's plan to use volunteers to remove this content wouldn't be sufficient.\\n\\nParler filed a lawsuit against Amazon, saying Amazon blindsided the company by abruptly cutting off service and that Amazon never expressed any concerns with Parler's moderation system before last weekend. Amazon responded by saying Parler demonstrated unwillingness and inability to take down content that threatens the public safety, such as by inciting and planning the rape, torture, and assassination of named public officials and private citizens.\\n\\nParler's chief policy officer, Amy Peikoff, says the site's goal is freedom of speech.\\n\\nWe are trying to allow for maximum freedom of expression consistent with the law, she tells NPR's Steve Inskeep.\\n\\nIn an interview on Morning Edition, Peikoff defended Parler's approach, saying the best counter to misinformation is more information. Here are excerpts of the interview:\\n\\nWhat responsibility, if any, does Parler take for the content on your site?\\n\\nOur community guidelines were clear that we would not knowingly tolerate criminal activity on the site. We were trying to avoid using a system in which we would scan every piece of content with an automated algorithm. And so what we had was a community jury system in which any person on Parler could, of course, report a piece of content. We had a reporting mechanism. The report goes into a jury portal and we had a bunch of volunteer jurors who were adjudicating these cases. And then the verdicts would come down, the content would get removed as appropriate.\\n\\nWe should be frank that a lot of people migrated to Parler because they felt they could not lie as freely as they wanted to on the other social media platforms.\\n\\nI wouldn't put it that way. I wouldn't put it that way. Not because they said they want to lie. Now, maybe there are some people, of course, we've had some people come over who were bad actors and then would just tell all kinds of lies and everything else. I think everybody's got that. But people came over, some of them, not all of them, but some of them came over because they thought that they were being treated disproportionately unfairly on other sites and then, yeah, did come over.\\n\\nDo you take as a company any responsibility for not just calls for violence, but just obvious inciting lies about a stolen election?\\n\\nNo, you know, I don't think that lies in and of themselves are inciting. So within a certain context, you could say that certain lies are. We could talk about, for example, whether that one speech that President Trump gave while the events at the Capitol were still going on. And, you know, whereas he ended the speech with, go home in peace. But a lot of us found it not very convincing, given all of the preamble at the beginning.\\n\\nYou could say, OK, in that context, he's telling certain lies and that that could be seen as a further incitement given the ongoing activities on the ground of the day. So I see what you're getting at. But in terms of just lies themselves, and can you say that lies themselves are inciting in the real world? No, when you're dealing with misinformation we think the best [antidote] is more information.\\n\\nIn Amazon's response to your company's lawsuit, they quote a number of posts on Parler. ... There are specific calls to violence, calls for a civil war starting on Inauguration Day, urging people to form militias, urging people to shoot the police, urging people to hang specific public officials. This is just a partial list. When you read that list and know that it came across to people on your company, what do you think about?\\n\\nI mean, I don't want it there, obviously. But again, the question is, what mechanism do you use to detect and then remove that content? And the model that we had, as I said, as time went on through November and into December, when we started making these changes, we realized that we need to do more. And we were making those changes and we were in discussions up with Amazon.\\n\\nThey dropped this on us on Friday afternoon and we were telling them what we were doing and that we were willing to do more. And we were starting even to program a bit of A.I. to figure out how we could use A.I. consistent with our mission over the weekend. And we'd started tagging some content that way. So we're definitely amenable to this. Nobody wants this on their platform.\\n\\nThere is plenty of this content, or at least there was, on Facebook and Twitter as well. All of them. And you know, and I've heard from ex-policy people from other platforms saying that the challenges are everywhere. Even when you do use A.I., it's not going to be 100% perfect.\\n\\nNo, we don't like to see it. It expressly violates our guidelines. And then the challenge is how best effectively to remove it and to make sure that our platform is designed not to encourage the sorts of sentiments that would lead to that type of content being posted in the first place.\\n\\nEditor's note: Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters.\\n\\nJan Johnson and Danny Hajek produced and edited the audio interview."}

Instead of the systems today — where you wait until something bad happens, and again, the only intervention at that point you have is punitive — we're focusing on, Can I detect these things early? And if I can detect them early, can I direct intervention to them — training, counseling. ...\\n\\nStress is a big indicator there. For example, if you are an officer and you have been ... responding to a lot of domestic abuse cases or suicide cases, that is a big predictor of you being involved in an adverse incident in the near future.\\n\\nOn the limits of data analytics\\n\\nWe often work with historical data, which means if the data was collected under some sort of a biased process — so if people are giving loans and they're biased in who they give loans to. Or if people have been collecting data on police misconduct ... and if it was really hard to complain about police misconduct, then you're not going to have the right level of data — you'll only have data from people who really, really, really wanted to come and complain.\\n\\nIf you use those to build your algorithms, what happens is that the computer finds more of only those types of things. So your future predictions will be extremely biased. So we spend a lot of time thinking about, how do we detect that bias, and then how do we correct for that bias so we don't make the wrong decisions?\\n\\nOn using data to improve policy\\n\\nA lot of the work that we've focused on is taking place where organizations are already taking certain actions — those actions just aren't targeted and they aren't effective.\\n\\nSo, after-school programs to keep kids ... helping them graduate from school on time; lead inspections to prevent lead poisoning; interventions the police departments already have. We're working with Cincinnati right now to help them optimize their EMS dispatches so they don't over- or underdispatch something, and help people from that. ...\\n\\nWe're working with the city of Syracuse on problems around, can I predict breaks in the water mains, water pipes? So they can start doing preventative maintenance on those things instead of going afterwards and finding a water main break and fixing it later. ...\\n\\nWhat we believe is the role of data analytics is to help do a lot of early warning systems, to help do a lot of preventative things, to help allocate resources more effectively, and to sort of help improve policy in a much more evidence-based way than we've been doing before."}
{"original": "Chicago Police Are Reducing Stops During COVID-19. Activists Want Even Fewer.\\n\\ntoggle caption Tyler LaRiviere/Chicago Sun-Times via AP, Pool\\n\\nChicago Interim Police Superintendent Charlie Beck said he's instructed officers to slow down the number of stops and arrests they make to reduce contact between citizens and police and slow the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nAt a press conference Tuesday, Beck said there had been significant reduction in traffic stops and pedestrian stops during the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nNormally as a chief, that would upset me. But in this case, it tells me [officers] are doing exactly what we're asking them, Beck said.\\n\\nThe superintendent's comments come as a coalition of civil rights organizations and community groups are pushing for the Chicago Police Department to stop making arrests and other stops except when there is a clear and present danger of imminent physical harm.\\n\\nThe group sent a letter to city attorneys on Monday asking for a meeting to discuss policing policy during the COVID-19 outbreak.\\n\\nEach stop presents a risk of COVID-19 passing between the officer and the person stopped. If just one officer is infected and showing no symptoms, they could spread the virus to dozens of families in just one day through a series of stops for misdemeanors, the letter reads.\\n\\nIn his comments Tuesday, Beck acknowledged the risks posed by making arrests, and said he had instructed officers to issue tickets for a certain level of misdemeanor[s], rather than arresting people.\\n\\nDon't bring them to the station, don't put them into the system, Beck said.\\n\\nSheila Bedi, a clinical law professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law and one of the authors of this week's letter, said it was encouraging to hear Beck talk about the dangers of arresting people.\\n\\nThere's no way to social distance during an arrest, Bedi said.\\n\\nBedi represents a collection of organizations who were given an oversight role in Chicago's court-mandated police reform efforts. She said her clients believe that during the coronavirus crisis, the department should be treating arrests as a last resort.\\n\\nIt sounds like we're not there yet, but perhaps there's a possibility of getting there, she said.\\n\\nSome officers, who spoke with WBEZ on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, said they were already limiting their interactions with the public as much as possible, and only making stops when absolutely necessary.\\n\\nMonday's letter also raised concerns about CPD being tasked with enforcing Ill. Gov. JB Pritzker's stay at home order.\\n\\nIf police are empowered to stop, frisk and detain anyone outside of their home, many people will be subject to unconstitutional stops. CPD's enforcement of shelter in place orders not only leaves communities vulnerable to policing abuse, but it also places CPD officers and community members at risk of infection and contagion, the letter reads.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Beck said officers had not made any arrests or given out any tickets for violation of Pritzker's order, which went into effect on Saturday evening.\\n\\nHe said his instructions to officers enforcing the stay at home order has been to give three warnings and then call a supervisor before any arrests are made or tickets are given out.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that we don't want to arrest people for doing things that before last week would have been legal unless we absolutely have to, unless we are sure that they understand the severity of the violation that they're committing, Beck said.\\n\\nBedi said her group has not yet gotten a response from the city to its letter, and she said despite Beck's comments Tuesday, it is absolutely important that the city spell out all of its COVID-19 policies and make firm commitments to uphold constitutional policing.\\n\\nRepresentations at a press conference are important, but it really needs to be reduced to writing.\\n\\nPatrick Smith is a reporter on WBEZ's Criminal Justice Desk.

Governor Signs Order That 'Clarifies' Controversial Gender Identity Law\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Screen shot by NPR Screen shot by NPR\\n\\nResponding to criticisms over his state's controversial new law that voids cities' anti-discrimination rules protecting members of the LGBT community, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has issued an executive order that seeks legislation to reinstate the right to sue in state court for discrimination.\\n\\nThe law, HB2, spawned a lawsuit by the ACLU and brought cancellations of high-profile events that were planned to take place in North Carolina — everything from a Bruce Springsteen concert to an expansion by PayPal.\\n\\nThe governor said he is acting to protect the privacy and equality of all North Carolinians, by both clarifying the law and adding new protections.\\n\\nI have come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of misinformation, misinterpretation, confusion, a lot of passion and frankly, selective outrage and hypocrisy, especially against the great state of North Carolina, McCrory said in a video address Tuesday, citing feedback about the law.\\n\\nThe North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is calling McCrory's order a poor effort to save face, with Acting Executive Director Sarah Preston saying that the governor's actions fall far short of correcting the damage done by the measure. She added that legal protections are still lacking and that transgender people are still explicitly targeted by being forced to use the wrong restroom.\\n\\nNorth Carolina State Senate Democratic Leader Dan Blue also condemned the governor's clarification, calling it an attempt to put a Band-Aid on a fatal wound.\\n\\nEvery word of this bill needs to be off the books, he said. From restoring the right to sue for employment discrimination at the state level to reaffirming local governing boards' authority to act in the best interest of their communities.\\n\\nAfter the legislation was passed, Attorney General Roy Cooper refused to defend it from any challenges, saying, House Bill 2 is unconstitutional. Therefore our office will not represent the defendants in this lawsuit nor future lawsuits.\\n\\nThe governor's move comes one day after competing rallies were held over the legislation at the state Capitol, with hundreds of demonstrators voicing their support for McCrory and the law and dozens of counterprotesters calling the law a disgrace, according to member station WUNC.\\n\\nAnnouncing his signing of Executive Order 93 Tuesday, McCrory said in a videotaped address that his order maintains common sense gender-specific restroom and locker room facilities in government buildings and schools while also affirming the private sector's right to establish its own policies.\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nMcCrory said that his order expands North Carolina's equal employment opportunity policy to include sexual orientation and gender identity.\\n\\nThe governor also called the city of Charlotte's measure that sought to protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination a solution in search of a problem and a case of government overreach.\\n\\nThe state legislation voiding that measure was adopted in a special session — and signed by McCrory on March 24, a week before Charlotte's law was set to take effect.\\n\\nAs Camila wrote for the Two-Way at the time, The most controversial element of Charlotte's expanded ordinance was the fact that it would allow trans people to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.\\n\\nNews from the North Carolina governor's office that he had signed an executive order that clarifies existing state law echoes some of the same language used in a similar case last year, when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said he supported efforts to clarify the intent of a new law allowing businesses to cite religious objections as grounds to refuse to offer services to gay people.\\n\\nDays later, lawmakers in both Indiana and Arkansas (which had a similar law) approved changes to laws that were called religious freedom bills by their supporters and deemed discriminatory attacks on rights by their opponents."}
{"original": "In A Historic First, Trump Visits Old City Of Jerusalem\\n\\nWashington Post via YouTube\\n\\nUpdated at 2:15 p.m. ET\\n\\nIn a visit fraught with symbolism, President Trump on Monday became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in the Old City of Jerusalem.\\n\\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and resurrection, and the Western Wall, part of the Jewish temple complex destroyed by Rome in 70 C.E.\\n\\nThe walled Old City lies in East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the Six-Day War 50 years ago. Israel's subsequent annexation of East Jerusalem is not recognized internationally.\\n\\nThe White House said the visit was unofficial and private. The U.S. considers the status of Jerusalem unresolved and subject to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not accompany the president to the Old City.\\n\\nNonetheless, Trump's visit — and particularly his brief stop at the Western Wall, Judaism's most revered religious site — carried profound significance.\\n\\nTrump said in joint remarks with Netanyahu later Monday that he was deeply moved by the experience. It will leave an impression on me forever. Netanyahu said the Israeli people applaud the U.S. president for making the trip.\\n\\nAccording to the White House, the visit affirmed the theme of Trump's first overseas trip, promoting unity and peace among the three Abrahamic faiths. The president stopped first in Saudi Arabia, home of Islam's most sacred sites. Wednesday he is scheduled to visit Pope Francis in Vatican City.\\n\\nBut when it comes to the Western Wall, real estate plays as large a role as religious faith.\\n\\nIsraelis celebrate the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 as a national holiday. Its 50th anniversary, according to the Jewish calendar, begins on Tuesday night, just hours after Trump leaves Israel.\\n\\nThe Wall sits at the base of a plateau which Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. Since the 7th century C.E. it has been the site of Islam's Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Trump did not visit the Muslim sites above the Western Wall.\\n\\nTrump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are observant Jews, joined the president and his wife. The chief rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinovich and his wife Yael, greeted them.\\n\\nIn accordance with traditional Jewish religious practice — in which men and women sit separately during prayer — Trump's wife and daughter went to the women's section with the rabbi's wife.\\n\\nOn the men's side, Trump approached the Wall alone, rested the palm of his hand on it and stood silently for about 15 seconds. He placed a note between the massive stones, a centuries-old tradition of supplication.\\n\\nIsraeli security closed off much of the normally bustling Old City in advance of Trump's visit. A large temporary security screen blocked views of the Western Wall.\\n\\nMany Israelis remarked that the president's visit implicitly affirmed Israel's claim to the site, though Trump has made no public statement to that effect.\\n\\nIn their press conference, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their plans to work together. We understand each other, Netanyahu said, thanking Trump for the change in American policy on Iran and the reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East.\\n\\nReferencing his earlier visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump said he believed a new level of partnership is possible in the Middle East.\\n\\nThis includes a renewed effort at peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. ... I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling that we're going to get there eventually, he said. I hope."}
{"original": "5 Things To Watch As GOP Health Bill Moves To The Senate\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eric Thayer/Getty Images\\n\\nAfter weeks of will-they-or-won't-they tensions, the House managed to pass its GOP replacement for the Affordable Care Act on Thursday by a razor-thin margin. The vote was 217-213.\\n\\nDemocrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. As the Republicans reached a majority for the bill, Democrats on the House floor began chanting, Na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. They say Republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.\\n\\nNow the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the Capitol to the Senate. And the job doesn't get any easier. With only a two-vote Republican majority and likely no Democratic support, it would take only three GOP no votes to sink the bill.\\n\\nDemocrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. Trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of Americans and break the bank for millions more, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\\n\\nIt's The Senate's Turn House passage of the American Health Care Act is just a first step. As this measure moves to the Senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. Among them: MEDICAID: The House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. Some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.\\n\\nThe House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965.

Others, however, describe these credits as Obamacare Lite.\\n\\nSome GOP senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. Others, however, describe these credits as Obamacare Lite. PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING: The House would defund this reproductive health organization for a year — a step that draws opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans.\\n\\nAnd Republicans in the Senate have their own internal disagreements, too.\\n\\nHere are five of the biggest flashpoints that could make trouble for the bill in the Senate.\\n\\nMedicaid\\n\\nHouse leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent House debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.\\n\\nFor the first time, federal funding for low-income people on Medicaid would be limited, resulting in what House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative National Review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. It's a longtime goal for many conservatives. We've been dreaming of this since I've been around, Ryan said.\\n\\nBut it is not a consensus position in the party. Some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. In addition, many GOP governors took the federal government's offer in the ACA of near-complete federal funding to expand Medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.\\n\\nThe House bill, wrote the Republican governors of Ohio, Michigan, Arkansas and Nevada in a letter to House and Senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.\\n\\nThat pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some GOP senators. Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Bill Cassidy, R-La.; and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the House bill, as has Dean Heller, R-Nev., It's not clear whether any of the House changes have satisfied those senators.\\n\\nIncrease in number of uninsured people\\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more Americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many Senate lawmakers. You can't sugarcoat it, Cassidy told Fox News when explaining that it's an awful score. The final House bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.\\n\\nAnd Democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the House or the Senate to stop the bill or change it.\\n\\nThe CBO's estimate makes clear that Trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of American families, said Schumer. Tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.\\n\\nTax credits\\n\\nOn one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by House leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the Affordable Care Act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. The CBO estimated that under the original version of the House bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.\\n\\nThat brought a strong rebuke from the powerful AARP, which was an outspoken ACA supporter. Although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.\\n\\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has said she could not support the House bill in its original form because of concerns about the effects on older constituents.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some conservatives in the Senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the ACA, with Paul referring to it as Obamacare Lite. They worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.\\n\\nFor me, it's a big stumbling block still that there's taxpayer money that's being given to insurance companies, Paul told reporters in late April. And I'm just not in favor of taxpayer money going to insurance companies.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood\\n\\nAs Republicans have been vowing for years, the House-passed bill would defund Planned Parenthood, although only for a year. That's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the CBO, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for Medicaid. Birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.\\n\\nBut while cutting funding for Planned Parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the House, there are a handful of GOP senators, including Collins and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.\\n\\nProcedural problems\\n\\nThe budget process Republicans are using to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. It will be up to the Senate parliamentarian, a Republican appointee, to make those determinations.\\n\\nThat's why the bill does not wipe away all the ACA's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.\\n\\nSome analysts have suggested that the House amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the Senate's Byrd Rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.\\n\\nIt could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in a blog post.\\n\\nEven Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who negotiated that amendment that won the backing of conservatives, conceded that it could prove problematic in the Senate. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done before we can celebrate and all go home, he said in an interview outside the House chamber.\\n\\nDemocrats say it is one of several provisions in the House bill that might not pass parliamentary muster in the Senate.\\n\\nFor example, analysts have suggested that the GOP replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass Byrd Rule scrutiny either. That's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.\\n\\nA third potentially problematic element of the original House bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the Affordable Care Act. That provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.

Foreign policy analyst Ali Ahmadi, political analyst explains.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nFriday was the first day of spring, which marks the start of the new year for Iranians. Norooz, which means new day, is the biggest holiday of the Iranian calendar. The celebrations last for almost two weeks. People have family gatherings. Some people even jump over bonfires. But this Norooz, Iran is in the grip of a major coronavirus outbreak. Ali Ahmadi, a foreign policy analyst, joins us on the line from Tehran. Thank you so much for being with us.\\n\\nALI AHMADI: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nSIMON: This is meant to be a time of hope and celebration, but these are hard times for Iranians, aren't they?\\n\\nAHMADI: Yes. So we've had over 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases. It's very much possible, as many public health officials inside and outside the country said, that it's actually significantly higher. When you see all that anxiety on with - from friends and family on Slack channels and WhatsApp groups, that's one thing. When you go outside, it's surprising the extent to which the street looks normal. It's definitely not normal. People are trying to stay in, but there is much more activity than you'd expect. Some of that is a bit deceptive because public transportation is essentially not being used right now. Iran has a decent subway system and buses that are - people do not really trust them right now, so they're driving in their cars. But it is - there are a lot more people out and about than one would expect.\\n\\nSIMON: Are people not visiting each other at this time of year when families like to get together, do you think?\\n\\nAHMADI: That's exactly what you do on Norooz - is you visit relatives. Families go to each other, extended - you visit extended family. There are definitely people still doing that, unfortunately.\\n\\nSIMON: Mr. Ahmadi, you mentioned the health care crisis. How much of that crisis in one way or another might trace back to the world's sanctions?\\n\\nAHMADI: A lot of it. I mean a lot of health care systems right now are under stress. Iran actually has a pretty good health care system. Its quality, its accessibility is very good. That may have created some of the initial overconfidence about being able to stop this thing. But the sanctions are absolutely a major factor. Iran, because of the sanctions, can't buy pharmaceuticals or medical devices like ventilators, so it's absolutely taking a huge toll, and it is definitely killing people.\\n\\nSIMON: This has been a hard period for Iran in particular. You had the forces that shot down a passenger plane, protesters denouncing what they saw as a cover-up in a battered economy. It's the oldest question in journalism, but what's the mood on the streets?\\n\\nAHMADI: Definitely not good, but people right now are just focusing on dealing with the coronavirus issue. So morale is certainly down, but nothing in particular is going to change - nothing in particular is going to be altered in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nSIMON: May I ask, Mr. Ahmadi, how are you marking the holiday?\\n\\nAHMADI: I am marking the holiday at home and completely by myself (laughter). I - my parents invited me to come to their house, and I told them that that's probably a bad idea in case, you know, I have it, and I'm not symptomatic. You know, my parents are a little bit older. And older people are a little bit more vulnerable to this thing.\\n\\nSIMON: Do you have any wishes for the new year? Have you heard wishes from other Iranians?\\n\\nAHMADI: I think people want to have a moment to take a breath. I'm sure they could do without, you know, the saber-rattling and the sanctions and all of that. But ultimately, I think people are - just want a moment with their families.\\n\\nSIMON: Ali Ahmadi, foreign policy analyst speaking with us from Tehran.

{"original": "Former National Security Official On Repercussions Of Soleimani Strike\\n\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\\n\\nKelly Magsamen has served in a variety of national security positions and is currently vice president for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress. She joins us now on the line. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nKELLY MAGSAMEN: Good to be here.\\n\\nFADEL: So now, you worked on the Iran portfolio for years at the National Security Council under two very different presidents. Soleimani has been on your radar that whole time. Reportedly, both administrations considered this course of action and dismissed it. Why?\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: Well, listen; I think, you know, the real question is whether or not taking this step would've made Americans more or less safe. And I think there's real questions right now about whether or not President Trump's decision is actually going to leave Americans more vulnerable.\\n\\nFADEL: Is there a precedent for direct action against a state actor? Normally, we're used to seeing these kinds of moves through proxies by both the U.S. and Iran, really.\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: This is pretty unprecedented. I expect - you know, this is not like killing just a terrorist group leader. This is, you know, killing the head of a state government apparatus - security apparatus. So the implications of this go well beyond just sort of traditional killing of terrorists globally.\\n\\nFADEL: According to President Trump, Soleimani was, quote, planning a very major attack. But the administration hasn't really provided evidence of that claim. The invasion of Iraq was also - was predicted on faulty intelligence. How does this strike - when you hear it, how does it strike you based on the history?\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: Well, I think the administration has a pretty high bar to climb in terms of, you know, providing information to the Congress, to the American public that there was, indeed, a very imminent attack. Now, of course, that's what the administration says. But I think in the coming days, they're going to have to - essentially, the intelligence community's going to have to go brief the Congress and make sure they understand the implications. But, certainly, you know, in the past, given the Iraq War experience, I think there is a lot of skepticism around U.S. intelligence.\\n\\nFADEL: You've tweeted, conventional deterrence moves against an asymmetric actor like Iran will have limited utility on deterrence. Trump has added more than 14,000 troops since May. It didn't prevent the current situation. So if conventional deterrence doesn't work, what should the U.S. be doing?\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: Well, I think right now, the most important thing for the United States to be doing is working very hard to ensure that U.S. personnel in diplomatic posts globally are safe. And that's going to require a lot of working with our allies, sharing intelligence, hardening of embassies, potentially drawing down more vulnerable posts. So a number of moves are going to - defensive moves are going to have to be made globally because I think this is going to potentially - Iran's reaction could potentially extend well beyond the Middle East.\\n\\nFADEL: Given the maximum pressure campaign that has crippled its economy, the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and now this assassination, what incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the U.S. now?\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: Well, I think right now, there's - the likelihood of the Iranians coming to the table is pretty low. I do think they're going to have to respond, you know, mainly for their own internal politics reasons. But, you know, certainly, I think the administration needs to evaluate whether or not its maximum pressure approach is actually working. I think the evidence is now showing that it's actually not working. It's actually making the region much more unstable. So I think the administration now has to sort of step back from this and say, what is our goal? What are we trying to achieve here? And are we actually deploying the right tools to get there?\\n\\nFADEL: Given the situation right now, what do you hope is being discussed by the national security apparatus?\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: Well, right now, I'm hoping that they're going through very extensive contingency planning for the range of Iranian responses. I mean, we could see everything from cyberattacks to kidnapping or killing of U.S. officials to attacks on additional embassies. So hopefully, right now they're in crisis response mode and doing the proper preparations. But I also hope that they're thinking the long term, what they're actually trying to achieve through their Iran policy and adjusting course.\\n\\nFADEL: Kelly Magsamen of the Center for American Progress, thanks for speaking with us.\\n\\nMAGSAMEN: You're welcome.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

A federal judge and independent monitor, named today, will oversee the changes to make sure they comply with agreed-to guidelines.\\n\\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson said he welcomes the changes.\\n\\nWe say bring it on and let's get down to business.\\n\\nWe've known about this consent decree for the last 2 years, so we're prepared mentally to have to deal with it, Johnson said. Matter of fact, the consent decree will make us better. We say bring it on and let's get down to business.\\n\\nNearly four years ago, the city was embroiled in controversy over a police video. That video, withheld from the public for more than a year, was released and shows a white police officer fatally shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who is black. McDonald, a knife in his hand, appeared to be walking away from police.\\n\\nThe 2014 shooting and handling of the case became a rallying cry for activists. It also led to the trial and conviction of Jason Van Dyke, the officer who shot McDonald.\\n\\nBetween the shooting and the Department of Justice report, the department knew change would come. The withering DOJ report — issued in January of 2017 — called the Chicago Police Department's use of force excessive and racially discriminatory. Soon afterward, Chicago police issued a new use-of-force policy emphasizing the sanctity of life, and started holding training sessions for officers.\\n\\nUnder the consent decree, there are many more changes in store. For example, the Department must produce a monthly report about use of force incidents; it bans police from using Tasers on people who are simply running away. The agreement also expands mental health services for police, including a initiative for suicide prevention — a big concern recently after a rash of police suicides.\\n\\nOn a day when we marked a 44 percent decrease in homicides and a 24 percent reduction in shootings, today's data and today's agreement capture the new direction of the Chicago Police Department, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. This agreement, which is the result of the changes we sought and agreed to, will ensure a better city, a better CPD, and safer streets.\\n\\nFederal oversight in St. Louis, Seattle\\n\\nChicago is among 14 other law enforcement agencies in the country under federal oversight. Among them, the police department in Ferguson, Mo. A fatal police shooting there sparked nationwide protests and helped spur the Black Lives Matter movement.\\n\\nActivist Felicia Pulliam says progress in St. Louis under the consent decree is mixed.\\n\\nYou know, I'm going to have to say, that I've seen some incidents of improvement, Pulliam said. There's a lot of resistance to a new practice of policing, a new way of policing the community from some police officers.\\n\\nIt's a different story for Seattle, says Mayor Jenny Durkan. After six and a half years of oversight, a federal judge said, in January, that Seattle's police department was in compliance.\\n\\nWe still have a disproportionate amount of force being used against people of color that we feel we need to look at more carefully, but there has been a sea and cultural change, Durkan said.\\n\\nRichard O'Neil, with Seattle's police union, remains critical of the decree and says it has damaged morale.\\n\\nWell, It was very frustrating from the beginning, he said. The incentive to get out and be a proactive officer I think has been damaged and, something the city can't deny anymore, that we have [taken] a real hit in recruiting, retaining officers.\\n\\nThere are very specific ways that police in Chicago abuse their power.\\n\\nRecruitment is a problem nationwide, even in departments without decrees. But the feelings of mistrust is something Chicago will have to deal with. Chicago officials and community activists say they've studied the consent decrees in other cities.\\n\\nSheila Bedi is an attorney with the MacArthur Justice Center. She represented activists and community groups in a successful fight to allow them to have a direct say in overseeing the court ordered reforms. She says that's different from other consent decrees: There are very specific ways that police in Chicago abuse their power, Bedi said, and it was critical that this consent decree couldn't just be imported from Seattle, for example. That it really addressed the particular harm that Chicago communities face.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe federal judge overseeing Chicago's police reform plan, Robert Dow Jr., says it's an important step in the city's ongoing effort to repair the damaged relationship between police and residents. Dow appointed a team of monitors on Friay who will ensure the department meets certain benchmarks.\\n\\nHe says the overall effort is no magic wand, but it is a beginning."}

It's also unclear whether the 75 percent statistic includes more minor crimes than the examples listed.\\n\\nThe raids prompted an outcry from immigrant rights advocates, concerned about the scale and synchronization of the raids — which they described as unusual, despite ICE's characterizations of the operations as routine — and by shifts in practice compared with previous ICE operations.\\n\\nFor instance, last week's ICE arrests included collateral damage, or people who were picked up despite not being targeted in the operations — because, for example, they were in the same place as a person who was targeted, and did not have documentation.\\n\\nIndividuals swept up in this way are presumably among the quarter of those arrested that Kelly did not identify as having a criminal conviction.\\n\\nImmigration activists had also expressed concern over what kinds of crimes could lead a person to be a target for deportation. Kelly's statement notes that some of the people arrested had convictions for serious crimes such as homicide and sexual assault, but it's not clear how many of the arrests were for those crimes and how many for crimes such as drunken driving.\\n\\nPresident Trump's executive order on the deportation of criminal aliens allows a person to be targeted for deportation over any crime. It's unclear from Kelly's statement whether any lower-level crimes like immigration offenses are included in the 75 percent tally.\\n\\nJoseph Villela, the director of policy at the immigrant rights group CHIRLA, told NPR on Sunday night that his organization had reports of people being arrested in the raids who would not have been prioritized for deportation before.\\n\\nThere were individuals that had, first, no criminal conviction — second, maybe a minor conviction — but third, some of them had a previous deportation order and that was what made them a priority, he said. This is a shift that reflected [President Trump's] executive order.'\\n\\nVillela said there was a lack of transparency from ICE officials about how many people were affected by the raids, and that at one point CHIRLA's legal team received false information about a client's whereabouts.\\n\\nHe described a deficit of trust between advocacy groups and the enforcement agency.\\n\\nForgive us for not believing 100 percent of what [ICE] are saying when in the field ... they were not forthcoming in regards to the real numbers of individuals that were affected, he said.\\n\\nWhile Trump has characterized the raids as fulfilling a campaign pledge to deport criminals in the country illegally, immigration officials have maintained that the series of actions were just business as usual — in some cases, saying the operations were planned months in advance.\\n\\nThat discrepancy continued on Monday. During a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump praised Kelly and said the raids were fulfilling a campaign promise.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kelly characterized the raids as consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has also said that in deporting people in the country illegally, the focus is on threats to national security and public safety.\\n\\nThe statement from Kelly characterized recent arrests using slightly different terms. The 680 individuals arrested pose a threat to public safety, border security or the integrity of our nation's immigration system, he wrote."}

The Obama White House also maintained the prerogative not to release records of particularly 'sensitive' meetings, such as interviews with potential Supreme Court nominees.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that during Obama's presidency, Trump questioned his transparency and once wondered whether Obama might be hiding something by not releasing records.\\n\\nWhy does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition?

{"original": "The Erie Canal As A Model Of How To Build Big Projects Again\\n\\nEditor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Philip Meeder (1826)/New York Public Library Philip Meeder (1826)/New York Public Library\\n\\nIn 1809, representatives from the state of New York traveled to the nation's capital to meet with President Thomas Jefferson. They wanted money for a 363-mile canal that would link Lake Erie with the Hudson River, thereby opening up New York City to a funnel of commerce from the developing American West. In an age before bulldozers and chainsaws, building an artificial waterway through untamed wilderness, mountains and rocky cliffs was audacious.\\n\\nJefferson had come to office promising federal spending on infrastructure, so canal supporters had a reason to believe he would pony up. He did not. He declared that the proposal for the Erie Canal was a little short of madness.\\n\\nBut did that stop New York from building it? No! New York decided to go it solo. The state issued bonds and had private investors lend it money for the canal. And in only eight years — with zero financial support from the federal government — New York finished the canal with uproarious celebrations. In October 1825, Dewitt Clinton, the New York governor who had fought for the canal as naysayers called it Clinton's ditch, boarded a boat at Lake Erie with two kegs of lake water. And 10 days later, he poured the water into the Atlantic Ocean after reaching New York City.\\n\\nThe Erie Canal was an immediate success. It unleashed a flood of resources from the West, dramatically increasing the variety of products and slashing consumer prices. New York manufacturers got increased access to markets in the expanding frontier, and New York became the central seaport for global commerce to reach America's heartland. Almost instantly, toll revenue from the canal was nearly five times more than the interest due from the state's bond debt. By 1837, only about a decade after completion, the entire debt was paid off. By the early 1850s, the canal carried over 60% of total U.S. trade.\\n\\nSo what about now?\\n\\nDespite decades of bipartisan calls for more federal investment in infrastructure, federal spending on it has fallen in half over the last 35 years (from about 1% of GDP to 0.5%). It's why local leaders often blame the federal government for their infrastructure problems. But the Erie Canal is a testament to the fact that they don't necessarily need the federal government to pursue big projects.\\n\\nState and local governments currently pay for more than three-quarters of all U.S. infrastructure spending. While the federal government has effectively been stuck in neutral, we've seen states and localities pick up the slack by, in fact, going to the private markets, much like their predecessors did in New York state with the Erie Canal, says Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. The municipal bond market alone, he says, is roughly $4 trillion, and much of that is for infrastructure.\\n\\nBut like federal spending, state and local spending has also declined over the last decade. That's despite an 11% increase in the amount spent on repairs. For the most part, public infrastructure investment has shifted to upkeep, on what we've already built, Tomer says.\\n\\nTomer believes the shift to operation and maintenance — as opposed to transformative megaprojects like the Erie Canal — is perfectly symbolic of the population and economic era the United States is in. Population and economic growth, for the most part, has stagnated.\\n\\nThe decline in shiny, new infrastructure projects is also the result of the types of technologies coming online. Many, such as electric and autonomous vehicles or digital platform systems that improve traffic, simply build on existing infrastructure.\\n\\nIt's in our DNA in the United States — whether it's the Erie Canal or the transcontinental railroad or the interstate highway system — to want a megaproject, Tomer says. The question today is what actually is a megaproject for this new era.\\n\\nWhile there's broad agreement that we need more investment in infrastructure, there is not broad agreement on what kind. The left wants a Green New Deal that will liberate the United States from fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change, and much of that would involve big changes in infrastructure, from massive investment in high-speed rail to a more efficient electrical grid.\\n\\nSome megaprojects are in the works, including a new railway connecting Miami and Orlando, Fla. — but so far the sexiest ones have stalled. Take, for instance, the proposed bullet train between San Francisco and Los Angeles. It's a fiasco. It has received billions of dollars in both state and federal funding, yet — in more time than it took to build the entire Erie Canal — there has barely been any progress.\\n\\nBy the end of the 19th century, railroads replaced canals as the primary carrier of goods around the country. But historians agree that the canal helped New York grow to become the powerhouse it remains today. More broadly, it jump-started American industrialization and globalization.

At the same time, the Trump administration is making it harder to hire international workers, so U.S. companies are setting up shop north of the border.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nTrump administration's visa limits restrictions have made it harder to hire high-skilled workers from around the world. That's created an opportunity for other countries, like Canada, which has become a magnet for global talent. To think they'll snag BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music. And some U.S. companies are looking north of the border to fill open jobs, as NPR's Joel Rose reports.\\n\\nJOEL ROSE, BYLINE: More than a dozen hiring managers from tech startups squeeze into a private dining room at Del Posto, a high-end New York restaurant.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF GLASSES CLINKING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Cheers.\\n\\nROSE: One of them is Susan Riskin, the head of human resources at Bitly, which you may have heard of. It's well known for making Web addresses shorter.\\n\\nSUSAN RISKIN: We doubled the size of our technology team in the last year, and we feel like we have exhausted New York and Denver. And now it's like we're trying to figure out where to go next, what we need do.\\n\\nROSE: None of the hiring managers at this table are finding enough qualified people to fill all of their open jobs. They came tonight for the New York strip steak and Italian wine, but also to hear a pitch from this guy.\\n\\nIRFHAN RAWJI: If you'd rather fill a job than go without, call us. We'll open a virtual subsidiary for you in Canada. You get access to the world.\\n\\nROSE: Irfhan Rawji is the founder of a Canadian company called MobSquad. Here's his pitch. Say your firm wants to hire an international tech worker but their visa application is rejected or the application process is dragging on for months. So Rawji says hire them to work for you remotely from Canada.\\n\\nRAWJI: The flights are an hour and a half to two hours. It's the same business culture. And we try to match or beat the total cost for you here.\\n\\nROSE: Not that long ago, U.S. tech companies relied on a steady stream of engineers and software developers from China and India and elsewhere. Meagan Soszynski is the head of HR for an advertising app called Yieldmo. Over dessert, Soszynski says getting what's known as an H-1B visa for those high-skilled workers was often slow and expensive, but at least it was predictable.\\n\\nMEAGAN SOSZYNSKI: You pretty much always got the outcome that you wanted.\\n\\nROSE: Soszynski says that's not the case anymore.\\n\\nSOSZYNSKI: In the last year, I would say every one of my H-1B cases had been met with some sort of delay.\\n\\nROSE: Under the Trump administration, H-1B visas have been harder to come by. The rejection rate for new applicants has tripled in recent years to nearly 25%. Immigration authorities say they're trying to ensure companies follow the rules.

And it is concerning.\\n\\nROSE: But U.S. immigration policy is having unintended consequences in Canada. That country has made it easier for new tech workers to immigrate there. And its tech sector is booming. Now big U.S. tech firms are following global tech workers north of the border. Google, Microsoft, Intel and Uber have either opened or announced plans for new offices in Canada.\\n\\nI met Yung Wu at the MaRS Discovery District, the technology hub he runs in Toronto.\\n\\nYUNG WU: Toronto's now the fastest growing tech city in North America.\\n\\nROSE: Wu says the Toronto tech industry has been growing for a while, but the U.S. immigration crackdown accelerated that growth.\\n\\nWU: Look; every time Trump tweets, we get another sort of injection, which is all good from my perspective.

{"original": "Tourism Worries And Few Takers As More Utah Land Offered For Drilling, Mining\\n\\nThe Trump administration opened lands within the former bounds of two Obama-designated National Monuments for resource extraction, but with low demand and high costs, industry is staying away for now.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nIn late 2017, President Trump downsized two national monuments in Utah. Lawsuits from conservation groups and tribes are still working their way through the courts. This week, the Trump administration finalized plans to expand access for mining and drilling on many of those lands. The area has more than 11 billion tons of coal plus oil, gas and other minerals. But as Nate Hegyi of Mountain West News Bureau reports, industry is wary of digging in and locals are divided on whether it should.\\n\\nNATE HEGYI, BYLINE: Breck Crystal is enjoying the desert sun at a gas station just east of the town of Boulder, right in the heart of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\\n\\nBRECK CRYSTAL: We're in the January thaw right now.\\n\\nHEGYI: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nCrystal is a local rancher and guide who's lived out here since 1996. And he says he welcomes Trump downsizing the monument and calling for more resource development on public lands here.\\n\\nCRYSTAL: To open up for logging, mining, manufacturing that Trump is doing, I think is a healthy thing for this country. It gets people to work with their hands. It gets people to produce things.\\n\\nHEGYI: And this vast expanse of southern Utah's red rock desert could produce a lot.\\n\\nJOHN FREEMUTH: There's coal, coal seams. There's oil and gas. There's some uranium. There's tar sands.\\n\\nHEGYI: John Freemuth is a professor of public lands policy at Boise State University. He says industry has been kicking the tires of Utah's red rock desert for decades. Access to those minerals became available when President Trump drastically reduced the boundaries of both Bear's Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. But in the last two years, big oil, gas and mining companies haven't come in yet. Freemuth says there are a lot of reasons for that.\\n\\nFREEMUTH: Industry is not stupid about the cost of producing things. I think they're pretty, you know - fairly astute on the market. And some of that stuff is deep and harder to get to or expensive to produce.\\n\\nHEGYI: And in some cases, there isn't much of a market demand right now for minerals like coal and uranium. So they may just stay underground. But above ground, another industry has been growing - tourism.\\n\\nNATHAN WAGGONER: Tourism is a - it's a vital part of this community.\\n\\nHEGYI: Nathan Waggoner owns an outdoor gear shop in the town of Escalante. Tourism pumps more than $150 million into the region every year and employs almost half the people who live and work there - most of them in the service industry.\\n\\nWAGGONER: And as people come to enjoy this place, different industries are popping up. And we're seeing, you know - just Main Street has changed the last 15 years. And it's good to see. It's good to see that in a small town in the West.\\n\\nHEGYI: And that's why he's so baffled that the Trump administration would shrink this area's monuments and expand the potential here for mining and drilling. He says that could scare away tourists and damage the pristine nature of this place. It's home to towering canyons, ancient petroglyphs and the clear, shallow Escalante River. It runs 87 miles through the heart of its namesake monument.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLOSHING THROUGH WATER)\\n\\nHEGYI: Jonathan Paklaian, who works for a local environmental nonprofit, likes to come here some days after work.\\n\\nJONATHAN PAKLAIAN: Getting out here for a trail run, it's rejuvenating. And it's kind of like hitting a reset button on your mind.\\n\\nHEGYI: He doesn't want to see this red rock desert become a home for drilling and mining. And he may not have to. If the pending lawsuits by conservation groups and indigenous tribes are successful, the monuments will be restored and off limits to development once again.

Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.\\n\\nThe owners of Beaver Valley nuclear power station in Shippingport, Pa. said they are reversing a decision to shut it down next year, citing a climate policy pushed by Gov. Tom Wolf.\\n\\nAkron, Ohio-based Energy Harbor Corp. said Friday it had notified PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, that it would rescind March 2018 deactivation notices for the two power generating units at the plant, which employs 1,000.\\n\\nThose units were scheduled to permanently shut down in May and October 2021, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\\n\\nBut Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's moves to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program intended to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, appear to have changed the company's course.\\n\\nIn October, Wolf signed an executive order mandating the Department of Environmental Protection to draft a regulation to put the state into RGGI.\\n\\nThe decision to rescind the deactivations for Beaver Valley was largely driven by the efforts of Governor Wolf's administration to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, said Energy Harbor President and Chief Executive Officer John Judge, in an emailed news release.\\n\\nJudge said the state's inclusion into RGGI will begin to help level the playing field for our carbon-free nuclear generators and will help it market carbon free energy to customers. RGGI aims to cut carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change, by requiring polluters to pay for their emissions.\\n\\nThe states in the agreement are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Jersey. Virginia just passed a law that paves the way for it to join.\\n\\nRepublicans in the state House and Senate have questioned the legality of Wolf's order, and said they could try to block the plan. Judge signaled that could trip up the company's plans.\\n\\nWe are excited about the RGGI process implementation in early 2022 but would need to revisit deactivation if RGGI does not come to fruition as expected, he said.\\n\\nIn a statement, Wolf said the decision was very encouraging as his administration prepares to draft the regulation to enroll the state in RGGI.\\n\\nClimate change is the most critical environmental threat confronting the world and demands a multifaceted approach, Wolf said. Reducing emissions and maintaining existing clean energy resources are primary components in the fight to address climate change, and energy companies like Energy Harbor recognize this.\\n\\nThe announcement is a reversal of fortunes for the 1,872-megawatt Beaver Valley plant. In 2018, FirstEnergy Solutions, its previous owner, filed for bankruptcy and announced the plant would begin deactivation by 2021. At the time, the company cited steep competition from cheap natural gas.\\n\\nThe company then sought federal and state bailouts for its coal and nuclear plants. A federal bailout didn't happen, but the company did score a $150 million-a-year ratepayer bailout in Ohio for its plants there.\\n\\nEnergy Harbor emerged out of the FirstEnergy Solutions bankruptcy last month as the new owner of Beaver Valley. Its announcement was a pleasant surprise for State Rep. Rob Matzie, a Beaver County Democrat who had tried unsuccessfully to get a bill that would have propped up nuclear power to pass the Pennsylvania legislature. The state's Public Utility Commission had estimated the measure would cost ratepayers $458.9 million to $551 million a year.\\n\\nIt's a big deal, said Matzie. It stops the clock ticking. You know, they were talking of needing to make a decision by the end of summer whether to stay open or closed. So it gives us a little bit more time.\\n\\nEditor's Picks"}

Something else also has happened since then: Trump ordered U.S. Navy warships on the other side of the world to attack a Syrian airfield after warplanes based there used chemical weapons in an airstrike that killed scores of people in Idlib, including children.\\n\\nTrump's choice to launch that missile strike was a surprise about-face after administration officials appeared to take the heat off Syria's president, Bashar Assad, saying the U.S. would scrap its previous position that Assad could no longer govern. As the world continues watching to see whether Trump's attack was a one-time outing designed to send a message — or the first shot in a new war against Assad's regime — North Korea's regime has new reason for pause.\\n\\nOr so Washington hopes.\\n\\nNorth Korea is looking for trouble, Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.\\n\\nThe president's warning followed tough talk over the weekend by other administration leaders.\\n\\nThis is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime, and President Xi and President Trump agreed that that is unacceptable, national security adviser H.R. McMaster said on Fox News Sunday. The president has asked us to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat to the American people and to our allies and partners in the region.\\n\\nAnd before that, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that all options are on the table as the Trump administration calculates how to deal with the threats North Korea poses to its neighbors and, potentially, the United States.\\n\\nIn practical terms, however, Trump and his aides may be able to do less than they did in Syria. In that case, Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two Navy destroyers destroyed Syrian warplanes, air defense systems, fuel and other supplies. But nothing similar is likely from the Carl Vinson or its escorts — in fact, if any shots are fired it could be the start of a serious major conflict.\\n\\nIn Syria, the United States could hit a target with a low chance of it striking back, in the midst of a conflict that's already been raging for years. In Korea, Kim Jong Un has many potential ways to respond quickly and savagely by lashing out at a close U.S. ally, South Korea, which hosts nearly 30,000 U.S. troops to help defend it.\\n\\nThat means the Navy can't change the conversation by hitting North Korea with a few cruise missiles the way it did in Syria. North and South Korea have tens of thousands of troops and huge arsenals pointed at each other on each side of the demilitarized zone that separates them. Occasional flare-ups since the armistice in 1953 have claimed some lives, but the peninsula hasn't seen major combat.\\n\\nThe stakes, however, are higher than they've ever been: North Korea is building nuclear weapons and marching toward the ability to fit them atop its ballistic missiles. That means it could hit South Korea; another archenemy, Japan; or potentially even the continental United States in a few years.\\n\\nNorth Korea says that it would respond to any military action by ordering a full retaliation, putting millions of lives in immediate danger. Pyongyang has further compounded the problem by deploying its ballistic missiles on mobile launchers. If a crisis reached a flashpoint, North Korea watchers say there's no guarantee the U.S. military could find and destroy all the missiles quickly enough to stop a launch.\\n\\nThere's also no telling how North Korea's youthful strongman, Kim Jong Un, might respond to a serious military crisis, or how brittle his regime might prove. If Kim and his top aides were killed in a U.S. attempt to decapitate North Korea before it could order a ballistic attack, that might cause the whole government to collapse.\\n\\nNorth Korea's patron, China, which supplies much of its food and fuel, would not look kindly on any such outcome, or on any military action by the United States. Beijing faulted Trump's attack on Syria after Xi's visit and although the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean peninsula, per the White House, China has given Trump no commitment to rein in Kim.\\n\\nPyongyang, meanwhile, warned of catastrophic consequences if Washington tried to follow up its Syria attack in North Korea.\\n\\nThat's actually a step down from North Korea's rhetoric from the last time the Carl Vinson strike group sailed near the Korean Peninsula, when it said a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier.\\n\\nBut despite all the supercharged rhetoric and intense regional scrutiny, the ships came and went then without incident, the way American warships have for decades. As the Carl Vinson and its escorts make their way north again now, the world is watching to see whether this visit also goes according to routine."}
{"original": "Not My Job: We Quiz The Barefoot Contessa, Ina Garten, On Footwear\\n\\nIn 1978, Garten bought a specialty food store in the Hamptons. That store grew into a career, a series of cookbooks and a popular show on the Food Network. Originally broadcast April 22, 2017.\\n\\nBILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis, and here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\\n\\nThank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. This week, in honor of a holiday that commemorates events of 241 years ago, we figured we'd revel in our achievements from a couple of months ago - mainly when we got some fun people to come on our show and talk to us.\\n\\nKURTIS: First, an unlikely celebrity, Ina Garten, who bought a bakery shop as a second career and became one of the nation's most-beloved TV chefs, the Barefoot Contessa.\\n\\nSAGAL: I asked her about all her early experiences that made her decide to run away and bake cupcakes instead.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nSAGAL: So let's go over the details of your origin story, as if you were a superhero. Was that all true? You used to work in the White House, or at least nearby, right?\\n\\nINA GARTEN: I did - no, I worked in the White House. I worked in the Office of Management and Budget on nuclear energy policy.\\n\\nSAGAL: So were you an enthusiastic cook back then?\\n\\nGARTEN: I was learning how to cook then. I would work at OMB during the day, and I'd go home and cook at night.\\n\\nSAGAL: I've heard that you bought the store called the Barefoot Contessa out in the Hamptons without ever having seen it. Is that right?\\n\\nGARTEN: I actually had seen it. I saw it once. They were baking cookies. And I thought, this is where I need to be (laughter). And I made an offer on the store and went back to my office in Washington thinking, well, that'll never happen. And the owner called me the next day and said, thank you very much, I accept your offer. And I just went, oh, [expletive].\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, tell me about the store. What was the original store like?\\n\\nGARTEN: It was 400 square feet. It was so small that you couldn't get the - the stove didn't fit into the kitchen. So it was actually in the store. If you wanted to put something in the oven, you had to go into the store. And it was great. I mean, I always wanted it to feel like a party. And it did. We had great music and we had samples of cookies out.\\n\\nAnd everybody had a great time. They would come in just to see what was going on.\\n\\nSAGAL: Right. Right. And how long did you own that store?\\n\\nGARTEN: Well, I owned the first store for three years. Then I bought a bigger store. And then I moved to East Hampton to a much bigger store. So the store I owned at the end was 3,000 square feet.\\n\\nSAGAL: Right, OK. And then you started doing your cookbooks once the store became really known.\\n\\nGARTEN: No, actually, after I - I sold the store to employees and then I started doing cookbooks.\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh, really?\\n\\nGARTEN: Yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: You got out of the food business.\\n\\nGARTEN: (Laughter) And into the - out of the frying pan and into the pot or whatever it is.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nFAITH SALIE: Ina, I don't know how to cook. And this is, like, a big stain in my life.\\n\\nGARTEN: Yeah?\\n\\nSALIE: Tell me the...\\n\\nJEFF GARLIN: It'd be a bigger stain if you did cook.\\n\\nMO ROCCA: Yeah.\\n\\nSALIE: Maybe - I mean, tell me the number one thing I need to know to help me start or give me...\\n\\nGARTEN: You know, there's - I make roast chicken. And that is the simplest thing in the world to make. And I met some girls that worked at Glamour magazine, and they said, we call it engagement chicken because every time somebody in the office makes it for their boyfriend, they're engaged within 24 hours.\\n\\nROCCA: Wow.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGARLIN: Ina, your last name is Garten, right?\\n\\nGARTEN: Yes.\\n\\nGARLIN: OK, your husband's name is Jeff Garten?\\n\\nGARTEN: Jeffrey, yes.\\n\\nGARLIN: Jeffrey Garten, I'm Jeffrey Garlin, how are you?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Jeffrey, you're so delighted by that. It's adorable.\\n\\nGARLIN: By the way...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGARLIN: ...My wife, Marla, bought me that cookbook, Cooking For Jeffrey.\\n\\nGARTEN: (Laughter) That's great.\\n\\nGARLIN: But she cooks from it 'cause I can't do that. I only know how to put SpaghettiOs on pizza.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGARLIN: But by the way, your food is delicious.\\n\\nGARTEN: Thank you.\\n\\nGARLIN: Young people love it, old people love it - mostly Jews if they're old people.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nGARLIN: But they love your cooking.\\n\\nSAGAL: Speaking of someone who loves your cooking...\\n\\nGARTEN: Uh-oh.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...What is it like to be in Taylor Swift's posse?\\n\\nGARTEN: In Taylor Swift's - well, I'm not exactly in her posse. But I've spent some - she came for a photo shoot and we made a pavlova together, which was wonderful.\\n\\nSAGAL: I'm sorry, you made a what together?\\n\\nGARTEN: Pavlova, which is meringue and whipped cream and berries.\\n\\nROCCA: Is it like Anna Pavlova?\\n\\nSALIE: Yes...\\n\\nGARTEN: Like Anna Pavlova...\\n\\nSALIE: ...It's named after her.\\n\\nGARTEN: Exactly. It looks like a tutu.\\n\\nROCCA: Oh, Trump thinks she's alive.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes. And I'm assuming just given the way that Taylor Swift looks, after you made it, she looked at it hungrily, then went back to her diet of carrot sticks and cardboard.\\n\\nGARTEN: No, she just dove right in.\\n\\nSAGAL: Did she really?\\n\\nGARTEN: Yeah (laughter).\\n\\nGARLIN: What was she wearing?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Is Taylor Swift a good cook? I don't know.\\n\\nGARTEN: She's a very good cook, yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: Really?\\n\\nGARTEN: She loves to cook.\\n\\nSAGAL: Is there anything she can't do?\\n\\nGARTEN: No, (laughter) not as far as I can see. She's pretty extraordinary.\\n\\nROCCA: Is this true that you went to high school with both Pulitzer Prize-winner James Lapine and a legendary baseball manager Bobby Valentine?\\n\\nGARTEN: I did. How did you know that?\\n\\nROCCA: Because I know them both and they...\\n\\nGARTEN: Do you really?\\n\\nROCCA: ...Worship you.\\n\\nGARTEN: Oh, I adore both of them.\\n\\nSAGAL: What high school was this?\\n\\nGARTEN: Rippowam High School in Stamford, Conn.\\n\\nSAGAL: Wow.\\n\\nGARTEN: Yeah.\\n\\nSALIE: How extraordinary that a 16-year-old girl chose someone named Jeffrey Garten over someone named Bobby Valentine.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nSALIE: It could have gone a different way.\\n\\nGARTEN: Bobby Valentine didn't choose me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGARTEN: He was a hero in high school - total hero. When he called me up, I was like, oh, my God. I was like a high school girl with heart palpitations. And I was like - I think I was 65 when he called me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, Ina Garten, we are delighted to talk to you. We've invited you here to play...\\n\\nKURTIS: They're snazzy but a bit pinchy (ph) in the toe box.\\n\\nSAGAL: You are, of course, the Barefoot Contessa, so naturally, we decided to ask you about shoes. Answer 2 out of 3 questions about footwear, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Ina Garten playing for?\\n\\nKURTIS: Carol Anthony of New Orleans, La.\\n\\nSAGAL: All right, you ready to play, Ina?\\n\\nGARTEN: I'm ready.\\n\\nSAGAL: Here's your first question. There are, of course, a lot of specialty shoes. Which of these might you really be able to slip onto your own feet? A, ski-walkers, shoes that sprout skis when you want to get down a snowy hill quickly, B, phone-holder shoes, which can hold your smartphone in the toes so you can just look at your feet and enjoy some YouTube or C, no-place-like-home shoes, you click your heels together three times and a GPS unit guides you home.\\n\\nGARTEN: One of those is true?\\n\\nSAGAL: It's true, one of them is.\\n\\nGARTEN: What was the first one?\\n\\nSAGAL: Ski-walkers, shoes that sprout skis when you want to get down a snowy hill quickly.\\n\\nGARTEN: (Laughter) How about three?\\n\\nSAGAL: You're going to go for three? Is that your choice?\\n\\nGARTEN: I have no idea (laughter).\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, three is the no-place-like-home shoes. You click your heels together and it lights up and shows you how to go home.\\n\\nGARTEN: No.\\n\\nSAGAL: No? You have to choose one, I'm afraid.\\n\\nGARTEN: A phone-holder shoe?\\n\\nSAGAL: Phone-holder shoes. That's the middle choice. You just put your phone on it, you can walk round, look down at your shoe. There's your phone.\\n\\nGARTEN: (Laughter) They're all so improbable, I'm going to choose that one.\\n\\nSAGAL: You're going to choose that one. No, it was actually the no-place-like-home shoes.\\n\\nGARTEN: I was right the first time.\\n\\nGARLIN: Oh.\\n\\nROCCA: Oh, it was the third one?\\n\\nSAGAL: It was, yes.\\n\\nROCCA: Damn.\\n\\nSALIE: Really?\\n\\nSAGAL: These are shoes. They're not commercially available yet. But, yes, the idea is you click three times and it lights up LEDs and it points you the way home.\\n\\nSALIE: Are they red, sparkly shoes?\\n\\nSAGAL: I hope so. All right, next question. You still have two more chances. Shoes can get you in trouble as when which of these incidents happened? A, a fleeing drug dealer was caught by police in a nighttime foot chase 'cause he was wearing those light-up shoes that light up...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: B, 13 models ended up in a basement where the combined stress of their high heels punched through the runway floor or C, a woman's slingback mules got her thrown out of church because of salacious revealing of the toes.\\n\\nGARTEN: The drug dealer.\\n\\nSAGAL: You're right. It's the drug dealer.\\n\\nKURTIS: Yes.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: It happened in the early '90s when those shoes were popular.\\n\\nKURTIS: Good job.\\n\\nSAGAL: All right, last question. If you get this, you win it all. Here we go. One day in 2014, basketball player Manu Ginobili's Nike sneakers did something nobody had ever seen before. What? A, they adhered to the ball, resulting in a scrum of people trying to pull the ball off Ginobili's foot, B, they exploded or C, they shot lasers every time Ginobili scored.\\n\\nGARTEN: I think lasers.\\n\\nSAGAL: You think lasers, that he had shoes that shot lasers?\\n\\nGARTEN: No?\\n\\nSALIE: What year was this?\\n\\nSAGAL: This was just 2014.\\n\\nGARTEN: They exploded?\\n\\nSAGAL: They explode - you're going to choose that one?\\n\\nGARTEN: Yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: That's what happened.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nGARTEN: They just exploded?\\n\\nSAGAL: They just spontaneously burst into...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nGARLIN: They did.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Pieces, yeah.\\n\\nGARLIN: They were Nike Airs...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nGARLIN: ...And they exploded air. It's true.\\n\\nGARTEN: Like telephones, they're not allowed on airplanes now, right?\\n\\nSAGAL: That's right.\\n\\nROCCA: Right, right.\\n\\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Ina Garten do on our quiz?\\n\\nKURTIS: Well, here, if you get 2 out of 3, you're a winner. And she did just that. Congratulations, Ina.\\n\\nSAGAL: Congratulations.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Ina Garten is the Barefoot Contessa. Her latest cookbook is Cooking For Jeffrey. Ina Garten, thank you so much for joining us.\\n\\nGARTEN: So much fun.\\n\\nSAGAL: Thank you, Ina. Take care.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Ethiopia Bans All Foreign Adoptions\\n\\nThe move was sparked by the death of an Ethiopian girl at the hands of her adoptive parents in Seattle. Critics say the new policy may mean more Ethiopian children living in the streets.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nNow, let's follow up on the end of adoptions from Ethiopia. Many Americans adopted children from that country not so long ago. One of them is in my extended family. But after an Ethiopian girl endured abuse at the hands of her adoptive American parents and later died, the country banned all foreigners from adopting. Critics say this new policy could mean more children on the streets, although in Ethiopia, it's a matter of national pride. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports.\\n\\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: I meet Nikki and Brad Huelsman at a hotel in Addis Ababa.\\n\\nNIKKI HUELSMAN: What're you doing? What're you doing?\\n\\nPERALTA: After five years of background checks, paperwork and waiting, they flew from Ohio to finally finish adopting Germa.\\n\\nHUELSMAN: He wins people over with the beautiful eyes and little cheeks that I just want to kiss, right?\\n\\nPERALTA: And now, they have him in their arms, a beautiful 3-year-old boy. But even with all that joy, Nikki Huelsman knows they will be one of the last American families to be able to adopt an Ethiopian child.\\n\\nHUELSMAN: When you pack - start to pack those bags, you're so vulnerable and you're so open to being just devastated if it doesn't happen. It's losing - it would be a loss of a child.\\n\\nPERALTA: In January, Ethiopia's Parliament banned foreign adoptions, saying they were concerned about the safety of their children. In 2011, for example, an adopted Ethiopian child in Seattle died after she was left outside in the cold. The Parliament also said they were worried, that Ethiopian children could suffer identity crises and psychological problems. The Huelsman's older daughter was also adopted from Ethiopia, and they favor stringent vetting. They also tried to teach their daughter about Ethiopian culture.\\n\\nHUELSMAN: I want to believe that Ethiopia finds a way to support their kids and keep their kids in country but also becomes open to the fact that a family is a family, whether they're in the U.S. or they're in Dubai or they're in Nicaragua. They're - anywhere, a family is a family.\\n\\nPERALTA: None of the private orphanages opposed to the new rules would talk to me on the record. One Catholic nun, who did not want to be named because she feared retaliation from the government, says she just hopes these children don't end up on the streets. I do visit one state-run orphanage just outside the capital. Welay Seha, the director, shows me around.\\n\\nWELAY SEHA: This one is a library.\\n\\nPERALTA: It's a sprawling compound nestled between towering pine trees. It's old but tidy. About 195 girls, aged 7 to 18, live here. Welay says they can take nearly 200 more. So they have the capacity and the money to take care of their children.\\n\\nSEHA: Yeah, we have the capacity because this institution is under the government. There is no shortage of budget here.\\n\\n(Speaking Amharic).\\n\\nPERALTA: Welay walks me to a small building where the special needs children live. Their caretakers are in an office, and all of the children are just sitting there, watching television.\\n\\nSEHA: (Speaking Amharic).\\n\\nPERALTA: Ethiopia does not have a strong culture of adoption, so these kids will spend their whole lives here. The ones without special needs will stay until they're 18. I ask Welay if he's sure that these children are better off here than in a family home in the United States.\\n\\nSEHA: We are sure enough because our country is growing.\\n\\nPERALTA: It's growing.\\n\\nSEHA: Yeah.\\n\\nPERALTA: This change comes at a particularly nationalist time in Ethiopia. The country is having political problems, but it is also resurgent. There is an economic boom, and the country has begun asserting itself in geopolitical issues.\\n\\nAbebayehu Fikadu, an administrator at another orphanage, says this policy has a lot to do with Ethiopian pride. Ethiopian children, he says, should be brought up here so they can help the country move forward.\\n\\nABEBAYEHU FIKADU: Even if we are poor, it's better to be with our society, with country. Feeling nationality is not replaced money, you know.\\n\\nPERALTA: The Huelsmans the did make it to the U.S. Big sister is a little jealous, but Germa has learned to love the dogs and has even adjusted to the cold. Mom, Nikki, couldn't be happier.\\n\\nHUELSMAN: Sometimes I look at him, even now, and think, I can't believe we're home. I can't believe this is all - he's here.\\n\\nPERALTA: But it's a shame, they say, that some families will be denied this joy.

{"original": "SPLC On Suing Trump Over Asylum-Seeker Policy\\n\\nNPR's Scott Simon asks the Southern Poverty Law Center's Melissa Crow about challenging a policy requiring asylum-seekers at the Southern border to remain in Mexico while their cases are considered.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nThe Trump administration announced a controversial policy in December for migrants seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border. They would be returned to and remain in Mexico while their asylum cases are considered. The policy is in effect at a major border crossing in San Diego.\\n\\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups are suing the administration, calling the policy - known as the Migration Protection Protocols - quote, war on asylum-seekers and our system of laws. Melissa Crow is with the Southern Poverty Law Center. Thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nMELISSA CROW: Thanks for having me, Scott.\\n\\nSIMON: You contend this policy violates both U.S. and international law. How so?\\n\\nCROW: So first of all, Scott, the government is basing this policy on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that was never intended to apply to the group of asylum-seekers who present themselves at ports of entry along the southern border. We allege that this new policy violates both U.S. and international legal principles that provide that individuals must not be returned to countries where they risk persecution or torture.\\n\\nSIMON: Miss Crow, you and other groups represent 11 asylum-seekers who've already been returned to Mexico. And you believe that Mexico is a country in which they're at risk?\\n\\nCROW: Yes. Even the U.S. State Department has indicated in its Country Reports On Human Rights that there is deep-seated animus in Mexico toward migrants. Other of the plaintiffs have fled gang violence in their countries of origin. And gangs don't observe state boundaries. And these people are terrified that they're going to be killed.\\n\\nSIMON: President Trump and others in the administration say that there are large numbers of people who use these - asylum law - to enter the U.S. and then just disappear. Do you agree?\\n\\nCROW: We strongly disagree. And we think his figures are inaccurate. I would urge him to spend some time down on the border and hear some of the harrowing stories about the situation that these individuals have fled. I would also note that they are trying to enter the country legally, have entered the country legally because they were inspected and processed at ports of entry. And he's been saying for a long time that that's what people should do. So it's kind of like a slap in the face when they try to do that and they get sent back.\\n\\nSIMON: The Department of Homeland Security, though, says that because they can't detain families for more than a few weeks, that's not enough time for the asylum claim to be processed. So they have to come up with something else.\\n\\nCROW: I don't actually see a need to detain people at all. There are lots of alternatives to detention that have been shown to work. In many cases, people are released on ankle monitors so that the government can keep track of where they are. But once again, I don't think that the government's figures on appearance rates at hearings are accurate.\\n\\nSIMON: Mexico has expanded some of the rights of asylum-seekers, non-Mexican asylum-seekers - haven't they? - in recent weeks. Humanitarian visas, work permits, access to legal services, does any of that help?\\n\\nCROW: I know that they have started giving humanitarian visas to individuals who are returned. They are supposed to provide for work authorization. But I understand that a number of our plaintiffs have had trouble finding jobs and also trouble proving that they are entitled to work in Mexico. I think that goes back to the animus against migrants that I spoke of before.\\n\\nSIMON: Do you and other groups have an idea of how many people we might potentially be talking about who were asylum-seekers in Mexico?\\n\\nCROW: We don't have an exact number. The government has said that they're going to expand this policy to Texas in the not-too-distant future. And my understanding is that as of Thursday, eight families were returned- eight families comprised of 13 adults and 13 children. And that was just one day.\\n\\nSIMON: Melissa Crow of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nCROW: Thank you, Scott.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Donald Trump's Messy Ideas For Handling The National Debt, Explained\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe U.S. has $19 trillion in debt, and Donald Trump is upset about it.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, he said he would get rid of all of it in eight years. He walked that back, but his positions on how to handle that debt are still making headlines. Just a few days ago, it seemed like Trump wanted to renegotiate America's debt with the nation's creditors — a potentially disastrous policy. Then it seemed like he was offering a subtler solution. Then he said the U.S. government could print money to stave off default.\\n\\nNothing — not even policy positions — sit still for long in the 2016 election. This same weekend, Trump clarified his positions on two other major economic policy areas. If you haven't been keeping up, here's a quick recap of Trump's changing statements:\\n\\nWhat did Trump initially say about debt?\\n\\nOn CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday, Andrew Ross Sorkin initially brought up the idea of renegotiating debt repayment, in the context of Trump's past business dealings. Here's a video and transcript, emphasis added.\\n\\nARS: Do you believe that we in terms of the United States need to pay 100 cents on the dollar? Or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt? DT: I think, look. I've borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I've done very well with debt. Now of course I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all of that. And you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And if the economy was good it was good so therefore you can't lose. It's like you make a deal before you go into a poker game. And your odds are much better.\\n\\nThat bolded bit, about making a deal on debt, caused mass freakout in the financial press, and for good reason. Suggesting that U.S. creditors accept haircuts on U.S. debt (that is, accept lower payouts than they agreed to) would be an unheard-of, potentially disastrous policy proposition.\\n\\nBut then his meaning got muddier. Anchor Becky Quick asked him twice if he really meant he wanted to renegotiate debt. On his second answer, he seemed to change positions:\\n\\nBQ: You're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued. DT: No, I don't want to renegotiate the bonds, but I think you can do discounting. I think depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things at discounts. I'm not even suggesting that we don't borrow money at very low rates long term so we don't have to worry about when they come due.\\n\\nSo what exactly was he saying?\\n\\nGreat question.\\n\\nIn that first answer, he seemed to say he would want creditors to accept lower payments.\\n\\nAnd that's not just a big deal; that's a gargantuan deal. The prospect of investors in U.S. debt accepting less on the dollar than they are owed could tank the economy (more on that later).\\n\\nBut even then, his later answer made muddier exactly what he meant. Trump went on to say he didn't want to renegotiate but rather wanted to discount or refinance U.S. Treasurys. That could very well mean he still wanted to offer creditors lower rates, said one economist. But there's another reading.\\n\\nHe keeps mentioning interest rates, so being charitable, he could mean that the United States should buy back debt when its price falls, said Michael Strain, economics fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\nWhat's the fuss?\\n\\nIf the government asked investors to accept less on the dollar than they are owed, it would be phenomenally bad for the economy.\\n\\nThere are no merits to it, Strain said. He added, The extent to which U.S. Treasurys are kind of the foundation on which the global financial system is built is really hard to overstate.\\n\\nFor one thing, it would send interest rates on Treasurys soaring and destroy the U.S. Treasury's risk-free status. That's what Strain means by foundation; right now, everyone knows and trusts that U.S. debt is a safe investment. Treasurys are used in all sorts of financial transactions worldwide. They're in many people's retirement accounts as a low-risk asset. Rattling faith in that Treasury would introduce massive amounts of uncertainty into the economy.\\n\\nPlus, it would cause interest rates on U.S. debt to soar. That would mean higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government — making the very fiscal situation Trump is worried about even worse.\\n\\nAll of this could dry up credit markets, as the uncertainty could make banks far less likely to lend money. Cut back on borrowing and lending, and you deliver a huge blow to the economy.\\n\\nIt's not even clear how this idea would work, says one financial expert — creditors wouldn't have much of an incentive to take the deal, with the U.S. currently on firm financial footing.\\n\\nTypically the goal of a sovereign default is for a country to reset its borrowings base in order to make sure it can be fiscally sustainable going forward, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney. And creditors or lenders have an interest in participating in that process, because they believe they can get the best return from negotiation.\\n\\nWhat is Trump saying now?\\n\\nHe says that all along, he just wanted the U.S. government to buy back debt at lower prices.\\n\\nIf there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, interest rates up and the bonds down, and you can buy debt. That's what I'm talking about, he said, as reported by Politico.\\n\\nSo if that's what Trump wants, how would this work? It's a complicated proposition, but Dean Baker at the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research explains in a blog post:\\n\\nIf interest rates rise, the situation Trump described, the market value of long-term debt falls. For example, a 30-year bond issued in 2015 at an interest rate of less than 3.0 percent, might sell for less than 70 percent of its nominal value if the long-term interest rate crosses 6 or 7 percent, which it certainly could. The Treasury could buy up long-term debt in the market at its current market value, and replace it with new debt that paid a higher interest rate. This won't change the interest payments owed by the government, but it would reduce the nominal value of the debt outstanding.\\n\\nLong story short: It would lower the debt level but raise the interest rate the U.S. is paying altogether, essentially trading one problem for the other. Why would we do that? In Baker's telling, this is a solution only insofar as someone cares a lot about nominal debt levels and debt-to-GDP ratios (and it's not clear that Trump does).\\n\\nAs LeBas told NPR, unless somehow the U.S. were running a surplus, buying back debt at a discount wouldn't do much good.\\n\\nIf the U.S. were running a deficit and interest rates rose, the government could buy back its debt at discount prices, he said. But then it would have to issue more debt at a higher interest rate to fund the buyback, which would be a wash.\\n\\nTrump has also created new shock waves by saying — in this case quite clearly — that the U.S. can't default, because it prints money. That's true, but that doesn't mean it's good policy (as in, it could easily cause massive inflation).\\n\\nWhat exactly has this whole exercise taught us?\\n\\nAside from the economics lesson, it provided a picture of one of the Trump campaign's biggest recent weaknesses. His clarifications on the U.S. debt also came in the midst of a weekend in which Trump clarified his position on two other major economic issues: Trump said he thought the minimum wage should be raised on a state-by-state level. In November, he had said in a debate that he thought wages were too high.\\n\\nAnd in the same weekend that he wrestled with how to tackle the debt, he explained, then re-explained, his tax plan (which the Tax Policy Center said would raise deficits by $9.5 trillion over 10 years): He at first in an interview with NBC seemed to say he would raise taxes on the wealthy.\\n\\nBut then he clarified that he meant that after negotiating with Congress, taxes might end up higher than the low rates he initially proposed, but they would end up lower than they are now.\\n\\nAll of which is to say that it's not clear the Trump campaign has settled positions on a range of economic policy issues. These kinds of clarifications and policy shifts give the Clinton campaign ample ammunition for attacking Trump in two ways: one, for potentially harmful economic policies, and two, for not having firm policy principles.\\n\\nThat's bad for Trump. Any time that a candidate has to spend playing defense — explaining policies or wording choices, for example — is time he or she is not spending playing offense."}

Such an action may be brought in any judicial district in the State in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or in the judicial district in which the plaintiff would have worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office. For purposes of sections 1404 and 1406 of title 28 of the United States Code, the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office shall in all cases be considered a district in which the action might have been brought.\\n\\n(g) If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice). Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. No order of the court shall require the admission or reinstatement of an individual as a member of a union or the hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was refused admission, suspended, or expelled or was refused employment or advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex or national origin or in violation of section 704(a).\\n\\n(h) The provisions of the Act entitled An Act to amend the Judicial Code and to define and limit the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity, and for other purposes, approved March 23, 1932 (29 U.S.C. 101-115), shall not apply with respect to civil actions brought under this section.\\n\\n(i) In any case in which an employer, employment agency, or labor organization fails to comply with an order of a court issued in a civil action brought under subsection (e), the Commission may commence proceedings to compel compliance with such order.\\n\\n(j) Any civil action brought under subsection (e) and any proceedings brought under subsection (i) shall be subject to appeal as provided in sections 1291 and 1292, title 28, United States Code.\\n\\n(k) In any action or proceeding under this title the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs , and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\\n\\nSEC. 707.\\n\\n(a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights secured by this title, and that the pattern or practice is of such a nature and is intended to deny the full exercise of the rights herein described, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States by filing with it a complaint (1) signed by him (or in his absence the Acting Attorney General), (2) setting forth facts pertaining to such pattern or practice, and (3) requesting such relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order or other order against the person or persons responsible for such pattern or practice, as he deems necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights herein described.\\n\\n(b) The district courts of the United States shall have and shall exercise jurisdiction of proceedings instituted pursuant to this section, and in any such proceeding the Attorney General may file with the clerk of such court a request that a court of three judges be convened to hear and determine the case. Such request by the Attorney General shall be accompanied by a certificate that, in his opinion, the case is of general public importance. A copy of the certificate and request for a three-judge court shall be immediately furnished by such clerk to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the presiding circuit judge of the circuit) in which the case is pending. Upon receipt of such request it shall be the duty of the chief judge of the circuit or the presiding circuit judge, as the case may be, to designate immediately three judges in such circuit, of whom at least one shall be a circuit judge and another of whom shall be a district judge of the court in which the proceeding was instituted, to hear and determine such case, and it shall be the duty of the judges so designated to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date, to participate in the hearing and determination thereof, and to cause the case to be in every way expedited. An appeal from the final judgment of such court will lie to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn the event the Attorney General fails to file such a request in any such proceeding, it shall be the duty of the chief judge of the district (or in his absence, the acting chief judge) in which the case is pending immediately to designate a judge in such district to hear and determine the case. In the event that no judge in the district is available to hear and determine the case, the chief judge of the district, or the acting chief judge, as the case may be, shall certify this fact to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the acting chief judge) who shall then designate a district or circuit judge of the circuit to hear and determine the case.\\n\\nIt shall be the duty of the judge designated pursuant to this section to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.\\n\\nEFFECT ON STATE LAWS\\n\\nSEC. 708.\\n\\nNothing in this title shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice under this title.\\n\\nINVESTIGATIONS, INSPECTIONS, RECORDS, STATE AGENCIES\\n\\nSEC. 709.\\n\\n(a) In connection with any investigation of a charge filed under section 706, the Commission or its designated representative shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purposes of examination, and the right to copy any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by this title and is relevant to the charge under investigation.\\n\\n(b) The Commission may cooperate with State and local agencies charged with the administration of State fair employment practices laws and, with the consent of such agencies, may for the purpose of carrying out its functions and duties under this title and within the limitation of funds appropriated specifically for such purpose, utilize the services of such agencies and their employees and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may reimburse such agencies and their employees for services rendered to assist the Commission in carrying out this title. In furtherance of such cooperative efforts, the Commission may enter into written agreements with such State or local agencies and such agreements may include provisions under which the Commission shall refrain from processing a charge in any cases or class of cases specified in such agreements and under which no person may bring a civil action under section 706 in any cases or class of cases so specified, or under which the Commission shall relieve any person or class of persons in such State or locality from requirements imposed under this section. The Commission shall rescind any such agreement whenever it determines that the agreement no longer serves the interest of effective enforcement of this title.\\n\\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), every employer, employment agency, and labor organization subject to this title shall (1) make and keep such records relevant to the determinations of whether unlawful employment practices have been or are being committed, (2) preserve such records for such periods, and (3) make such reports therefrom, as the Commission shall prescribe by regulation or order, after public hearing, as reasonable, necessary, or appropriate for the enforcement of this title or the regulations or orders thereunder. The Commission shall, by regulation, require each employer, labor organization, and joint labor-management committee subject to this title which controls an apprenticeship or other training program to maintain such records as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this title, including, but not limited to, a list of applicants who wish to participate in such program, including the chronological order in which such applications were received, and shall furnish to the Commission, upon request, a detailed description of the manner in which persons are selected to participate in the apprenticeship or other training program. Any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee which believes that the application to it of any regulation or order issued under this section would result in undue hardship may (1) apply to the Commission for an exemption from the application of such regulation or order, or (2) bring a civil action in the United States district court for the district where such records are kept. If the Commission or the court, as the case may be, finds that the application of the regulation or order to the employer, employment agency, or labor organization in question would impose an undue hardship, the Commission or the court, as the case may be, may grant appropriate relief.\\n\\n(d) The provisions of subsection (c) shall not apply to any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee with respect to matters occurring in any State or political subdivision thereof which has a fair employment practice law during any period in which such employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee is subject to such law, except that the Commission may require such notations on records which such employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee keeps or is required to keep as are necessary because of differences in coverage or methods of enforcement between the State or local law and the provisions of this title. Where an employer is required by Executive Order 10925, issued March 6, 1961, or by any other Executive order prescribing fair employment practices for Government contractors and subcontractors, or by rules or regulations issued thereunder, to file reports relating to his employment practices with any Federal agency or committee, and he is substantially in compliance with such requirements, the Commission shall not require him to file additional reports pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\\n\\n(e) It shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the Commission to make public in any manner whatever any information obtained by the Commission pursuant to its authority under this section prior to the institution of any proceeding under this title involving such information. Any officer or employee of the Commission who shall make public in any manner whatever any information in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year.\\n\\nINVESTIGATORY POWERS\\n\\nSEC. 710.\\n\\n(a) For the purposes of any investigation of a charge filed under the authority contained in section 706, the Commission shall have authority to examine witnesses under oath and to require the production of documentary evidence relevant or material to the charge under investigation.\\n\\n(b) If the respondent named in a charge filed under section 706 fails or refuses to comply with a demand of the Commission for permission to examine or to copy evidence in conformity with the provisions of section 709(a), or if any person required to comply with the provisions of section 709 (c) or (d) fails or refuses to do so, or if any person fails or refuses to comply with a demand by the Commission to give testimony under oath, the United States district court for the district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, shall, upon application of the Commission, have jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring him to comply with the provisions of section 709 (c) or (d) or to comply with the demand of the Commission, but the attendance of a witness may not be required outside the State where he is found, resides, or transacts business and the production of evidence may not be required outside the State where such evidence is kept.\\n\\n(c) Within twenty days after the service upon any person charged under section 706 of a demand by the Commission for the production of documentary evidence or for permission to examine or to copy evidence in conformity with the provisions of section 709(a), such person may file in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which he resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon the Commission a petition for an order of such court modifying or setting aside such demand. The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of such petition in the court. Such petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking such relief, and may be based upon any failure of such demand to comply with the provisions of this title or with the limitations generally applicable to compulsory process or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person. No objection which is not raised by such a petition may be urged in the defense to a proceeding initiated by the Commission under subsection (b) for enforcement of such a demand unless such proceeding is commenced by the Commission prior to the expiration of the twenty-day period, or unless the court determines that the defendant could not reasonably have been aware of the availability of such ground of objection.\\n\\n(d) In any proceeding brought by the Commission under subsection (b), except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the defendant may petition the court for an order modifying or setting aside the demand of the Commission.\\n\\nSEC. 711.\\n\\n(a) Every employer, employment agency, and labor organization, as the case may be, shall post and keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices to employees, applicants for employment, and members are customarily posted a notice to be prepared or approved by the Commission setting forth excerpts from or, summaries of, the pertinent provisions of this title and information pertinent to the filing of a complaint.\\n\\n(b) A willful violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $100 for each separate offense.\\n\\nVETERANS' PREFERENCE\\n\\nSEC. 712.\\n\\nNothing contained in this title shall be construed to repeal or modify any Federal, State, territorial, or local law creating special rights or preference for veterans.\\n\\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\\n\\nSEC. 713.\\n\\n(a) The Commission shall have authority from time to time to issue, amend, or rescind suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this title. Regulations issued under this section shall be in conformity with the standards and limitations of the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n\\n(b) In any action or proceeding based on any alleged unlawful employment practice, no person shall be subject to any liability or punishment for or on account of (1) the commission by such person of an unlawful employment practice if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good faith, in conformity with, and in reliance on any written interpretation or opinion of the Commission, or (2) the failure of such person to publish and file any information required by any provision of this title if he pleads and proves that he failed to publish and file such information in good faith, in conformity with the instructions of the Commission issued under this title regarding the filing of such information. Such a defense, if established, shall be a bar to the action or proceeding, notwithstanding that (A) after such act or omission, such interpretation or opinion is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority to be invalid or of no legal effect, or (B) after publishing or filing the description and annual reports, such publication or filing is determined by judicial authority not to be in conformity with the requirements of this title.\\n\\nFORCIBLY RESISTING THE COMMISSION OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES\\n\\nSEC. 714.\\n\\nThe provisions of section 111, title 18, United States Code, shall apply to officers, agents, and employees of the Commission in the performance of their official duties.\\n\\nSPECIAL STUDY BY SECRETARY OF LABOR\\n\\nSEC. 715.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Labor shall make a full and complete study of the factors which might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the consequences of such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected. The Secretary of Labor shall make a report to the Congress not later than June 30, 1965, containing the results of such study and shall include in such report such recommendations for legislation to prevent arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age as he determines advisable.\\n\\nEFFECTIVE DATE\\n\\nSEC. 716.\\n\\n(a) This title shall become effective one year after the date of its enactment.\\n\\n(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), sections of this title other than sections 703, 704, 706, and 707 shall become effective immediately.\\n\\n(c) The President shall, as soon as feasible after the enactment of this title, convene one or more conferences for the purpose of enabling the leaders of groups whose members will be affected by this title to become familiar with the rights afforded and obligations imposed by its provisions, and for the purpose of making plans which will result in the fair and effective administration of this title when all of its provisions become effective. The President shall invite the participation in such conference or conferences of (1) the members of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, (2) the members of the Commission on Civil Rights, (3) representatives of State and local agencies engaged in furthering equal employment opportunity, (4) representatives of private agencies engaged in furthering equal employment opportunity, and (5) representatives of employers, labor organizations, and employment agencies who will be subject to this title.\\n\\nTitle VIII\\n\\nREGISTRATION AND VOTING STATISTICS\\n\\nSEC. 801.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce shall promptly conduct a survey to compile registration and voting statistics in such geographic areas as may be recommended by the Commission on Civil Rights.

The Director is further authorized to procure services as authorized by section 15 of the Act of August 2, 1946 (60 Stat. 810; 5 U.S.C. 55(a)), but at rates for individuals not in excess of $75 per diem.\\n\\n(b) Section 106(a) of the Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956, as amended (5 U.S.C. 2205(a)), is further amended by adding the following clause thereto:\\n\\n(52) Director, Community Relations Service.\\n\\nSEC. 1002.\\n\\nIt shall be the function of the Service to provide assistance to communities and persons therein in resolving disputes, disagreements, or difficulties relating to discriminatory practices based on race, color, or national origin which impair the rights of persons in such communities under the Constitution or laws of the United States or which affect or may affect interstate commerce. The Service may offer its services in cases of such disputes, disagreements, or difficulties whenever, in its judgment, peaceful relations among the citizens of the community involved are threatened thereby, and it may offer its services either upon its own motion or upon the request of an appropriate State or local official or other interested person.\\n\\nSEC. 1003.\\n\\n(a) The Service shall, whenever possible, in performing its functions, seek and utilize the cooperation of appropriate State or local, public, or private agencies.\\n\\n(b) The activities of all officers and employees of the Service in providing conciliation assistance shall be conducted in confidence and without publicity, and the Service shall hold confidential any information acquired in the regular performance of its duties upon the understanding that it would be so held.

{"original": "Idealism Vs. Pragmatism: How Style Divides The Democratic Candidates\\n\\nThere are policy differences between the two leading Democratic presidential candidates, but those differences are small compared to the gap in style and tone.\\n\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\n\\nOn the Democratic side of the presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have similar priorities, but they're going about them very differently. Our reporters Asma Khalid and Tamara Keith have been spending time on the Democratic campaign trail in Iowa, and they bring back this look at the battle between idealism and pragmatism.\\n\\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: This is Asma, and I've been out on the trail with Bernie Sanders. Anytime you hear Sanders speak, he runs through a litany of depressing statistics and then calls for a revolution, as he did on CNN earlier this week.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBERNIE SANDERS: These problems are so serious that we have got to go beyond the establishment politics and establishment economics. In my view, we need a political revolution.\\n\\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This is Tamara, and I've been covering the Clinton campaign. She doesn't tend to dwell on what's wrong with America, but Clinton is clear-eyed about the political reality she would face as president and the likelihood she would have to negotiate with a Republican Congress.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON: I'll tell you, I'm not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world.\\n\\nKEITH: But the difference in approach isn't just about style. It's also about substance.\\n\\nKHALID: Take, for example, the minimum wage. Sanders' position is simple. He wants a national $15 minimum wage.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSANDERS: Wages in America are too damn low. A minimum wage today of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage.\\n\\nKEITH: As with so many things, for Clinton, the answer is more complicated. She says she's taking her lead from Senate Democrats who introduced a $12 minimum-wage bill last year.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCLINTON: They could justify 12. I'm really persuaded by that, and that's where I am. So I want to raise the federal minimum wage to 12, and then I want to encourage more communities, if they can afford to, to go higher.\\n\\nKEITH: Issue after issue, Clinton offers a more pragmatic prescription.\\n\\nKHALID: That doesn't sit well with Sanders' supporters.\\n\\nJENINE CASSON: I think we're kind of past pragmatism in America.\\n\\nKHALID: That's Jenine Casson. I met her at a Sanders town hall.\\n\\nCASSON: People are upset with the way things are, and there's a lot of disillusionment. And I think we're on a path to where we need to upset the system a bit more.\\n\\nKHALID: Casson was earnest, and I asked her why she supports Sanders. She said she just loves all of his policies.\\n\\nCASSON: Taking America back and making it great again I think is what's important to a lot of America, and he speaks to us.\\n\\nKHALID: So I'm not sure if you caught that. Casson just used two Donald Trump catchphrases without the faintest sign of irony. Sanders backers, like Trump fans, say they're frustrated, even angry, and that the status quo needs to change. David Harris got emotional telling me how badly he wants that change.\\n\\nDAVID HARRIS: This is the first time I've heard any candidate say anything that makes me want to participate again. He's the only one out there. God, I hope people - I hope people elect him. He's the last chance.\\n\\nKEITH: At Clinton events, I've never seen quite that kind of emotion. I met Carolyn Sabroske at a recent one.\\n\\nCAROLYN SABROSKE: You don't go leaving charged up. You go considering everything that she had to say.\\n\\nKEITH: She left undecided. Clinton's supporters, though, talk a lot about her experience and temperament. Jill Gaultier went into an event last week unsure who she would support. I caught up with her after it was over.\\n\\nJILL GAULTIER: I believe I'm a Hillary fan now.\\n\\nKEITH: Really.\\n\\nGAULTIER: Yes.\\n\\nKEITH: What was it?\\n\\nGAULTIER: Just the - she's not making promises, but she's going to try, and I'm very encouraged that she has the ability to lead this country to better times.\\n\\nKEITH: Gaultier says Clinton's not handing you the hype, and she appreciates that. Eighteen-year-old Maria Kosovich stood by a rope line, cell phone in hand, waiting for Clinton.\\n\\nMARIA KOSOVICH: I just made Hillary talk to my dad.\\n\\nKEITH: The funny thing about this is Kosovich says her dad supports Sanders. But she's planning to caucus for Clinton.\\n\\nKOSOVICH: When she gives an idea, she also gives her plan and how to enact it. And I think sincerity, above all, is most important - than empty promises.\\n\\nKHALID: Of course, Sanders and his supporters argue his promises are not empty. They think the country is ripe for a political revolution.\\n\\nKEITH: There are passion elections, and there are persuasion elections. Next week, we'll get a clue as to which one this is. I'm Tamara Keith.\\n\\nKHALID: And I'm Asma Khalid, NPR News.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

The marketplaces are the go-to option for people under 65 who don't get health insurance through work or qualify for Medicaid.\\n\\nThis time around, there's a last-minute wrinkle: The Trump administration has halted advertising and outreach for HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange, in the last week of enrollment, when sign-ups typically surge.\\n\\nBut the states that control their own exchanges also control their own promotion and, for now, their destiny.\\n\\nAll told, 11 states and the District of Columbia run their own marketplaces. Under the ACA, the marketplaces were supposed to become self-sustaining businesses within a few years, supported by fees insurers pay to offer plans on the sites.\\n\\nBut the election of Donald Trump as president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress mean that proposition, like the rest of the health law, is now in doubt.\\n\\nHere's what five exchange chiefs are looking at now and for the future.\\n\\nCalifornia Has Ingredients To 'Make The Individual Market Work'\\n\\nPeter Lee, executive director, Covered California\\n\\nMore than 5 million Californians — about a quarter of all Americans now covered under Obamacare — gained insurance either through Medicaid expansion or on the state's exchange, called Covered California.\\n\\nWith the Affordable Care Act now on the political chopping block, California has a lot to lose.\\n\\nBut Covered California's executive director, Peter Lee, says he is planning for a different scenario. He hopes to position California as a leader in a new model for health coverage nationwide.\\n\\nI do think that we have a number of the ingredients of what can make the individual market work, Lee says. And we want to take those lessons to members of Congress and to policy leaders.\\n\\nIn particular, Lee believes California's market-based approach is one that would be in sync, philosophically, with many of the things I hear from Republican and Democratic members of Congress and the Trump administration.\\n\\nWe have about 1.4 million Californians shopping in our marketplace picking private plans with the leg up of federal tax credits that make health care affordable to 90 percent of them, Lee says.\\n\\nCalifornia's marketplace has had its share of problems. A reliance on inaccurate provider directories left some consumers exposed to higher-than-expected medical bills. Consumers also complained about narrow networks that left them unable to choose the doctors they wanted.\\n\\nBut overall, the state is considered an ACA success story, thanks in part to innovative approaches, including state discretion to choose which insurers could operate in its market and then to negotiate premiums and benefits with those insurers.\\n\\nIt's a consumer-centric market solution, Lee says. Whether you're a Republican or Democrat or independent, it's a market-based solution that has a lesson for the country.\\n\\nStill, Lee's hopefulness is tempered by the knowledge that California faces a loss of $20 billion in federal funds if the promised Obamacare repeal happens without a replacement that preserves Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies.\\n\\nUnder that scenario, Lee says, people would have their health insurance pulled out from under them in droves.\\n\\nThe whole issue of repeal without replace is cataclysmic not just for California or Californians but for any of the 20 million Americans that have coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, he says.\\n\\nEven in the face of a very fuzzy future, Lee says he is focusing on the present, which includes shepherding more than 300,000 Californians newly enrolled in health care into 2017 coverage. He also wants to get the word out on parts of California's plan that can be adopted elsewhere.\\n\\nThere have been some things that have not worked great with the Affordable Care Act; there are some things that have worked pretty darn well, Lee says. Let's make sure the laboratory of the states is a laboratory that's sharing the lessons of success and failure with one another.\\n\\nStephanie O'Neill, freelance reporter based in Ojai, Calif.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of NY State of Health Courtesy of NY State of Health\\n\\nNew York Fears A Return To '$1,000 A Month For An Individual Policy'\\n\\nDonna Frescatore, executive director, NY State of Health\\n\\nThe New York state health exchange is fielding its busiest enrollment period yet, even with the uncertainty about the health law's future.\\n\\nA repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without significant replacement, could cost 2.7 million New Yorkers their health insurance and the state $3.7 billion, according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.\\n\\nWe believe that the stakes here in New York are dramatic — for consumers, for our health care delivery system and for our state budget as well, says Donna Frescatore, executive director of NY State of Health, New York's marketplace.\\n\\nLosing momentum is one of Frescatore's main concerns. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate in New York was cut in half, falling from 10 percent to 5 percent, according to the state's health department.\\n\\nWe talk to moms who are concerned because their children have pre-existing conditions and they're afraid coverage might no longer be available. We talk to self-employed New Yorkers who fear that the premiums could increase to the 2013 levels — over $1,000 a month for an individual policy, Frescatore says.\\n\\nWithout financial support from the federal government, premiums may increase.\\n\\nOptions may revert to health insurance plans as they were in New York before the ACA.\\n\\nNew York had a number of very strong consumer protections in place before the Affordable Care Act, including guaranteed issue, says Frescatore. People could get insurance regardless of whether or not they had a medical condition or illness, as well as other consumer protections. We'll maintain those protections.\\n\\nBut without an individual mandate bringing enough people into the insurance pool and no financial assistance, she adds, the price of plans is just out of reach financially for many consumers.\\n\\nFor now, the New York exchange continues outreach to enroll consumers and reassure them that policies won't be disrupted throughout 2017.\\n\\nAt this point, without knowing more details about repeal or replacement, what we're really focused on is getting people coverage that they deserve, Frescatore says.\\n\\nKaren Shakerdge, WXXI and Side Effects Public Media\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Access Health CT Courtesy of Access Health CT\\n\\nConnecticut To Insurers: 'We're Making Changes In The Positive Direction'\\n\\nJim Wadleigh, CEO, Access Health CT\\n\\n\\n\\nConnecticut was an early adopter of the ACA. After the law was enacted, the state expanded Medicaid ahead of schedule to cover roughly 200,000 more people a year. For this year, more than 100,000 people enrolled in coverage they found on the state-based exchange, with nearly 80 percent getting subsidies.\\n\\nBut while the exchange may have been attractive to many consumers, it was less appealing to insurers. Two of the four original insurance companies in the marketplace are no longer in it. Now, with an uncertain future ahead, Access Health CT CEO Jim Wadleigh says he has one hard goal in mind as he thinks beyond 2017: What can we do to help make the business environment that our carriers are in easier for them to be more successful?\\n\\nInsurers have told Wadleigh that they lose money on customers who miss open enrollment periods and go through special enrollment — the process reserved for people with big life events or job changes that merit new insurance.\\n\\nWhat the carriers are telling us is, these customers are coming in ... finding a reason that they have a life event because they're sick, get services, and then drop out, he says.\\n\\nThat's an expensive pattern. This week, Wadleigh is asking his board to approve a plan to ramp up enforcement.\\n\\nIf we can do a better job enforcing the special enrollment, we think we can reduce the premiums by potentially 6 percent to 10 percent, he says.\\n\\nAnother way to reduce costs? Shrink provider networks. So, let's say you live in Hartford. Do you really need to pay for a plan that covers a doctor's visit in Danbury?\\n\\nCustomers are telling us they would go with a network choice option, or a narrow network, if it was cheaper and/or had a lower deductible, he says.\\n\\nThat chance, he says, could save another few percentage points in premiums.\\n\\nThird, Wadleigh says he is considering changes that would push more of the cost of emergency room visits to consumers, hoping to deter frequent ER fliers.\\n\\nThe question is whether all of this will work. Wadleigh says he thinks it will. He already has had discussions with existing carriers that are curious whether other insurers are looking to get into the marketplace.\\n\\nSo what that is telling me is that the carriers think that we're making changes in the positive direction, he says. And we expect that other carriers would be interested in joining our exchange with that.\\n\\nWhether they do — and whether the exchange will even be around for them to join — is still very much unclear.\\n\\nJeff Cohen, WNPR\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Massachusetts Health Connector Courtesy of the Massachusetts Health Connector\\n\\nMassachusetts Chief Says, 'Every Day Is a Good Day of Coverage'\\n\\nLouis Gutierrez, executive director, Massachusetts Health Connector\\n\\nA near record number of Massachusetts residents are signing up for coverage through the state's online insurance market, the Health Connector. Enrollment is running 32 percent ahead of last year as the Jan. 31 deadline approaches. Around 47,000 people who didn't have insurance through the exchange last year have purchased insurance for 2017.\\n\\nSo many members, physicians and others in the health care world were stunned when Louis Gutierrez, who runs the exchange, said he couldn't guarantee coverage through the end of 2017 for the nearly 240,000 enrollees so far.\\n\\nI don't want to be in the business of speculating or making commitments about things I can't personally control, Gutierrez says. I don't think any of us really know what's going to happen with the repeal of the ACA.\\n\\nGutierrez says he is not predicting precipitous changes but adds that he can't speak to the future. Every day is a good day of coverage.\\n\\nHealth insurers, which are threatening to pull out of exchanges in some states, aren't the main concern in Massachusetts. Gutierrez says he is hearing very little from the state's mature and stable market. Most plans that sell insurance through the Health Connector are nonprofits based in the state. And they may have less reason to worry that healthy members will flee, leaving insurers to cover the high costs of ill members. Massachusetts residents would still be required to buy insurance, by state law, even if the ACA mandate is repealed.\\n\\nBut if federal funds shrink or disappear, it's likely coverage would become very expensive for the 178,000 men and women who expect to receive subsidies or tax credits for insurance purchased through the exchange.\\n\\nWe're interested in maintaining broad and affordable access to coverage, Gutierrez said, but that will depend on the shape of any subsidies that change or happen in the new scheme.\\n\\nMany Massachusetts residents are wondering whether the state could revert to the law passed in 2006, which became a model for Obamacare. The individual mandate is still on the books, but the employer mandate and other elements were replaced with provisions in the federal law.\\n\\nMartha Bebinger, WBUR\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Connect for Health Colorado Courtesy of Connect for Health Colorado\\n\\nColorado Looks Toward 'Working Together As Western States'\\n\\nKevin Patterson, CEO, Connect for Health Colorado\\n\\n\\n\\nThe view from Kevin Patterson, the CEO of Connect for Health Colorado, might be summarized as sunny with storm clouds on the horizon. I think we're feeling like things are going really well, he says.\\n\\nPatterson says enrollment numbers for 2017 are running 15 percent ahead of last year. But two things are clouding the future. First, the new Trump administration and congressional Republicans are vowing to undo Obamacare.\\n\\nSecond, the Colorado exchange is under fire from state lawmakers. As soon as the legislative session got underway in January, Republicans unveiled a bill to repeal the exchange altogether. They are expected to zero in on a recent federal audit that found the exchange improperly spent millions in federal funds and called for refunds.\\n\\nPatterson says the exchange has made many changes and disagrees with the recommendation to refund the money.\\n\\nThe exchange is expected to survive the legislative turmoil, but it still faces the possibility of federal subsidies disappearing under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nBut Patterson believes the exchange could carry on. I do think there are things that we've learned that could be applied in a new era or whatever post-ACA is, he says.\\n\\nStill, he worries an Obamacare repeal without a timely, adequate replacement could cause some insurers to pull out of the exchange or charge higher rates. Already consumers saw premiums go up and choice go down this year. And this is pressing — insurers have to file rate requests in Colorado in May. So the clock is ticking, Patterson says. Somebody has to give us a little more guidance I think to the industry around what the new world is going to look like. And I think the sooner we do that the better it is for every consumer.\\n\\nBut, beyond 2017, he says, the exchange could look to expand its other lines of business beyond the individual marketplace. That could include helping small employers and public sector employers not in the marketplace figure out insurance packages and benefits. I think that's somewhere where we can show some more value, he says.\\n\\nColorado's exchange is also flirting with the possibility of working with neighboring states, particularly those in the Mountain time zone. We're kind of used to working together as Western states on problems that are really unique to us, Patterson says. That's where I would start.\\n\\nJohn Daley, Colorado Public Radio\\n\\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local member stations and Kaiser Health News."}
{"original": "Response To Capitol Riot Could Hurt Minorities, Civil Libertarians Say\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nCivil liberties advocates are warning that the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol could lead to new police and surveillance powers. If history is a guide, they say, those tools could be used against Blacks and other people of color in the justice system, not the white rioters who stormed Congress.\\n\\nAlbert Fox Cahn watched in horror last week as rioters beat and shoved their way into the U.S. Capitol. The civil rights lawyer said the images made him angry.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, in that moment, I myself felt that same anger, that I want to catch these guys after seeing what they did to our Capitol, Cahn said. And that anger, that frustration, that desire for justice, can lead us to very dangerous places.\\n\\nCahn is executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a group that fights what he calls invasive surveillance technologies. Those include tools like facial recognition and the use of cellphone location data.\\n\\nCahn says he worries that all of those things are on the table as lawmakers confront how close they came to danger last week — and that such things are being embraced even by members of Congress who have been open to the idea of reducing police power.\\n\\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who previously supported such a move, has now proposed expanding the federal no-fly list to add Capitol rioters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese insurrectionists, many of whom are at large, should not be able to hop on a flight, Schumer said at a news conference this week.\\n\\nThe head of the FBI's Washington Field Office, Steven D'Antuono, would not rule that out at a separate news conference in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nAs for the no-fly list, we look at all tools and all techniques that we can possibly use, within the FBI, and that's something we are actively looking at, he said.\\n\\nCritics say the no-fly list is bloated and often ineffective since it has information that can be wrong or out of date. The list has provoked lawsuits from Muslims who allege they were put on the list because of racial profiling.\\n\\nThe deadly assault on the Capitol is also reviving the idea of creating a new federal crime of domestic terrorism. That idea has won support from former national security prosecutors and a trade group for FBI agents. President-elect Joe Biden has expressed openness to a new domestic terror law too.\\n\\nBut Gregory Nojeim, who directs the Freedom, Security, and Technology Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, says not so fast.\\n\\nThe reason there's not such a crime is that there's concern, and it's legitimate, that such a statute could be used to squelch free expression, Nojeim said.\\n\\nNojeim pointed out that the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, is already considering the charge of sedition against some culprits. That carries the potential for a 20-year prison sentence.\\n\\nIt would be a shame if the response to poor policing was to give the police more authority that would infringe on civil liberties, Nojeim said.\\n\\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., agreed.\\n\\nThis week, Omar tweeted: We cannot simply expand the tools that have oppressed Black and Brown people. The answer is not a broader security structure, or a deeper police state. We have to stay rooted in a love of justice and of human rights and of civil liberties as we seek accountability.\\n\\nFBI officials wouldn't confirm whether they are using facial-recognition tools to help identify members of the mob that stormed the Capitol. But civil rights lawyers have a hunch they are.\\n\\nFaulty facial-recognition tools have led to wrongful arrests of Black men and an ongoing lawsuit in New Jersey.\\n\\nUntil those racial disparities are fixed, said Catherine Crump, director of the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Law, this is not a technology that should be deployed on a widespread basis."}

Despite polls showing an increasingly tight race in California between her and Bernie Sanders, Clinton didn't mention the Vermont senator once.)\\n\\nIt came a bit more than a month after Trump delivered a major foreign policy address of his own, where he blamed the Obama administration's approach to the world as reckless, rudderless and aimless.\\n\\nWhile decisions Clinton helped shape as secretary of state, such as the intervention in Libya, have left her open to criticism, her argument at times boiled down to the fact that she's experienced in the field. Clinton walked through a brief overview of her tenure as secretary of state, senator and first lady, before lampooning what she framed as Trump's naiveté.\\n\\nThere's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal, Clinton said.

{"original": "FACT CHECK: Is President Trump Correct That Coal Mines Are Opening?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Speicher/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review via AP Dan Speicher/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review via AP\\n\\nAs he announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump said he was putting American jobs ahead of the needs and desires of other countries.\\n\\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, he said Thursday.\\n\\nTrump said the agreement was very unfair for the U.S., especially the U.S. coal industry. And he alluded to some recent good news for the battered industry: the development of new mines.\\n\\nThe Claim\\n\\nThe mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try.\\n\\nShort Answer\\n\\nYes, mines are beginning to open up, including a new one in Pennsylvania. But that doesn't reverse the overall decline of the coal mining industry from its glory days.\\n\\nLong Answer\\n\\nThe coal mines that are opening up produce a special kind of coal used in steelmaking and are opening largely because of events unrelated to federal policy, experts say. The market for the kind of coal used in electricity — the biggest use for coal — remains down relative to where it was several years ago.\\n\\nIn other words, the industry has rebounded slightly after years of layoffs and closures caused mainly by competition from cheap natural gas. And a handful of new mines in Wyoming, Alabama, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are either opening or slated to open in the next few years.\\n\\nThe coal mine Trump referred to is the Acosta Deep Mine in Jennerstown, Pa., about an hour east of Pittsburgh. It is scheduled to have an opening ceremony next week, but there's no word yet on whether the president will be there for the ribbon-cutting.\\n\\nWe're staffing up, George Dethlefsen, CEO of Corsa Coal Corp., which owns the mine, told Bloomberg in February. The mine plans to employ about 70 people.\\n\\nBetty Rhoads, the owner of the nearby Coal Miner's Cafe, in Jennerstown, says she has seen an uptick in business from miners at the mine since last year. You'll see a group of 12 or 20 of them come in and have a big breakfast after their shift is over, she says. It helps the cook get paid. It helps the waitress get paid. It helps us pay our electric bills.\\n\\nThe mine, as are many of the others slated to open, will produce metallurgical coal, a special type of coal that is used in steelmaking. This is different from steam coal, which is used to generate electricity. Met coal makes up about 15 percent of worldwide coal production, according to the International Energy Agency.\\n\\nThe Acosta Deep Mine is one of a handful of metallurgical coal mines opening up around the country to take advantage of very high prices for metallurgical coal, says Art Sullivan, a mining consultant and former coal miner in Washington, Pa.\\n\\nHe says the uptick in met coal is related to events oversees that have little to do with U.S. policy or politics.\\n\\nOne of these factors is that Australia, the far and away leader in metallurgical coal, has experienced disruptions to its supply chain. There have been problems with rail transport of coal, and Cyclone Debbie further hurt the coal industry there, Sullivan says. Those disruptions, combined with greater-than-expected demand for steel in China — the world's leading steelmaker — caused prices of this special coal to soar to $300 per ton, triple the price of met coal from three years ago.\\n\\nWith the disruptions in Australia and continuing high level of demand in China, there has been this upsurge in the U.S. with the planning, development and production from metallurgical coal mines, Sullivan says.\\n\\nJames Stevenson, director of the coal team at IHS Markit, says the metallurgical coal boom has helped the coal industry rebound. The rest of the coal industry has also benefited from higher natural gas prices.\\n\\nI think that the broad-brush characteristic is that things have really improved from the bottom, Stevenson says. We really saw the bottom of the U.S. coal market in early 2016.\\n\\nSince then, the industry has picked up a bit. Several large coal companies have begun to emerge from bankruptcy, buoying the industry.\\n\\nStill, despite this uptick, the industry isn't going back to its glory days of a few years ago, regardless of Trump's pro-coal policies, Stevenson says. He expects natural gas prices to fall and the shortage of met coal to ease. The direction is downward, Stevenson says.\\n\\nThere's not a whole lot a government can do to change economics, so we don't really expect a whole lot of change to the coal demand outlook from what any administration really can do, he says. Most analysts would agree [Trump's pro-coal policies] are probably a case of slowing the decline [rather than generating] any real upside.\\n\\nCoal production reached a 30-year low in 2015, and the number of U.S. coal miners fell from 90,000 in 2012 to 50,000 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of U.S. coal mines dropped from 1,831 in 2006 to 1,159 in 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration.\\n\\nOverall, coal industry analysts say this rebound will pick the industry up, but not to the levels seen at its height around 2011. Blame fracking.\\n\\nNatural gas is the big reason why coal use for electric power has declined, says Jay Apt, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. Apt says natural gas from the fracking boom has replaced coal on the electric grid; natural gas recently overtook coal as the largest source of electricity in the country.\\n\\nA recent Columbia University study found that regulations accounted for 3.5 percent of coal's decline, while competition from natural gas accounted for around 49 percent.\\n\\nTrump's pro-coal policies certainly won't hurt the industry, but the broad trends pushing the industry down are likely to continue, experts say. It's simple economics.\\n\\nReid Frazier is a reporter for The Allegheny Front, a public radio program based in Pittsburgh that covers the environment. You can follow him @reidfrazier."}
{"original": "Women Chefs Still Walk 'A Fine Line' In The Kitchen\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert Featherstone/A Fine Line Robert Featherstone/A Fine Line\\n\\nLess than 7 percent of restaurants in the United States are led by female chefs.\\n\\nThis statistic from a 2014 Bloomberg study came as a huge surprise to Joanna James, a journalist-turned-filmmaker who is also the daughter of a female restaurateur. When she decided to make her first documentary feature film about her mother's journey as a chef, restaurant owner and single mother, she had no idea that her mother's struggles to establish herself in the restaurant industry were commonplace among women.\\n\\nThat film, A Fine Line, began as a love letter to her mom, chronicling the difficulties Val James overcame — from finding bank loans to babysitters — as she established her own restaurant in the early 1990s in central Massachusetts. Eventually the documentary grew into a much bigger story filled with dozens of additional voices from across the industry.\\n\\nI suddenly realized that what my mother had faced was part of a larger discussion, says James. I wanted my mom's story to be the compelling factor that moved everything forward, but to also weave in the stories of other female chefs.\\n\\nAs the scope of the film grew, Joanna James went to Women Chefs & Restaurateurs, a networking association for women in the culinary industry, for financial help in 2016. Chef Ruth Gresser, who owns four restaurants in the Washington, D.C. area and was serving as president of WCR's board of directors at the time, felt it was a project worth supporting.\\n\\nOne of the things that I'm very aware of, says Gresser, is how immensely the food and restaurant business has changed during the 40 years that I've been involved in the industry — yet how little has changed for women during the same time. We need to expand the conversation about supporting women into leadership.\\n\\nThe restaurant industry is generally regarded as unfriendly to women, whether it's frequent sexual harassment in the workplace or nonexistent family leave policies. In the 21st century, women still struggle to advance within restaurant kitchens and can find it next to impossible to find funding to open their own restaurants. This is despite the fact that more than half the students at the Culinary Institute of America are now women.\\n\\nJames and her co-producer, Katy Jordan, are both first-time moms. Now traveling the country sharing the documentary at film festivals and seeking distribution for theatrical release, they have become keenly aware of the struggle to balance work and family. In particular, Jordan was struck by an interview in the film with Michelin-starred chef Barbara Lynch in which Lynch describes coming back to her restaurant just two weeks postpartum.\\n\\nBarbara talks about breastfeeding and butchering at the same time, and it always gets a laugh from the audience, says Jordan. But at the same time, there's something vulgar about that. You get a sense from the women in the audience, no matter what industry they work in, that yes, that's the way it is. That's how you keep your job.\\n\\nIndeed, restaurants are typically known for long work days, often 12 or 14 hours. But the female restaurateurs profiled in the film see no reason why restaurants can't be structured to allow for work-life balance.\\n\\nFirst of all, says Lynch, wherever you choose to work, you need to be treated with dignity.\\n\\nFor Lynch, that might mean helping some of her 400 employees — male and female — with paying off student loans, or providing boxes of groceries for new moms on her staff.\\n\\nAt Val's Restaurant, Val James has an open door policy at her office, where many of her employees refer to her as a second mom.\\n\\nEverybody has their worries, she says. It's always nice to find that person who will sit down with you and say, 'It's going to be OK. Let's figure something out.' \\n\\nBut, as Iron Chef Cat Cora points out, sometimes, it's all about getting the job in the first place.\\n\\nJust 20 years ago, Cora, fresh out of culinary school, wanted to work in a kitchen in France so that she could continue to hone her skills. Instead, she received eight rejection letters, which all stated in no uncertain terms that women simply were not hired to work in the kitchen.\\n\\nNow the owner of several restaurants, she says, They said that to the wrong girl. It just made me more determined to show that I could get into a French kitchen and kill it. It was a turning point for me.\\n\\nFor women of color looking for advancement in the food industry, it can be even more difficult to find opportunities. In the film, African-American chef Mashama Bailey points out that the building that houses her restaurant was once a segregated bus station: When I came into the building, it was really humbling. I know the people who were in this space — going to ride the bus, sitting in that little tiny back waiting room — did not think that someone like me would be a co-owner or be in this space at all running it.\\n\\nIt's one of many moments in A Fine Line that resonated with chef Elle Simone, a food stylist who is also the first African-American cast member on the PBS series America's Test Kitchen and founder of SheChef, a networking group for women of color in the food industry.\\n\\nThere's a lack of representation in the top spots, says Simone, of women in general and women of color in particular. I saw that early on when I was an intern at the Food Network, especially as someone who wasn't coming from one of the big culinary schools, but from a school where all my classmates were black and brown people. I was lucky, but most people at the smaller schools don't even have the opportunity to get those internships, and even when you do, you don't usually see someone in charge who looks like you.\\n\\nMany female chefs believe that offering mentorships and apprenticeships, as well as having women and women of color in leadership positions, is critical to establishing equal opportunities within the workplace and policies that provide more work-life balance. And organizations like the James Beard Foundation and Les Dames d'Escoffier have established programs aimed specifically at helping women advance within the culinary industry.\\n\\nJames and Jordan have also begun connecting with local women legislators and entrepreneurs in the cities where the film has been showing to push for paid maternal leave, early childhood education programs, and equal pay for equal work — issues that they see as critical to helping female chefs gain traction.\\n\\nI think what we need to create, says James, is an 'old girls' club,' with female accountants, tax attorneys, and so forth, who can help women in the culinary field achieve their goals. Good food is important, but it's about so much more than food.\\n\\nA Fine Line will be screened in a number of film festivals around the country this fall."}

For the president, this is an issue that has been a priority since the early days of his campaign. A month after then-candidate Donald Trump announced he was running, in 2015, he traveled to the border city of Laredo, in Texas, to deliver this message.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In certain sections, you have to have a wall. Absolutely.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nTRUMP: And, by the way, the wall - the wall will save you a tremendous amount of money. But you absolutely - there are areas that you have to have the wall.\\n\\nMARTIN: The mayor of Laredo, Peter Saenz (ph), welcomed then-candidate Trump at the time.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPETE SAENZ: We're excited to have Mr. Donald Trump here in Laredo, Texas. It has provided us an opportunity to present to Mr. Trump and his entourage what Laredo's all about.\\n\\nMARTIN: We wanted to learn how the border debate looks from Laredo, so we have called up Mayor Saenz to talk with us this morning. Thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nSAENZ: Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much for invitation, Rachel.\\n\\nMARTIN: Before we move to the present moment, I wonder if you could walk us back to when candidate Trump visited Laredo back in the day when he was running for president. You were able to tell him about the border issues that were facing your city. What did you describe to him?\\n\\nSAENZ: What we did, we described, basically, what Laredo's all about. And we're the No. 1 land port in the entire Americas. We're the No. 2 port, behind Long Beach, as a port, overall port. We do over $200 billion worth of trade, primarily with Mexico. We have a strong relationship - economic and beyond - with Mexico, and this is why it's so sensitive for us here at the border as to how we deal with Mexico. Particularly, trade, you know, in general because we are a logistics warehousing distribution center...\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nSAENZ: ...An important center. We add and bring value to the state of Texas, but, of course, the nation as well. And so...\\n\\nMARTIN: What did you tell him about the wall? Did you agree with him that a wall was a good idea or a bad idea?\\n\\nSAENZ: (Laughter) Well, he asked. And, of course, we told him - he was insisting on this physical wall, and we told him that given the terrain and how the lay of the land there - you know, we have a network of creeks and waterways that actually empty into the river. And it's a rolling topography. It doesn't necessarily lend itself engineering-wise, I think, it doesn't lend itself for a physical wall.\\n\\nAnd I think at that time - and I think you showed, or at least, you presented a part of that interview - he did concede that maybe through natural barriers, that those could serve as a barrier, as well. So but then again, he's been changing his mind on the size and type of fence, or barrier, or wall or whatever.\\n\\nSo anyway, our position there in Laredo is we don't need a physical wall. We have a natural barrier. And we expressed that to him. We consistently kept that position. I'm also the chairman of the Texas Border Coalition, which is really mayors and judges from Brownsville to El Paso, and consistently, we've kept that policy. You know, we could do without a physical wall. We're very much for border security. Believe us. We need border security.\\n\\nMARTIN: That means more agents, better technology, things like that.\\n\\nSAENZ: Yeah. We're proposing this virtual wall concept, which now through technology, more personnel - frankly, we work very closely. We're not a sanctuary city. We work very closely with the federal people there, all agencies, and it's our plan to continue with them. And also clearing the vegetation. We have dense vegetation there by the river banks. And working with Mexico, I personally have a very good, strong relationship with the mayor of Nuevo Laredo, who's our counterpart there at the Laredo port. And they're very open to cooperation, and their willingness to help out on these border issues...\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah. Let me ask you - so you say you don't need a wall. President Trump insists that you do. You are actually not in Texas at this moment. We're talking to you from Washington, D.C. You are here talking with lawmakers about the border issue. Can you tell us who you've spoken with and what those conversations have been like? Is your message getting through?\\n\\nSAENZ: I think so. Or, at least, the attempt is very strong for us. We obviously visited with the people there in Texas - Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz and our congressman, Henry Cuellar. We've been visiting with other new senators and congresspeople that were coming in just to impress on them, you know, the need. President Trump also stated as part of his leveraging momentum here for the wall is that he wanted to close the border.\\n\\nAnd, of course, that would be catastrophic for us as a community, but also our state, state of Texas, and the nation. Millions of jobs depend on cross-border trade and commerce, and we've got to be very careful as to how we approach these things. I would prefer that that type of rhetoric is kept out because it does create all sorts of uncertainty in the markets, and more so in the trade business.\\n\\nMARTIN: Just lastly, the president has asked the Pentagon to deploy troops to the border to build or upgrade existing fencing. Do you think that's a good idea? Do you need that?\\n\\nSAENZ: Not in our area. Maybe in other areas. You know, there's got to be a solution to it, but it's got to be practical. And it's got to be, you know, effective and physically responsible. We personally feel that money could be applied somewhere else. So, you know, we're expecting good things, hopefully in the near future.\\n\\nMARTIN: Mayor Pete Saenz of Laredo, Texas. Thank you so much.\\n\\nSAENZ: Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the time.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

During the call, Trump urged the officials to find more than 11,000 ballots from the Nov. 3 presidential election — enough to swing the state in his favor — and continued to push the debunked notion that the election results were fraudulent.\\n\\nFoley & Lardner said in its statement Monday that the firm had a policy not to represent any party in connection with matters related to elections.\\n\\nOur policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers, it said.\\n\\nAfter The Washington Post released audio from the call earlier this week, the firm said that it was working to understand Mitchell's role in the call.\\n\\nMitchell said in an email to clients and friends that she was leaving Foley & Lardner and blamed her departure on a massive pressure campaign in the last several days mounted by leftist groups via social media and other means against me, my law firm and clients of the law firm, according to The New York Times.\\n\\nIn the email, she vowed to redouble her efforts on election integrity.\\n\\nHer profile on the Foley & Lardner's website had already been deleted by Tuesday night.\\n\\nMitchell was an active participant during the Saturday call with Trump. She complained to Raffensperger that she asked for voting records from his office but hadn't received them. She also claimed that more than 4,000 people voted in Georgia despite having moved out of the state. On the call, Raffensperger's general counsel, Ryan Germany, said that data was incorrect.\\n\\nHe added that, Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately, according to transcripts of the call.\\n\\nMitchell, 70, served as a Democratic representative in the Oklahoma House in the 1970s and 1980s. In recent years, however, she has represented Republican candidates and causes, according to Politico."}

After making their brief comments they departed before the meetings officially started.\\n\\nA White House official had told NPR earlier in the day the administration didn't understand why it might be a problem for Kelly to be present at the meetings, at which top law enforcement and intelligence officials were to present secret information about the Department of Justice Russia probe.\\n\\nI don't see what the issue is, the official told NPR.\\n\\nKelly and the White House have been brokering the conversations since Trump said on Twitter last weekend that he wanted to learn more about the FBI's use of confidential informants to interview campaign aides in 2016.\\n\\nFlood's presence was unexpected.\\n\\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders had said earlier that no one from the White House would attend the resulting conferences, but those arrangements have changed after the back-and-forth up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.\\n\\nCritics charge that Trump has violated the long-standing independence of the Justice Department to pursue investigations without political interference and called it inappropriate for administration officials to join briefings about an investigation that bears so heavily on the president and his aides.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nCongress already has a process by which members can keep themselves informed about the work of the Justice Department and the FBI, said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member on the Senate intelligence committee.\\n\\nSo there was no need, he said, for the briefing at the Justice Department for House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., separate from one at the Capitol for the leaders of the House and Senate and the leaders of the intelligence committees.\\n\\nThe White House's plan to provide a separate briefing for their political allies demonstrates that their interest is not in informing Congress but in undermining an ongoing criminal investigation, Warner said.\\n\\nIf they insist upon carrying out this farce, the White House and its Republican allies in the House will do permanent, long-standing damage to the practice of bipartisan congressional oversight of intelligence, Warner also said.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Nunes and the other members of the intelligence committees are simply doing their work as appropriate.\\n\\nI appreciate the [Justice] Department arranging today's briefing, Ryan said. As always, I cannot and will not comment on a classified session. I look forward to the prompt completion of the intelligence committee's oversight work in this area now that they are getting the cooperation necessary for them to complete their work while protecting sources and methods.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told NPR separately on Thursday that he wouldn't discuss the classified briefing but that he retains confidence in special counsel Robert Mueller and in Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.\\n\\nAt least one source and one method have already been compromised: Press reports revealed that Cambridge professor Stefan Halper met with three Trump campaign aides in 2016 as a confidential informant for the FBI. Investigators wanted to know about the overtures that people on Trump's campaign were receiving from Russian agents.\\n\\nTrump denounced the FBI's use of a secret informant and said that had been tantamount to government-sponsored political snooping for Democrats.\\n\\nA lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign, Trump told reporters on Tuesday. If so, that would be a disgrace to this country. I hope there weren't, frankly ... but some man got paid based on what I read in the newspapers.\\n\\nThe Democrats who took part in the meetings on Thursday — House and Senate Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees, Adam Schiff and Warner — released a collective statement rejecting Trump's claim.\\n\\nNothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a 'spy' in the Trump campaign, or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols.\\n\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by the president last year, responded via Twitter, denouncing attacks on the agency and defending its use of confidential informants as tightly regulated and essential to protecting the country.\\n\\nHe said the president's attacks on the FBI will do lasting damage to our country.\\n\\nNunes and Gowdy had been requesting secret information from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for months about the Russia investigation, and he had resisted. Nunes threatened to try to impeach Rosenstein or hold him in contempt of Congress. The deputy attorney general relented after Trump's demand that the Justice Department comply.\\n\\nNPR correspondents Susan Davis, Sarah McCammon, Scott Neuman and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Killing Or Assassination?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\\n\\nListeners and readers have asked about NPR's policy regarding the use of the word assassination to describe the targeted killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. We asked the newsroom to explain.\\n\\nSoleimani was commander of Iran's Quds Force, an elite unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard; the Trump administration has labeled it a terrorist organization. Its actions led to the injury and deaths of, by the president's account, hundreds of American civilians and military personnel. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike, near the Baghdad airport in neighboring Iraq, last Friday.\\n\\nThe White House had accused Iran of orchestrating the non-deadly attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in the days before Soleimani's death. Crucially, Trump also said that Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. But Trump has also since said that Soleimani should have been taken out a long time ago. And we had a shot at it, and we took him out. Administration officials have repeated the claim that deadly attacks were imminent, but they have as yet offered no details or evidence to back it up.\\n\\nHere's what NPR's newsroom told me. The statement is from Gerry Holmes, NPR's managing editor for enterprise, who is currently overseeing NPR's standards and practices, and Terence Samuel, NPR's managing editor:\\n\\nWe have been having conversations between our reporters and editors in the newsroom about the use of the word assassination describing the killing of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani by U.S. Forces. While we have not mandated the word's use, it has been used in our coverage in headlines and in our stories. We feel it is an appropriate use of the word, which is defined as the killing of a political leader by surprise. We realize there is some debate about the term as it is an illegal act under U.S. law and the current administration does not call Gen. Soleimani's death an assassination. We have addressed the debate in our coverage.\\n\\nAs one NPR listener wrote, objecting to the word's use, Assassination is a strong and inflammatory term.\\n\\nIt is indeed inflammatory, to some, in the current context of political divide. But the relevant principle in the newsroom should be something else: Is it accurate?\\n\\nAssassination has both a common meaning and a legal one. While some dictionaries use the word killed (as Holmes and Samuel did), NPR's dictionary of record (Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition) defines the word this way: To murder (esp. a person who is politically important or is prominent), typically by surprise attack and usually for payment or from zealous belief.\\n\\nThe Associated Press, which NPR generally turns to for style guidance, says: Use the term only if it involves the murder of a politically important or prominent individual by surprise attack.\\n\\nUnlike the newsroom's understanding of the word (the killing of a political leader by surprise), both those definitions incorporate the word murder. And murder itself has both a common meaning (to kill someone) and a legal meaning (an unlawful killing).\\n\\nAs a result, AP itself is not using the word in this case. Its standards editor, John Daniszewski, wrote: The AP has mostly refrained from describing Soleimani's death as an assassination — both because it would require that the news service decide that the act was a murder, and because the term is politically freighted.\\n\\nPolitically freighted should not scare NPR journalists off using a term if it is accurate. But as Holmes and Samuel said, NPR itself has reported (here and here) that legal experts are divided on whether assassination or murder (take your pick) applies here. Even murkier, the domestic and international standards to support the legality of such a killing are different.\\n\\nDaniszewski offered a very detailed look at the legal arguments surrounding Soleimani's killing. I'd urge those who are passionate about this debate over the word assassination to read it closely.\\n\\nHolmes told me he believes we should always be using common definitions and using context and explanation if using a legal one. In the case we're talking about, the 'killing' or 'assassination' was carried out by a foreign government in a sovereign country. This 'killing' was not adjudicated in an American or Iranian court of law, so who gets to define it? Common use seems more appropriate in my view.\\n\\nMe, I'm going to waffle just a bit here, largely because ethics and language issues are not always as clear cut as we would wish or as some might think they are. Targeted killing is just as accurate a description, without pulling punches. But if the administration does not offer more details to back up its claim that Soleimani's killing was meant to deter imminent lethal attacks on U.S. citizens (which would make the legal self-defense argument more potent), then the word assassination seems justified."}

It brought a reminder that even this highly scripted ordeal may include a few surprises after all.\\n\\nSenators did not agree to the first draft of rules proposed by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., notwithstanding his party's control of the chamber and his reputation as a savvy counter of votes.\\n\\nHe had repeatedly insisted that the rules for the trial would be modeled on those for the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.\\n\\nMcConnell also said confidently last week that all the members of the GOP conference backed his approach to have the prosecution and defense lay out their arguments and address written questions before turning to the issue of whether to subpoena witnesses or documents.\\n\\nWhen members of his own conference reviewed the details of his resolution, McConnell was forced to do something he doesn't have to do often — change his plan under pressure from fellow Republicans.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nHis draft resolution stated that each side would present its case in up to 24 hours over two days. His last-minute revision expanded that timing to three days. He also allowed evidence from the House to be automatically entered into the record unless there were an objection.\\n\\nBut while McConnell may have been forced to revise his plans for the overall structure for the trial rules, he was able to stave off several attempts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., later in the day and late into the night on Tuesday. Republicans voted down 11 amendments, mostly to subpoena documents from the White House, State Department and other administration officials. They stuck with McConnell's argument that the issue about witnesses and documents would be addressed after both sides made their case for and against impeachment.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nCollins leads rebels in balking at rules\\n\\nMcConnell is frequently lauded for his political acumen and ability to see around legislative corners. He held firm as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., demanded he set up a fair trial before she sent over the articles of impeachment. He prevailed — she was unable to extract any commitments.\\n\\nThe majority leader also ignored predictable calls from Democrats such as Schumer to allow more than two days for the impeachment managers to make their case.\\n\\nBut he couldn't ignore Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who was among a group of Senate Republicans who insisted that the time be extended.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nSenator Collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the House transcript in the record, her office said in a statement. Her position has been that the trial should follow the [Bill] Clinton model as much as possible. She thinks these changes are a significant improvement.\\n\\nThe fate of McConnell's initial proposed rules represented a very rare defeat at the hands of his own allies and underscored the desire, at least by Collins and a few others, for the Senate not to appear as a partisan rubber stamp.\\n\\nDems, White House spar over witnesses\\n\\nOn that point, at least, Collins and the other rebels broadly agreed with the case made by House impeachment managers about a number of amendments to McConnell's rules.\\n\\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead manager, urged senators to adopt a number of amendments offered by Schumer that would have admitted witnesses and documents into the proceedings.\\n\\nTrump's fate in this phase of impeachment — whether he's convicted or acquitted — will have greater value if Americans believe that the president truly underwent a full and fair trial, Schiff said.\\n\\nAnd that means, he argued, that the Senate must bring in former national security adviser John Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and others who Schiff said would shed more light on the underlying events of the Ukraine affair.\\n\\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone urged senators to reject Schumer's amendments, and he repeated Republicans' long-standing criticisms of the impeachment case generally and Schiff in particular.\\n\\nIt's outrageous! Cipollone said.\\n\\nSchiff and his compatriots, including Democrats Zoe Lofgren of California and Val Demings of Florida, made what were effectively opening arguments against Trump, structured around the evidence they said should be brought into the matter.\\n\\nDemings, for example, detailed the material in the possession of the State Department that she said would strengthen Democrats' case that Trump had abused his power or conditioned his policy toward Ukraine last year on the expectation that its leaders would launch investigations that Trump thought would help him politically.\\n\\nDebate continued until nearly 2 a.m. ET Wednesday as Schumer continually offered amendments seeking testimony or material for the trial — and McConnell and Republicans continued to bat them down. The proceedings resume at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday."}

Can He Get Votes?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andre Chung for The Washington Post/Getty Images Andre Chung for The Washington Post/Getty Images\\n\\nIf you don't live in Baltimore, but you know anything about the mayor's race, it's probably that an activist with Black Lives Matter is running. He's known as the guy in the blue vest, but he also goes by DeRay Mckesson. Mckesson is the city's highest-profile mayoral candidate, but one of the lowest in the polls.\\n\\nThe race for Baltimore's next mayor was shaken up a year ago, following the death of Freddie Gray, the young black man fatally injured in police custody. After violent protests, current Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she would not run again. Now, well over a dozen candidates are competing, and because of the city's past voting record, the winner of this month's Democratic primary will almost certainly become the next mayor.\\n\\nAlthough that probably won't be 30-year-old Mckesson — he registered less than 1 percent in a recent poll by the University of Baltimore and the Baltimore Sun — he has been fielding a steady stream of national interviews. I find him working out of a trendy coffee shop, where he has run into some former colleagues.\\n\\nWoo! His friend cheers, as they pose for a selfie that Mckesson posts online.\\n\\nMckesson has about as many Twitter followers — more than 300,000 — as there are registered voters in Baltimore, and he sneaks peeks at his phone throughout our interview. It's a following built since August 2014, when he heard about the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\\n\\nI packed three T-shirts, four pairs of underwear, one pair of socks, and like, I was there, he says.\\n\\nMckesson ended up leaving a six-figure job as a school administrator in Minnesota to protest police brutality full time. After the death of Freddie Gray, this mission brought him back to his hometown of Baltimore. Mckesson, the son of two recovering drug addicts, grew up in Baltimore until he went to middle school. Now he says he wants to shift his focus again from staging protests to bringing concrete change to people's lives.\\n\\nWe can make a strategy to address adult literacy today, he says. We can change the way that we police and think about safety today. And the local level is where, most often, those changes have the most impact.\\n\\nMckesson has gotten props for his detailed policy papers. But it's his activism that has drawn national attention, from a White House meeting with President Obama to an appearance on Stephen Colbert's show, with his trademark smartphone in hand. He's trying to leverage this attention and his social media savvy to amplify traditional retail politics. Mckesson says people will direct message him on Twitter to say they'll gather 50 friends at their house if he shows up.\\n\\nWhen I Periscope house visits or house parties, when I do Facebook Live, we average a few thousand people who look at all of that every time, he says.\\n\\nBut the vast majority of his followers are not registered Baltimore voters.\\n\\nCan he take all that social media and fame nationally, and turn it into a ground game? asks Roger Hartley, who is dean of the University of Baltimore's College of Public Affairs. So far, the answer is a resounding no.\\n\\nHartley says that for one thing, Mckesson entered the race at the last possible moment — months after the others. What's more, his many rivals are also talking about policing and inequality.\\n\\nAnd they have served, he says. They have a record. They have won elections in those districts.\\n\\nThe front-runner is state Sen. Catherine Pugh, who has touted her role on state and national police reform commissions.\\n\\nWorking with the state is really important in terms of how we reform the police department, how we create opportunities, and how we lift some of the issues that are painful in this city, she said during a March 22 debate on Baltimore affiliate WJZ.\\n\\nBehind her in the latest poll is former Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon, whose experience cuts both ways. Dixon has faced jabs over a 2009 embezzlement conviction, though in the WJZ debate, she said that doesn't define her.\\n\\nMy plans are very clear, she said in the forum. I can hit the ground running the first day in office.\\n\\nIn a gentrifying midtown neighborhood, 23-year-old business student Becca McKenny is excited to vote. But she's been looking to social media to research candidates and is frustrated there's not more information out there.\\n\\nI mean, hey, make a YouTube video, she says. Make a short, do a skit. People are very artsy here in Baltimore.\\n\\nI am totally expecting McKenny to say she supports Mckesson. But I am wrong.\\n\\nSheila Dixon has been out there, she's been hitting the streets, she says. She even visited my apartment complex. That was late last summer. McKenny says she was impressed by Dixon and considers her embezzlement conviction small potatoes.\\n\\nMcKenny was among those who protested after Freddie Gray's arrest and death last April, and says it feels as if not much has changed in the year since. I got pulled over by the police, she says. Coming home from school, 10 at night, with — you see my pink neon backpack. And why?\\n\\nA short drive away, near Gray's neighborhood, Brian Mcalily wants a new mayor to change the way police treat people.\\n\\nDo like we used to do in the old days, he says. The police need to come out here and shake hands with everybody, get to know the neighborhood.\\n\\nPolitical analyst Roger Hartley says there's widespread frustration. With a lame duck mayor and at least a third of the City Council also set to change, he says it has left a vacuum.\\n\\nNot a lot has been done and it's almost like there's been a hold button placed right now, to see who's going to be the next leadership, he says.\\n\\nThe Democratic primary is April 26, and Baltimore's next mayor may face a leadership test soon after. The trials of the police officers charged with Freddie Gray's death have also been on hold and are set to start again next month."}

Get the money flowing\\n\\nAll the way back in September, CDC Director Robert Redfield testified in Congress that the time is now to get billions of dollars for COVID-19 vaccine distribution out to states.\\n\\nBut that didn't happen, and public health officials say the delay in federal funding is in part to blame for the slow start of the vaccination campaign. This week, the federal government announced that some of the nearly $9 billion included in the December COVID-19 relief package is on its way to states.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to getting that money, which will be critical for several aspects of our response, Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's secretary of health and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told NPR in a press briefing. She says the money will be used to contract companies to run community vaccination clinics and execute on a vaccine public awareness campaign.\\n\\nKansas health secretary Dr. Lee Norman says the money will allow his state to purchase some vehicles for mobile vaccination, to bring on additional personnel and do outreach to communities of color.\\n\\nOfficials expect that it's going to take at least three weeks for that money to get from the CDC to the states, and then more time to get to the front line of the vaccine effort. When it arrives, experts expect the campaign to ramp up quickly.\\n\\n2. Bring in more vaccines\\n\\nThe two vaccines currently authorized in the U.S. — made by Pfizer and Moderna — are complicated to handle. They're both frozen — one requires storage at ultracold temperatures and dilution in the field — they require patients to be observed for at least 15 minutes after getting their shot, and patients need to return several weeks later for a second dose.\\n\\nThe complexity has slowed things down, and new, simpler vaccine candidates on the horizon could help.\\n\\nProviders point out that clinical guidance for how to properly administer the two available vaccines came out at the same time that doses were arriving.\\n\\nIt's not that the vaccines are rolling off the trucks and we're able to administer it immediately, says Dr. Jinlene Chan, deputy secretary of public health services at the Maryland Department of Health. Training is important to make sure that we deliver the right amount of vaccines for every individual and do it in a safe manner and as efficiently as possible without waste.\\n\\nEven as health care workers get the hang of handling these Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, officials are looking ahead to other promising vaccine candidates that would add to the available supply.\\n\\nWe have heard that both Johnson & Johnson as well as AstraZeneca plan to submit their proposals for an [Emergency Use Authorization] by the end of this month or in February, says Levine of ASTHO. We'll see how the science is and what the FDA and the CDC decide — but potentially the distribution of more vaccines, especially the one-dose Johnson and Johnson [vaccine], would ramp things up significantly.\\n\\nNeither of these vaccines have the ultracold storage requirements that the Pfizer vaccine does — they can be kept at refrigerator or freezer temperatures for longer, giving planners much more flexibility.\\n\\nJason Schwartz, health policy professor at Yale University, agrees that there's a lot of enthusiasm for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. A one-dose vaccine would be a game changer for the vaccination program here in the United States in the months ahead, he says.\\n\\nSince many vaccine candidates are already being manufactured and can be ready to go once federal health agencies give the green light, the stock of vaccine that's available could increase very quickly.\\n\\nAnd once there are more vaccine doses to go around, we can distribute more generously to doctors' offices, federally qualified health care centers, rural health centers, chain pharmacies, retail pharmacies, community pharmacies — we can't distribute to all of those places if we don't have enough quantity, says Kentucky public health commissioner Dr. Steven Stack.\\n\\n3. Open up the 'mega-sites'\\n\\nSo far, the vaccines have been mostly delivered to hospitals to reach front-line health workers and long-term care facilities for residents and staff.\\n\\nBut several states, including New Jersey and Texas, are starting up mega-sites — vaccination clinics designed to vaccinate hundreds or thousands of people each day. More of these venues will likely crop up across the country as federal funding allows health officials to hire temporary staff and pay for space and supplies, and as soon as the supply of vaccine is steady enough to keep these clinics stocked at full volume.\\n\\nThere should be mass vaccination clinics in high school gymnasiums, convention centers and mall parking lots in every county in America, says Yale's Schwartz. These types of sites will be essential as the pool of people eligible to get vaccinated expands.\\n\\nThe key to making this work at the scale needed is federal funding and logistical support, Schwartz argues, since hospitals are already overstretched caring for COVID-19 patients, and local and state governments don't have the money to pull it off on their own.\\n\\n4. Make the supply more predictable\\n\\nIf vaccine providers have doses of vaccine ready to go, but no one is scheduled to receive them, that's a problem. It's also a problem if there are patients scheduled — but no vaccine.\\n\\n[Once], our Moderna shipment just didn't show up; we have no idea where it went, says Dr. Grace Lee, a medical officer at Stanford Children's Hospital who serves as a vaccine adviser for the CDC and California. We were planning around those doses, so we had to slow down for a little bit.\\n\\nA match between supply and demand is key to making the vaccination campaign go smoothly. There was a major hiccup at the federal level early on: General Gus Perna, the logistics lead of Operation Warp Speed, had to apologize for telling states that more vaccine would be available than was actually ready to go. State and local officials say predictability has gotten better, but there are still inconsistencies.\\n\\nA steadier supply of vaccine doses would help vaccine providers plan so that there are patients ready to go for every dose that comes in.\\n\\n5. Unleash the public awareness campaigns\\n\\nThere's one more key to a speedy vaccine rollout: a public ready and eager to get vaccinated. Health officials in Kentucky, Ohio and other states say that hesitancy has slowed down their vaccination campaigns.\\n\\nTo combat misinformation and reassure the public that the vaccines are safe and effective, comprehensive public awareness campaigns will be crucial. That includes national efforts from the incoming Biden administration and a $50 million ad campaign planned by the Ad Council, alongside state and local efforts to get the word out.\\n\\nStates need to have vaccine confidence outreach teams that are fully resourced to go out into communities and educate members of the public about the importance of these vaccines, says Dr. Kelly Moore, deputy director of the nonprofit advocacy group the Immunization Action Coalition. Those teams will need to answer their questions, to dispel myths, to encourage them to make a decision to be vaccinated and to communicate with them about how they receive the vaccine in their own state.\\n\\nThe effort needs to be state-specific since every state has a slightly different distribution plan, says Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at NACCHO, the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Otherwise, people are watching the nightly news and really trying to figure out, 'Why do these people have access but these people [in another state] don't?' \\n\\nIn Michigan, at the Washtenaw County Health Department, there's a team dedicated to answering emails and calls about vaccine distribution. We've been inundated for weeks now with questions about 'When and where can I get my vaccine?'  says spokesperson Susan Ringler-Cerniglia. It's been a challenge because people want and expect us to be able to tell them this date and this time, and we're just not there yet.\\n\\nAs the long-awaited federal funding comes in and health departments are able to ramp up vaccine administration and activate their communication plans, they're hoping to be able to get those answers out to the public soon.\\n\\nRob Stein and Allison Aubrey contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Devastating Wildfires Force California's Largest Utility To Plan Sale Of Gas Assets\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Noah Berger/AP Noah Berger/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 6:29 p.m. ET\\n\\nFacing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires, the parent company of California's largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company, NPR has learned.\\n\\nInternally, Pacific Gas & Electric has dubbed this strategy Project Falcon. Under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.\\n\\nAll net proceeds from the sale of PG&E's gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\\n\\nThe company also is exploring selling key real estate assets, including its San Francisco headquarters, and moving its operations elsewhere in the Bay Area, the sources say.\\n\\nOn Friday, the company announced it would bereviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs. In addition, PG&E said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety.\\n\\nPG&E declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on Project Falcon. A written statement from spokesman Andy Castagnola said, Safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders. PG&E remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild — and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires.\\n\\nWildfire damages\\n\\nIn June, the state's fire agency, Cal Fire, determined that PG&E power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across Northern California in 2017. And now, regulators are investigating whether PG&E equipment sparked November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history.\\n\\nThe company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.\\n\\nEquity analysts project that PG&E's damages from the wildfires could exceed PG&E's market value and its insurance coverage. One Citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook for up to $15 billion in damages.\\n\\nInsurance companies Allstate, State Farm and USAA have filed lawsuits against PG&E, blaming the utility for the Camp Fire.\\n\\nThe gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency, the California Public Utilities Commission, which has already expressed deep concerns about PG&E's shoddy safety record, lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state's ratepayers.\\n\\nSo far, state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of PG&E's planning loop for Project Falcon, named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company's headquarters.\\n\\nThe current and former PG&E officials say they're speaking with NPR out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers, safety and the state. There's a public trust element in being a utility monopoly, said the senior company official.\\n\\nBailout?\\n\\nPG&E is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy. But given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout, Michael Wara, a lawyer and research scholar at Stanford University, calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing.\\n\\nThey need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for Californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they're not being totally transparent, especially in the current context where there's a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by PG&E's infrastructure, Wara said.\\n\\nWhat California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.\\n\\nWara added, What California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.\\n\\nWall Street wants to see hard thinking, too.\\n\\nSteve Fleishman, senior utilities analyst and a managing director at Wolfe Research, said PG&E's plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear. They clearly seem to be more at risk for that, Fleishman said. This kind of risk profile is not sustainable.\\n\\nPG&E's stock is down about 50 percent since the Camp Fire broke out on Nov. 8.\\n\\nConsumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency.\\n\\nAnything PG&E wants to propose should be done in an open, public manner and include a comprehensive, coherent wildfire mitigation strategy, says Mark Toney, the executive director of The Utility Reform Network.\\n\\nThere is widespread anger in the state over PG&E's shoddy safety record. Protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company's San Francisco headquarters, where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the Camp Fire and 2017's wildfires in Napa and Sonoma counties. At one customer service center, the company has installed bulletproof glass.\\n\\n'Serious safety problems'\\n\\nIn late December, state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility's role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires.\\n\\nPG&E has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years, the California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement.\\n\\nPossible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company's return on equity contingent on safety performance.\\n\\nWe must be careful and practical, the commission's president, Michael Picker, said in a statement last month. This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\\n\\nThe commission declined further comment for this story. A spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility.\\n\\nWe must be careful and practical. This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\\n\\nIn a separate development, the state's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, said in a court filing in late December that PG&E could face criminal charges up to murder if it's found liable in any of the recent deadly California wildfires.\\n\\nPG&E was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a San Francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood. The federal judge overseeing the utility's five-year criminal probation in that case had asked Becerra's opinion on whether PG&E's possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation.\\n\\nThe stakes\\n\\nA sale would have big implications for the company, which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million California households and has more than 20,000 employees. PG&E's natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company.\\n\\nThe company sources who spoke to NPR and provided supporting documents say the planning for Project Falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past June, when Cal Fire determined that PG&E was responsible for at least a dozen Northern California fires. The planning, the sources say, has accelerated since the Camp Fire.\\n\\nThe sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.\\n\\nCalifornia applies inverse condemnation to utilities, meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent.\\n\\nStructuring the deal\\n\\nPG&E shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover, at least in part, wildfire liabilities.\\n\\nAs part of the gas sale plan, all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash, according to the PG&E source. But shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm.\\n\\nRegulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers.\\n\\nWe need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale, warns Wara, the Stanford researcher.\\n\\nThe inside sources say the company is hoping to get between $10.7 billion and $15.5 billion for its gas assets. Given the company's safety, liability and political challenges — including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations — analysts say it's not at all clear they would get that on the open market.\\n\\nIn mid-December, state regulators found that PG&E had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five-year period.\\n\\nAt the time, PG&E spokesman Matt Nauman said in an emailed statement to NPR that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn't live up to that commitment in this case.\\n\\nThis comes on the heels of a $1.6 billion fine from regulators — the largest in state history — and six felony convictions related to 2010 San Bruno explosion.\\n\\nTravis Miller, senior utilities equity strategist at Morningstar, is skeptical that a potential gas sell-off would fly with regulators or Wall Street. He said he doesn't think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets.\\n\\nYou may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk, Miller says. There's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.\\n\\nProject Falcon and the Camp Fire\\n\\nThe company's fiscal woes deepened in the wake of November's Camp Fire in Butte County, Calif., which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis. Paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out.\\n\\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state's fire agency Cal Fire. PG&E has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the Camp Fire erupted.\\n\\nThe company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the Camp Fire, including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance. In one lawsuit, residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety.\\n\\nNow it's clear there are problems on both sides of the business, says Steve Fleishman, an analyst with Wolfe Research, referring to the gas and electric divisions.\\n\\nFleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow PG&E leaders to focus solely on improving safety. I think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety, Fleishman says.\\n\\nAnalysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital, not just because of present liability, but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires, a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation's forests.\\n\\nThe company in November said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines. And the ratings agencies, Moody's Investor Service and S&P, have downgraded the company's credit rating to near junk status.\\n\\nApproval process will be complicated\\n\\nInternal PG&E planning documents on the potential sale, labeled privileged and confidential, show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval.\\n\\nThe CPUC approval process will be complicated and lengthy, so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable, one document reads.\\n\\nWhile the gas sale would cover some liabilities, the legislature also may be asked to step in. State lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout.\\n\\nAnalysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond, putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook.\\n\\nUltimately, we're going to be left holding the bag, says Michael Wara of Stanford University. If PG&E can't pay all of these costs, then it's the California taxpayer that ultimately will.\\n\\nBut some lawmakers are already balking.\\n\\nState Sen. Bill Dodd, who originally supported shielding PG&E from liability costs related to fires in 2017, has lost patience with the company.\\n\\nPG&E has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across California, Dodd said in an emailed statement. He called for systemic change, which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite."}

Now, Judge Shirley Strickland Saffold is suing the newspaper for $50 million, saying it violated her privacy.\\n\\nThe commenter used the name Lawmiss and posted more than 80 comments on the site. But the comments raised the suspicions of an online staffer at the Plain Dealer, who, when investigating the pseudonym, stumbled on an e-mail address linked to Saffold.\\n\\nAlready under suspicion for her Web comments, Saffold won't talk about her suit against the paper, but her lawyer Brian Spitz doesn't deny that she sometimes used the name Lawmiss.\\n\\nBut, he says, Judge Saffold commented on nothing that's currently — or has ever been — pending in her court.\\n\\nThose comments, Spitz contends, were actually written by Saffold's 23-year-old daughter. The judge says they shared the AOL e-mail address.\\n\\nThe Meaning Of 'Anonymous'\\n\\nBut it's the release of her online identity that's the basis of Judge Saffold's $50 million suit against the Plain Dealer. Spitz argues that the paper violated privacy policies when it revealed Saffold's identity.\\n\\nEither the Plain Dealer breached its promise to keep that information confidential, or it never intended to keep it confidential, Spitz says. So it's either a breach of contract or fraud.\\n\\nThe Web site's policy states: we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose.\\n\\nNow that the suit has been filed, Plain Dealer editor Susan Goldberg won't discuss it, but speaking on NPR's On the Media recently, she defended the paper's publication of Saffold's identity, saying it was in the public interest.\\n\\nWhat keeps getting lost in this debate is the right of this defendant, who's on trial for his life, for a fair and impartial judge, Goldberg says, referring to accused killer Anthony Sowell, whose trial starts in June.\\n\\nComments More Controversial Than The Case\\n\\nThe case against the Plain Dealer is adding to an already messy situation.\\n\\nA few days before Saffold sued the Plain Dealer, Sowell's attorney, Rufus Sims, confronted Saffold about reports in the paper about the postings, including one that said he acts like a buffoon. The exchange was posted on the Plain Dealer's Web site.\\n\\nJudge, after reading that article, it was shocking! Sims reportedly said. And, I couldn't believe what I was reading! And, I couldn't believe that that generated from your AOL account, your honor.\\n\\nOK, so that makes it even more of a reason for you to know it wasn't me, Saffold reportedly responded.\\n\\nSaffold says she will decide soon whether to recuse herself from the case. Law professor Jackie Lipton of Case Western Reserve University thinks she needs to in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\\n\\nShe probably should recuse herself from the cases she's commented on, but that, to me, is a separate issue to how the information was released in the first place.\\n\\nDigital Frontier Trips Up Judges, Newspapers\\n\\nSaffold is just the latest judge to find herself in the minefield that is the Internet.\\n\\nA North Carolina judge was slapped with a reprimand last year after he communicated by Facebook with a defense lawyer trying a case before him. Also last year, a judge running for re-election in Washington state was accused of using a government computer to post disparaging remarks about his competitors. He lost re-election.\\n\\nKelly McBride of the Poynter Institute says Saffold's case comes as news organizations debate their online comment rules.\\n\\nNewsrooms all over the place are reconsidering how they allow citizens to be involved in the news, McBride says. I don't think many newsrooms will get rid of comments.\\n\\nAnd, for now, the Plain Dealer is still allowing supposedly anonymous comments on its Web site, while Saffold decides her next move."}
{"original": "Biden Outperforming Sanders In Counties With Lower Incomes, More Voters Of Color\\n\\nA month after the Iowa caucuses, Super Tuesday offered up the first look at how a diverse swath of the country could vote in the Democratic presidential primary race.\\n\\nNow that more than 1,200 counties across 18 states have voted, a clearer picture is emerging of whom different segments of the Democratic voter base are backing.\\n\\nTake, for example, the split among counties with high and low unemployment rates. In those with relatively low unemployment — less than 4% — voters split almost evenly between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But voters in counties with high unemployment — above 7.2% — supported Biden far more often than Sanders.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nIt's a contradiction that may also be a hurdle for Sanders: He's running on a platform of free health insurance and free college, but the places where he's doing best have higher rates of people with bachelor's degrees and health insurance coverage. Biden is doing better at the other end of the spectrum.\\n\\nMeasuring votes by county demographics has its limitations. There are, of course, wealthy people in poor counties, and there are people of color in predominantly white counties. A traditional way to try to solve this problem is with exit polling, which uses surveys to estimate the attitudes of subsets of voters. But exit polls are just that — estimates — while voting totals show the raw numbers of how voters split.\\n\\nNPR used the Census Bureau's American Community Survey data joined with Associated Press election results to determine vote totals by county demographics.\\n\\nNeither former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg nor Sen. Elizabeth Warren came close to the front-runners in any of the demographic splits post-Super Tuesday. Bloomberg announced on Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign, and he joined fellow former candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar in endorsing Biden. Warren suspended her campaign Thursday and has not endorsed any of the remaining candidates.\\n\\nIn the once-crowded Democratic primary field, Biden had staked his position in the race as being the candidate who would appeal most to black Americans. After his underwhelming performance in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are more than 90% white, the importance of that was clear. Post-Super Tuesday data show that in those counties that were most white, Sanders narrowly beat out Biden.\\n\\nBut the former vice president fared better in counties with higher percentages of nonwhite residents, beating Sanders in those counties. Sanders still held his own though — in part because of the large Latino vote in California, a state the senator won.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nThe differences were more drastic by education level. Nearly half of voters in counties with the lowest education levels choose Biden. He beat Sanders by 27 percentage points in those counties.\\n\\nCounties with higher education levels cast the majority of votes through Super Tuesday because of their larger populations. And in these places it was much closer: Biden beat Sanders by just 4 percentage points.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nBiden and Sanders also fared roughly the same among the counties with the highest rates of health insurance. But Biden did better than Sanders in counties with low rates of health insurance — despite the senator's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act health care policy with a Medicare for All system.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nOf all the county breakdowns analyzed, Biden had his strongest showing among residents of counties with low median household incomes (less than $42,200). He earned 50% of that vote, while Sanders earned less than half that.\\n\\nIn the wealthiest counties, Biden beat Sanders by just 3 percentage points.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nAll data are from Associated Press vote counts and the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey."}

Babbitt, an Air Force veteran from the San Diego area.\\n\\nShe was among the rioters who stormed the Capitol building.\\n\\nBabbitt, 35, was one of four people who died during Wednesday's chaotic events, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). MPD Police Chief Robert Contee said the three others who died experienced unspecified medical emergencies.\\n\\nBabbitt's social media profiles indicate that she had most recently worked at a pool service company in Southern California. The military confirmed to NPR that she was also a veteran of the United States Air Force, where she most recently achieved the rank of senior airman. Babbitt entered active duty with the military in 2004, serving until 2008. After that, she served with the Air Force reserve from 2008 to 2010, and the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2016. During her service, she received the Iraq Campaign Medal, indicating she served there in support of the U.S. war.\\n\\nShe saw first hand through her multiple deployments overseas how others were treated and was grateful to have the freedoms we have in America, her ex-husband and fellow Air Force veteran, Timothy McEntee, told NPR by email.\\n\\nBabbitt was a libertarian and supporter of President Trump, according to her social media posts, as well as a follower of the far-right conspiracy theory known as QAnon. The Anti-Defamation League describes QAnon as a wide-reaching conspiracy theory popular among a range of right-wing extremists and states the movement has marked undertones of antisemitism and xenophobia.\\n\\nBabbitt frequently retweeted far-right figures like the pro-Trump lawyer L. Lin Wood, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\\n\\nMcEntee told NPR that Babbitt was known for her outspoken political views.\\n\\nShe had a personality that you either loved or hated, he wrote. She wasn't apologetic about it ... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American.\\n\\nI will be in DC on the 6th! she posted in the days leading up to Wednesday's planned demonstrations. God bless America and WWG1WGA. That acronym — meaning, Where We Go One, We Go All — is a slogan of the QAnon movement.\\n\\nVideo of the shooting shows a chaotic scene inside the Capitol building that suddenly turned bloody.\\n\\nBabbitt is seen on the footage inside the Capitol wearing a backpack and Trump flag among a large group of rioters. When she approaches a window, a shot is heard and she falls back onto the floor.\\n\\nA witness to the shooting told the TV station WUSA9 that a number of police and Secret Service were saying, 'get down, get back, get out of the way.' She didn't heed the call. At that point, the witness said, they shot her in the neck. (NPR was unable to independently contact the witness, but he also appears in footage of the shooting itself.)\\n\\nAs protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female, the United States Capitol Police wrote in a statement on Thursday.\\n\\nMedical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.\\n\\nA law enforcement official told NPR that Babbitt was unarmed.\\n\\nMembers of Babbitt's family expressed shock at the news.\\n\\nI'm numb. I'm devastated. Nobody from DC notified my son and we found out on TV, Ashli Babbitt's mother-in-law, Robin Babbitt, told the New York Post.\\n\\nHer laugh was infectious and her smile would brighten up any dark situation, Timothy McEntee told NPR. Her loss won't be an easy pill to swallow. I'm struggling myself to accept she's no longer with us.\\n\\nThe Capitol Police along with the MPD are investigating the shooting, and the officer who killed Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy.\\n\\nRegardless of the outcome of that investigation, on Wednesday, Mayor Muriel Bowser blamed President Trump for the circumstances that led to Babbitt's death.\\n\\nHis constant and divisive rhetoric led to the abhorrent actions we saw, said Bowser. And sadly it led to a loss of life that will forever stain what could have been and what should have been a peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nNPR's Carrie Johnson contributed to this report."}

A large group of people from Honduras made it across the border to Guatemala. And for some, Mexico would be next. Beyond that, the border of the United States. Journalist Maria Martin is in Antigua, Guatemala, and joins us now with the latest. Good morning.\\n\\nMARIA MARTIN: Good morning, Steve.\\n\\nINKSEEP: What has happened at the Honduras-Guatemala border?\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, what's been going on for the last two days is that maybe as many as 9,000 migrants were able to get through the border this weekend when their numbers overwhelmed security guards at the border. So many of these migrants are young men carrying nothing but a small backpack. But there are also families, women pushing strollers with little babies and some older people in wheelchairs. For most of Monday, there was a standoff between the Guatemalan security forces and the migrants who were blocking a major highway between the two countries. And the migrants were given an ultimatum to move. Now the Guatemalan government says that the migrants have been dispersed. Some have been transported back to Honduras. And others have broken off from the main group and are trying to make their way north to Mexico, then to the U.S. But the Mexican government vows not to let the migrants enter their territory.\\n\\nINKSEEP: These sound like the actions of desperate people. What conditions are they fleeing?\\n\\nMARTIN: They're very desperate people. They're very low-income. They left this area in Honduras. And, of course, Honduras is one of the poorest, most violent, most corrupt countries in the Americas and one of the areas hardest hit by the two hurricanes that struck in October and November and of course, by the pandemic. I spoke with Father Ismael Moreno, who runs an independent radio station in the region.\\n\\nISMAEL MORENO: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nMARTIN: With the hurricanes, says Father Melo, and with the pandemic, Hondurans were left without jobs, homes, with no opportunities to get ahead. So many of the migrants say there's nothing for them in Honduras, that they would be prepared to do anything, that faced with a life of misery, violence and corruption in Honduras, that if they get sent back, they might try again.\\n\\nINKSEEP: Although, of course, the pandemic has been going for many months. The hurricanes were last fall. Do you have any sense of why they would be moving now, just as Joe Biden is about to take office in the United States? Is that a pure coincidence?\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, really, there were more caravans during the Trump administration because people see that this is a safety in numbers for them, cheaper than paying a smuggler. Many, of course, do see hope for better treatment of migrants under Biden. But the timing, I think, has more to do with the devastations of the hurricanes that were in November. Then came, you know, Christmas. Then it's a new year, and it's time to come up. And of course, this is due to, as Father Melo says, the desperation and the misery of so many Hondurans.\\n\\nINKSEEP: It's just a reminder, I suppose, that people are driven not necessarily by policies in the United States, but by that desperation back home.\\n\\nMARTIN: That's right. That's right. It was a new year. And they saw nothing left for them. Nothing was working in terms of getting any help from their government or hope for that.\\n\\nINKSEEP: Maria Martin, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.\\n\\nMARTIN: Thank you.\\n\\nINKSEEP: Journalist Maria Martin speaking in Antigua, Guatemala.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Week In Politics: Sessions Recuses Himself From Campaign Investigations\\n\\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks to political commentators, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. They discuss Trump's speech to Congress.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nAll right we're going to get past the media strategy and into some substance with our Friday regulars, columnist David Brooks of The New York Times. Hey there, David.\\n\\nDAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Hello.\\n\\nCORNISH: And E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Welcome back to the studio.\\n\\nE J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to be with you.\\n\\nCORNISH: So I want to go back to the issue of Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. Here's what he said yesterday about why he had to recuse himself from any ongoing or future investigations.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJEFF SESSIONS: When you evaluate the rules, I feel like I should not be involved investigating a campaign I had role in.\\n\\nCORNISH: And this is over the issue of contacts with Russia in the Trump campaign. But this is not the take that the administration had at the start of the day. So here's what Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in the morning on Fox & Friends.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOX AND FRIENDS)\\n\\nSEAN SPICER: There's nothing to recuse himself. He is 100 percent straight with the committee. And I think that people who are choosing to play partisan politics with this should be ashamed of themselves.\\n\\nCORNISH: So even now, even as Sessions has recused himself, you still hear the president, through his tweets, basically saying, this is sour grapes, basically saying, this is a witch hunt. David Brooks, for you, what's the problem with that strategy? Like, how long can you keep saying there's no there there?\\n\\nBROOKS: Well, you know, I don't know if there's a there there. Never underestimate the possibility for Washington people to have pointless meetings. And it could be Jeff Sessions had a pointless meeting with Cislyak (ph) the Russian ambassador - or Kislyak. And it could've just been one of those get-togethers that happens all the time. On the other hand, there are so many points of contact between Trump - various Trump persona and the Russians that it's like a Seurat painting - the points are beginning to look like something.\\n\\nAnd, to me, the crucial - two crucial questions, which are completely unanswered at this point - there's, one, did the Trump people know something about the Russian campaign - the WikiLeaks campaign - during the campaign? Two, do the Russians have something on Trump, whether in the form of some blackmail information, or are they so heavily invested in his companies that he has reason to pay attention to Russia? Those are the two open questions in my mind.\\n\\nCORNISH: And later in the program, we're actually going to hear from Congressman Adam Schiff from the Intel Committee in the House about that. But E.J., you talked about this episode essentially showing the first cracks in the wall of like kind of congressional Republican support because it's been a wall of support, right? Like, whatever he does, it's like we're going to back it.\\n\\nDIONNE: Well, as soon as this Session's news broke, you had Republican members of Congress saying, OK, now he has to recuse himself. You just didn't see that before. Jason Chaffetz was one of them. And to have Chaffetz...\\n\\nCORNISH: And he's head of the House Oversight Committee.\\n\\nDIONNE: Right. And he's been so loyal. That would be like - I don't know - Bill Belichick turning on Tom Brady for a moment. I mean, it was just very...\\n\\nCORNISH: All gets back to football.\\n\\nDIONNE: I can't resist. The, you know - and so that's striking. But I think the problem the Trump people have is they cannot talk straight about Russia. If Jeff Sessions had had a couple of meetings with the ambassador and hadn't gone out of his way to tell Al Franken on the committee in response to a question that didn't even ask him whether he had had any meetings that in fact he had had no meetings, this wouldn't be nearly as big a story.\\n\\nIf Michael Flynn had not lied about exactly what had gone on, I'm not sure he would have survived, but they just can't seem to talk straight about this. And so they create a strong sense that they're hiding something. And Trump contributes to that by blowing up every time that the Russia story comes up. He had actually maintained a Lenten fast on Twitter, and it just blew apart with this story.\\n\\nCORNISH: Now I want to turn back to the speech earlier this week. Here's a clip of the president addressing Congress.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every hurting family can find healing and hope.\\n\\nCORNISH: Every problem can be solved. So David Brooks, you looked at this through the lens of Trumpism. Who can solve those problems? What's the role of government in that?\\n\\nBROOKS: Yeah, I thought it was interesting because you got to see Trumpism the thing without Trump the clownish behavior. So it was like a straight-on view - our first sort of straight-on view. What struck me first was how un-Republican it was. The Republican Party has had three big units, all of whom were repudiated by the speech. Social conservatives got nary a mention. Fiscal hawks - he's spending a lot of money. Foreign policy hawks - he does not believe in a lot of our alliances. But what he believes in is a strong government. He's - it's for a lot of big government. But it's very forceful father figure, very rough government against their enemies.\\n\\nAnd the way I put it in the - one of my columns today was that he's privatized compassion and nationalized intimidation. And what I mean by that is all the compassionate realms of government that help people in trouble - he's cutting them. All that tough - he got tough-man type parts of government - he's spending a lot more money on. So we're going to get a lot stronger government but maybe a little rougher one.\\n\\nCORNISH: E.J. you disagreed with people who were painting this as some kind of sunny turn by the president (laughter). Though, you noted that he was - you said he was throwing bones of optimism to his party.\\n\\nDIONNE: Yeah, I shuddered at the thought of Trump as a father figure wondering, what kind of father is that with this roughness? I thought this was the old vinegar in a new bottle. He got a lot of credit he didn't deserve just because he showed he could spend one disciplined hour in relationship - in a relationship with the teleprompter, that what he was trying to do here is continue to scare the daylights out of the country to justify strong leadership and aggrandizing power. He talks about wide-open borders, gang members, drug dealers, criminals. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.\\n\\nAnd his own aids were surprised at the good reviews, according to my colleague Robert Costa, because they thought this was purer Trumpism than the establishment media suggested. And I actually for one time agree with them on that.\\n\\nCORNISH: I want to mention one quick thing. We just have a little time left. But he did throw a bone behind the idea of tax credits being swapped out for the current subsidies used for Obamacare. But you already have Republican critics saying, wait a second, what's going on? Is this entitlement? Is this Obamacare-lite? David Brooks, is this thing still on the rails - this replacement plan?\\n\\nBROOKS: Yeah. I mean, we have the comic prospect of people looking for the actual bill around the Capitol building this week.\\n\\nCORNISH: (Laughter) Yeah.\\n\\nBROOKS: And so like nobody - it's ludicrous they're going to mark it up next week in a couple of committees, and it's somewhere hiding in a closet somewhere. That part is ludicrous.\\n\\nCORNISH: Well, reports are it's in a dedicated reading room where people may look at it (laughter) - OK? - one at a time.\\n\\nDIONNE: A bunker (laughter).\\n\\nBROOKS: But whether they're going to actually get these tax credit plan, which I think substantively is a good plan - I just think a guy who is offering a lot of security and order is not going to pass a health care bill that would increase a lot of risk for a lot of people.\\n\\nDIONNE: People react the most when they are about to lose something. And the - a lot of people are worried that what the Republicans have in mind will take health care coverage away. And I don't think they have reassured those people yet. And that's why there's a split in the party.\\n\\nCORNISH: E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, thank you so much.\\n\\nDIONNE: Good to be with you.\\n\\nCORNISH: David Brooks of The New York Times, have a good weekend.\\n\\nBROOKS: You too.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF GORDON GOODWIN'S BIG PHAT BAND SONG, ON GREEN DOLPHIN STREET)\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "Why Did Jeb Bush Fail? There Are Many Theories\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP\\n\\nAfter disappointing finishes in presidential nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Jeb Bush suspended his campaign for president Saturday night.\\n\\nIt was the end of a run that had seemed doomed for months: countless gaffes, merciless attacks from the likes of Donald Trump, seemingly limitless spending from a superPAC he couldn't control with horrible returns from those investments and perhaps, above all, a candidate who seemed uncomfortable on the trail at best, and at worst, frustrated and unhappy.\\n\\nAlready, the post-mortems are almost writing themselves. And there are a number of theories as to why Jeb! failed in this campaign, especially after being the early favorite with all the conventional advantages. All of these theories, of course, acknowledge the effect of Donald Trump, the surprising success of his campaign and the damage his relentless attacks on Bush inflicted. But there are other reasons, as well.\\n\\nOver at FiveThirtyEight.com, Harry Enten outlined three theories of the Bush loss:\\n\\n1. Not really the choice of party leaders: Bush, initially thought to be the choice of the Republican Party establishment, was actually never the clear pick. 2. Kasich also filled the policy wonk lane: John Kasich of Ohio filled the role of policy-oriented, agreeable and sensible Republican candidate much better than Jeb Bush did. 3. Bush fatigue: Everyone underestimated it even within the party.\\n\\nThe Washington Post looked at Bush's campaign from the inside over the weekend, speaking to several former campaign operatives about what went wrong. They, too, offer three theories:\\n\\n1. Bush fatigue: Like FiveThiryEight, the Post names Bush fatigue as a big problem, but ... 2. TV's decreased influence: It also argues that the Bush campaign miscalculated the role and power of money and traditional television commercials in the 2016 race. Basically, Bush's team thought what worked 20 years ago — or even last cycle — in presidential campaigns could work today. But the rise of Trump, and his strategy of using earned and new media (just look at his Instagram) made much of those old practices obsolete. 3. Outdated campaign/message: And that leads to the third reason — running a campaign that, whether deliberate or not, was rooted in the past, managed by loyalists who admired Bush and enjoyed his confidence but who, like the candidate, found themselves in unfamiliar political terrain.\\n\\nThe article names several Bush operatives who allege the campaign had no clear strategy, no one really in control and no real way to deal with a political terrain vastly changed from the last time Bush ran for office. And they waited, the article claims, perhaps too long, to fully engage Trump.\\n\\nBut, Bush, in his loss, symbolized much more than just a failed candidate to some. At NBCNews.com, Benjy Sarlin argues that Bush's campaign suspension recognized the failure of an entire generation of the Republican Party.\\n\\nThis was a candidate who stood for an entire generation of Republican Party building, who was the figurative and literal heir to the family brand that had graced nearly every GOP ticket for a generation, Sarlin wrote.\\n\\nHe continued, And he ceded the race to a candidate whose campaign was a walking insult to his family legacy and everything Bush's supporters told themselves the party stood for.\\n\\nSarlin said Trump entered the presidential race, and re-entered the Republican Party, at a time when Tea Party momentum had taken over, spurring the rise of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\\n\\nWhen other candidates dropped out, they were easy to forget. They quickly faded away. You got to stop thinking about them.\\n\\nBut with the Bush post-mortem, there seems to be a desire to know more, to wonder what happens next or how his family accepts the news, what Barbara and George W. all have to say about it. Perhaps Matt Latimer at Politico put it best.\\n\\nI can't help but think about this coming Easter or Thanksgiving, he said, or the next event when the whole Bush family is gathered around in one place.\\n\\nKerric Harvey, editor of the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics, spoke about this before with NPR, when she noted why it has been so easy to make fun of Bush during this election.\\n\\nThe thing about Jeb is, he's actually already his own political meme, she said. He starts life as a political meme, because he comes to the digital world dragging his family behind him, his analog family story behind him. He cannot be separated from his own narrative.\\n\\nAnd that might really sum it up. The story of Jeb Bush in this election has always been about much more than just Jeb Bush. It has been about his entire family, and whether one name should have that much control over the presidency. Or whether his brother's war in Iraq was justified. Or whether his mother, Barbara, should actually run for president herself. Or whether he was Bush enough.\\n\\nJeb Bush is a character in the ongoing soap opera that is his family, but also of the Republican Party, its direction and what Republicans want.\\n\\nAnd it seemed he never got to control the plot or write the script. He was neither the hero nor the villain, but instead the character you're supposed to pity, the one always in someone else's shadow. He was a supporting actor in a show that was never really about him in the first place. And that's rarely a place where winners reside."}
{"original": "Even Before Hurricane Maria Hit, Puerto Rico Was In Financial Ruin\\n\\nNPR and PBS's FRONTLINE have investigated the devastating toll of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and how the federal response, Wall Street and a century of colonial neglect left 3.5 million Americans struggling to survive.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nIt was early morning last September 20 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In the months that followed, we've heard a lot about how the storm crippled the island, leaving millions without power, food and water. Now, over the next two days, we're going to take a deeper look at where things went wrong before and after the storm. NPR and the PBS show FRONTLINE have spent the last seven months investigating, and today they reveal a disaster that began long before Maria, a decade of Wall Street dealing that made millions for banks while the island teetered on the edge of financial collapse.\\n\\nToday NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how a once-prosperous island ended up in financial ruin, unable to prepare for the storm that was to come.\\n\\nLAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Long before Maria you probably knew Puerto Rico was in financial trouble. The story went something like this - Puerto Rico borrowed way too much money over the years, overspent that money, and now it can't pay any of it back. And then there was this other story that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their savings. But what hasn't made much sense is what one thing had to do with the other.\\n\\nIf Iowa or California borrowed money and defaulted, you wouldn't expect people living in Iowa or California to lose their money, too. And what was more unusual, Puerto Rico imploded over municipal bonds. They're supposed to be the most boring, safe financial investments out there. You buy a Puerto Rican bond, Puerto Rico pays you back later with interest.\\n\\nCATE LONG: It's bizarre, OK? It's really bizarre.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: I asked a Wall Street analyst named Cate Long what she thought of this.\\n\\nLONG: Governments don't collapse like that. And, yeah, there was hundreds of people looking at this, and nobody saw it. This is like - I mean, look at it from the outside. Yeah, this is a crazy story, man.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: It did seem crazy. Could Puerto Rico really destroy its own financial interests all by itself, or were there other players who may have had their own interests? Down in San Juan, I stop by the nonprofit Center for a New Economy to get some of the backstory. The center's policy director studies the island's finances.\\n\\nSERGIO MARXUACH: My name is Sergio Marxuach.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Say your last name again.\\n\\nMARXUACH: Marx like Karl Marx...\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Marx.\\n\\nMARXUACH: ...And swatch like the watch.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Marxuach said that for decades Puerto Rico was booming. It had the special tax break that lured pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to the island. But then in 1996, Congress began phasing it out. Within a decade, the island spun into recession and to compensate borrowed money.\\n\\nMARXUACH: The government was borrowing at an incredible clip. Some years the debt would increase by 15 percent year over year.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: How much percent?\\n\\nMARXUACH: Fifteen.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: It's easy to fault Puerto Rican politicians for this. Why didn't they just cut spending, cut school budgets and police budgets and whatever else? But you could ask every voter the same question - who do you like better, the politician who takes away all your favorite programs and gives you nothing, or the one who tells you can have everything you want and someone else will pay for it 20 years from now? Puerto Ricans chose the latter. They turned to investment banks to come in and put the bond deals together.\\n\\nMARXUACH: All they do is act as intermediaries. They find buyers.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Usually that's pension funds, your retirement account or their own clients.\\n\\nMARXUACH: That's what they get their fees for essentially. And then they're off. They are not on the hook.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: So it's not their money...\\n\\nMARXUACH: No.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: ...That's at stake here.\\n\\nMARXUACH: Yeah. So they don't care.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rico bonds had perks and in theory should have been safe. Governments rarely go broke. Yes, there was Detroit. But Puerto Rico has as many residents as almost half the states in the country. The last time a state defaulted was 1933 in Arkansas.\\n\\nMARXUACH: Fund managers, they will not admit this now, but when Puerto Rico was selling debt like pancakes, they loved Puerto Rico debt. Since they had slightly higher interest rates and no taxes attached to them, you immediately look like a genius, right? You just bump up the entire return for the entire portfolio. So that's your bonus, right? That's your new Mercedes, your new yacht.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Has anybody come forward from inside these banks to talk about what was really going on?\\n\\nMARXUACH: No. No. It's a very close-knit world in Wall Street. And the tendency is just to keep quiet and keep working.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: I went in search of that close-knit world. I found more than a dozen bankers and brokers involved in Puerto Rican bonds. They described a fast pace of moneymaking and competition and Puerto Rican politicians eager for an influx of cash. And then one afternoon, I found someone deep on the inside, a former top manager for the largest broker-dealer on the island, UBS. Carlos Capacete said he got his start in Puerto Rico's Golden Mile in the 1980s.\\n\\nCARLOS CAPACETE: All the major banks in New York would come to Puerto Rico on a regular basis to pitch deals. Listen; we can do an additional 200 million, additional 500 million. They make commissions. They make fees. This is kind of like a money-making machine. As long as there are transactions coming and going, they're making a ton of money.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he said that was all great until about 2011, when he and other bankers started realizing what many bond investors hadn't yet figured out - Puerto Rico was in trouble. There was too much debt. And this is where you might expect UBS and other banks to stop with the bond deals, stop pitching Puerto Rico bonds and stop selling Puerto Rican bonds to their clients. But the opposite happened. Capacete said when it came to clients, UBS pushed brokers to sell.\\n\\nCAPACETE: There were some hard-line tactics to sell the funds, you know, like go out and get them. Let's go. You got to sell these funds. They were just trying to push the bond funds to whoever had a heartbeat.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nSULLIVAN: There's an audio tape secretly recorded at a UBS meeting in Puerto Rico that's now part of lawsuits. You can hear a top company manager telling brokers to sell the bonds or...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go home. Get a new job.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: These bonds were specifically designed to sell to Puerto Ricans. They were part of special bond funds that were far riskier than what regulators allow on the mainland. Brokers sold tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans into these special funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the island's wealth was now highly concentrated at the worst possible time. And then Capacete heard a troubling story.\\n\\nCAPACETE: One day this client tells me, are you aware of what they're doing in this other branch? And I said, tell me. And he told me the scheme.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he says he learned some brokers were pushing Puerto Rican clients who had already put so much of their retirement or savings into the special funds to go borrow money and put it into the funds, too. It's like using poker chips to take out a loan for more poker chips and betting them all on the same hand.\\n\\nCAPACETE: It's unethical. It's against the bank's regulations. And it puts the clients in a really, really tough risk situation.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Capacete sent emails warning UBS. Almost a year later, two officers from the bank's compliance office came and said they found no evidence of the practice.\\n\\nCAPACETE: And I jumped up and I said, you're kidding, right? This is a joke. And I told her, look at the big accounts and follow the money. I left the room, and I don't think I ever spoke to them again.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Why do you think the bank would want to turn a blind eye to something like this?\\n\\nCAPACETE: Because it was profitable. And I was the one that was - in Spanish we say (speaking Spanish). I was the one that was spoiling their party.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: UBS declined NPR and FRONTLINE's requests for an interview but said its loan terms were fully disclosed, and that the program as a whole did not violate financial regulations. It pointed to a separate case where regulators found it didn't mislead clients and called Capacete a disgruntled former employee who has sued the bank, and said it fired the one employee who had been violating policies.\\n\\nEventually, federal regulators investigated and found the bank should have had a system in place to prevent the practice. They fined UBS $34 million for the loan scheme and other problems. They also fined UBS and four other banks for putting clients at risk in the special funds. Eighteen hundred UBS customers have now sued.\\n\\nBut in 2013, the party came to an end for investors. Bond prices tanked. All of those tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans tied up in the same risky funds were in serious trouble, and those that had taken out additional loans suddenly had to cover them. Within months, billions of dollars of Puerto Rican wealth was wiped out.\\n\\nAnd surely by now the government and banks would want to be done with this Puerto Rican bond business. Rating agencies downgraded Puerto Rican bonds to junk. I asked Puerto Rico's current governor, Ricardo Rossello, what he thought of this period, and he put it this way.\\n\\nRICARDO ROSSELLO: The governor of Puerto Rico was run as a big Ponzi scheme. What you had was essentially a black box of a government running that had no clarity as to what was being borrowed and what was being spent.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: But in 2014, cable news was ablaze. The banks in Puerto Rico were going in for another bond deal.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Demand for Puerto Rico's debt was through the roof.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: It was the largest municipal junk bond offering in U.S. history.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This deal I believe is a $3 1/2 billion deal. So we're up...\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rican officials for their part told me they needed the cash to make payroll. But when I went back to the bankers I had met, several of whom had worked on the deal, they told me something else. They said this bond was more than just a bond deal. They said it was also an exit strategy for the banks. See; in the years before the bond, the banks had been loaning Puerto Rico money or making investments in other ways. Government documents show hundreds of millions of dollars were now at stake on an island in financial trouble.\\n\\nAnd dig deep into the 2014 bond documents, and you'll see it, too. Almost a quarter of the entire bond goes to pay them back, almost $900 million that didn't go to Puerto Ricans or even to keep the government afloat but went to pay back loans, pay fees or eliminate other risk of banks directly involved in putting the deal together. Barclays, which led the bond deal, got almost half a billion dollars; Banco Santander, 100 million; JPMorgan, 74 million; Morgan Stanley, 24 million; and others.\\n\\nNeither Barclays nor any of the other banks would agree to an interview. In statements, banks said they fully disclosed their financial stake in the deal and did not influence how Puerto Rico used the money. Morgan Stanley said they also extended Puerto Rico $250 million in credit after the bond. It was difficult to find bank insiders to talk on the record about this. And then I found one former broker who would.\\n\\nAXEL RIVERA: I started back in 1983 in Wall Street.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: I met Axel Rivera in a hotel lobby in San Juan. He was at Morgan Stanley when the record 2014 deal was done. As he flipped through the bond, he said when the island got closer to default, banks were getting nervous. They had too much debt on the island.\\n\\nRIVERA: They wanted to try to get as much as they could of their exposure out of their books.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Your colleagues at Morgan Stanley...\\n\\nRIVERA: Yes.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: ...Told you...\\n\\nRIVERA: Yes.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: ...That they had exposure to risk at that time.\\n\\nRIVERA: That they had much more than what they wanted, and they needed to unwind that.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: And they needed the 2014 bond...\\n\\nRIVERA: That's correct.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: ...To get them out. Then who gets left paying the bill?\\n\\nRIVERA: The bondholders, whomever they are. The banks get out, and everybody else gets - they get stuck with the bill.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Rivera said for banks like Morgan Stanley and others, the bond was the finale, capping years of profit with a way out.\\n\\nRIVERA: Most of the general public didn't understand what was going on. The darkness of this bond deal made a lot of people in Wall Street happy, but it was immoral in many ways.\\n\\nSULLIVAN: Fifteen months later, the then-governor announced the island couldn't pay any of its debt. It was broke. The bond funds crashed, savings, retirements, pensions gone. The government started closing hospitals. There was no money to shore up bridges or electrical grids. And then - well, you know what happened next. A Category 4 hurricane came barreling into Puerto Rico. If ever this island needed the federal government to come and bring its A-game, now was the time. What it got was anything but.

{"original": "Flight Overbooked? Perfect: These Frequent Flyers Want To Get Bumped\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Goldman/AP David Goldman/AP\\n\\nUnited Airlines is increasing the amount it will pay passengers who get bumped from overbooked flights to as much as $10,000. That announcement comes after its CEO, Oscar Munoz, called a now-infamous video showing police violently dragging a seated passenger off a full flight earlier this month horrifying.\\n\\nWhen we read that story, our reaction was, 'Dang, I wish we'd been on that flight,'  says Fay Fishman, a veteran traveler with a love of getting bumped off overbooked flights.\\n\\nFishman is among a select group of travelers who spend considerable effort trying to get bumped from overbooked flights; they are, in fact, overjoyed to give up their seats in exchange for travel vouchers or cash the airlines give out as compensation.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Fay Fishman\\n\\nFishman is what I would call a serious player of The Bump Game. She and her husband are law partners who split their life and work between Phoenix and Minneapolis, flying at least once a week, not including leisure travel.\\n\\nWe seem to live on airplanes and we love it, Fishman says. They even love hanging out for hours, getting work done at the airport lounge or having a drink at a restaurant.\\n\\nBut gunning for bumps is also a serious effort. Fishman sets their schedule six months to a year in advance, aiming to travel at the busiest times.\\n\\nOn a Monday school holiday, a Thursday or Friday before that is a great bump possibility, she says. You know, it also helps when you don't have young kids [her husband has two grown children], you don't have pets and you don't have green plants, so you have nothing that needs your care and attention.\\n\\nFishman says they arrive at the airport at least an hour before their flights, and aim to be the first to speak to the gate agents — some of whom already know her — to enthusiastically volunteer. She even keeps Starbucks gift cards to give to the gate agents as thank you gifts if they do get bumped.\\n\\nFishman says she and her husband once scored $3,200 on a single trip. Using these rewards, the couple has traveled to the Middle East, Asia and all around Europe.\\n\\nThe winnings can depend on the timing of the alternate flight, or the airline's own policy. Regulations allow up to $1,350 for bumping a passenger from a domestic flight; Delta recently authorized supervisors to offer up to $9,950, and now United has followed suit.\\n\\nBrian Karimzad, who sometimes plays the game himself, says knock-on airline backups from bad weather can add up to big money.\\n\\nYou get bumped off one flight, and then that flight ends up getting overbooked and you get on another one that's overbooked, and you could end up with thousands of dollars in compensation, he says.\\n\\nKarimzad is director of MileCards.com, a travel rewards site that recently ranked Delta as the carrier likeliest to pay to bump passengers. Other pro tips? Airlines prefer volunteers without checked baggage. Also, smaller regional planes are 50 percent likelier to bump.\\n\\nThe game favors students or people who can work remotely — not those scheduled for big meetings, weddings or funerals.\\n\\nThe most important thing is you have to have a lot of time, says Brian Sumers, airline reporter for travel website Skift. And, he says, if you play, know you're up against some seasoned competition.\\n\\nThere's a small but vocal minority that tries to come up with ways to beat airlines at their own game, Sumers says.\\n\\nAnthropology professor Montana Miller commutes weekly to Bowling Green State University in Ohio from her home in Long Island, N.Y. Her annual airline bill tops $20,000, so she loves vouchers.\\n\\nFree money! she says. It's like a jackpot; it's like winning the lottery a little bit. ... It's unexpected money that just helps me out with my financial stress. To her, waiting another several hours at the gate is bliss: I'm an anthropologist, so I really enjoy the airport environment; I enjoy the human drama that takes place there.\\n\\nThe downside, she says, is the fact that she wins a voucher about 5 percent of the time. Most of the time I get my heart broken.\\n\\nIn fact, airlines bump passengers about 40 percent less frequently than they did about two decades ago, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\\n\\nBecause her odds are low, Miller says she has never asked for more than the typical $400 voucher. That, too, is part of her strategy. The problem with saying, 'I'm going to hold out,' is that there's going to be someone else who's happy to take less money.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Todd Gladfelter Courtesy of Todd Gladfelter\\n\\nThen there are Bump Game champions like Todd Gladfelter, a San Francisco meteorologist. From around the year 2000 to about 2006, I didn't pay for a single airline ticket out of pocket, he says.\\n\\nThat's an achievement, when you consider he travels, on average, every week. He says it pays to do research before talking to the gate agent.\\n\\nWhen you come up and say, 'Hey, here's an alternative flight that I have,' they'll be very appreciative of that, and might even choose you over another passenger because you came up prepared, he explains.\\n\\nBreaking the news that he's won a voucher, once again, to his waiting parents can be another matter.\\n\\nOh, I'm going to be on a later flight, Gladfelter tells them. Initially, they were disappointed, but now they're used to it, and they know he'll use the funds to come visit again."}
{"original": "Trump Will Skip GOP Debate As Feud With Fox News Boils Over\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP\\n\\nThis post was updated Wednesday at 8:45 a.m. ET\\n\\nThe stage is set for Thursday's Fox News Channel final debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses — but front-runner Donald Trump won't be there.\\n\\nAfter teasing earlier Tuesday evening that he probably won't bother with the debate, Trump's campaign confirmed he won't participate, citing unfair treatment from the network:\\n\\nAs someone who wrote one of the best-selling business books of all time, The Art of the Deal, who has built an incredible company, including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world, and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars, Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one. FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn't play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity.\\n\\nTrump's objections stem from last year's first GOP presidential debate, when anchor and moderator Megyn Kelly pressed him about his derogatory comments about women. Trump was outraged, and later said on CNN that Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever with her angry questioning.\\n\\nOn Tuesday evening, Trump doubled down when speaking to reporters in Iowa, dismissing Kelly as a third-rate reporter who is frankly not good at what she does.\\n\\nFox News hasn't backed down on picking Kelly again as one of its moderators, alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. And earlier Tuesday, the network slammed Trump for trying to bully it into changing the moderators.\\n\\nWe learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings, a Fox News spokesman said in a statement.\\n\\nThat tongue-in-cheek statement seemed to push Trump to follow through on his threat to not participate in the debate.\\n\\nIn lieu of attending the debate, Trump's campaign said he would instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.\\n\\nFox News shot back in a statement late Tuesday evening, saying it was the Trump campaign who had threatened Kelly.\\n\\nWe're not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage, a Fox News spokesperson said. Capitulating to politicians' ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly. In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a 'rough couple of days after that last debate' and he 'would hate to have her go through that again.' Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so. We can't give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees. Trump is still welcome at Thursday night's debate and will be treated fairly, just as he has been during his 132 appearances on FOX News & FOX Business, but he can't dictate the moderators or the questions.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Trump posted an Instagram video, calling Kelly biased. On Twitter, he asked followers to vote on whether he should debate.\\n\\nShould I do the #GOPdebate? A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Jan 26, 2016 at 10:04am PST\\n\\nHis absence would change the balance of the debate and give his rivals free shots to attack Trump.\\n\\nWith Trump off the stage for the 9 p.m. ET debate, that means it's Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who will be center stage, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who was kept off the main stage at the last debate.\\n\\nAt 7 p.m. ET, the earlier undercard debate will feature former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore — who hasn't been on a debate stage since August.\\n\\nCruz issued his own debate challenge to his main Iowa rival — a 90-minute one-on-one debate next Monday, the day of the Iowa caucuses.\\n\\nGive the Republican primary voters the right to see a fair and policy-focused debate, not simply insults, Cruz said on the Mark Levin radio show, according to Politico."}
{"original": "How A Memphis Food Hall Is Transforming Refugee Lives And The Community\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Global Café Global Café\\n\\nSeven years ago, Nepal native Indra Sunuwar, now 23, arrived in Memphis, Tenn., with her mom, dad and four siblings. They were seeking an opportunity for a better life. I was really surprised by the cars and buildings and everything, she says. I'd never seen a city like this before.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer family was resettled in Memphis by Catholic Charities of West Tennessee, which showed them how to do things like buy groceries and take a bus. For the first few years, the transition wasn't that smooth for Sunuwar, who struggled to connect with her peers at school. I made a lot of friends from other different countries, like Somalia, and I get along easy with them because they're like me, she says. But I didn't really get close with American students. I don't know why; it was just uncomfortable.\\n\\nAfter graduating from high school, Sunuwar was working at the commercial Kaleidoscope Kitchen with a fellow refugee named Ibti Salih, from Sudan, when they met Sabine Langer. They didn't know it right away, but Langer would soon change the course of their lives through a food hall she would launch called Global Café.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Global Café Global Café\\n\\nLanger herself is an immigrant. She was born in Switzerland and came to the United States when she was 21, finally settling in Memphis in 2012. She was volunteering with the Refugee Empowerment Program — an initiative that provides resources like after-school programs — in Memphis' Binghampton neighborhood when she began to think about how fresh, local food could make a difference in the community at large, and that there were immigrants who were willing and able to help.\\n\\nI met these amazing women from different countries who were cooking on the side as a hobby or a way to make extra income, says Langer. Some of them were dreaming about owning a restaurant but were not in a financial position to do that.\\n\\nSo she formulated an idea for an international food hall that would bring together cuisines from around the world, providing job opportunities for refugees and supplying Binghampton with healthy food sources. Denver's Avanti Food & Beverage, which features seven eclectic restaurant concepts under one roof, was one source of inspiration for Global Café, which Langer opened in August.\\n\\nOpen for lunch and dinner, Global Café is located inside Crosstown Concourse, a one-million-square-foot vertical urban village occupying the historic Sears building, which until recently, sat empty for 20 years. Crosstown Concourse now includes food establishments, art galleries and artists' residences, wellness facilities, retail shops, a charter high school, a theater, and a brewery.\\n\\nGuests come to Global Café to try authentic, affordable dishes prepared by refugee food entrepreneurs from three different countries. Yet Global Café also serves as a gathering place, helping members of the community break bread together while learning about other cultures.\\n\\nThis Southern city near the Mississippi border seems like an unlikely place for such a concept. Yet the area is surprisingly diverse: In 2016, there were more than 70,300 immigrants living in Memphis — about 11 percent of the total population, according to a compilation of data from New American Economy, a bipartisan research and advocacy firm focused on immigration policy. Memphis is also home to one of 20 World Relief offices in the U.S., which partner with churches and communities to provide transition programs for refugees and immigrants.\\n\\nThe area's diversity is projected to grow. Between 2010 and 2015, the overall population of Memphis grew 2.2 percent, while the immigrant population increased 2.7 percent. The trend mirrors one the entire country is experiencing, with U.S. foreign-born population reaching its highest level since 1910 (13.7 percent in 2017, up from 13.5 percent in 2016), according to U.S. Census data.\\n\\nEven armed with these statistics, Langer — who's vegan, doesn't cook and has no culinary background — took a big gamble getting into the restaurant business. Yet she saw a need.\\n\\nI eat a lot of ethnic food, and often found myself in hole-in-the-wall places in not-so-great neighborhoods, says Langer. I thought, what if we could create a place for an Average Joe who would love to try something else, but hasn't had the courage to go to a neighborhood that's a little more salty [to get it]?\\n\\nShe asked both Sunuwar and Salih to come on board, inviting them to have their own cooking stalls in Global Café, where they could prepare beloved dishes from their home countries and serve them to the local community while sharing a bit about their culture, too. The open floor plan of the café makes it possible for customers to speak with the chef every time they order, as long as it's not too busy.\\n\\nFayha Sakkan, who fled Syria with her husband in 1992 and helps other refugee families get settled in Memphis, was the third chef Langer asked to be part of Global Café. Sakkan had worked as a nanny for over two decades and was doing catering on the side when she learned of the opportunity.\\n\\nI could cook for 24 hours, I don't mind. I love to cook, she says.\\n\\nIndeed, Sakkan's chicken kababs and tabouleh have already become something of legend at Global Café in just a few months.\\n\\nThe other chefs have experienced similar success: Sunuwar's momo (Nepalase dumplings) and samosas, which she makes fresh to order, sell like hotcakes. One frequent customer comes in almost daily for vegetarian chow mein, often asking her about Nepal and when she's going to open her own restaurant.\\n\\nIt means a lot to me, says Sunuwar. Cooking is like, the way you get connected with people, or how you can prove yourself or learn about different countries.\\n\\nBut their journey hasn't been easy. While each of them talks about how well their food has been received, and how the community around Global Café has been welcoming, Langer says the assimilation process is arduous.\\n\\nRefugees often get settled in a country with no advance notice, she says, so they don't have time to learn the language or the customs. Typically they get the first job they can get that doesn't require English or skills, and end up in a warehouse job. Many of them are highly educated — like Salih from Sudan, who has degrees in psychology and philosophy — but their paperwork doesn't translate, or they don't have paperwork due to an emergency situation.\\n\\nIt's kind of a cycle; they work hard, and don't have time to take English lessons because they're busy trying to survive, says Langer. You could be in country for decades and not really learn the language, and sometimes that brings up comments from people that they're not working toward integration.\\n\\nNow a dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States, Langer knows the struggles first hand. My process was pretty difficult from a rich country, she says, but being a refugee is a million times harder than being an immigrant.\\n\\nThat's a big reason she tries to employ as many refugees and immigrants as possible. Global Café's general manager is from Mexico, and the chefs each have assistants from their home countries.\\n\\nThis idea of spreading refugee cuisine is taking off in other cities around the country, too. West Side Bazaar, in Buffalo, N.Y., functions as a small-business incubator for immigrants and refugees, with nine restaurants helmed by refugee or immigrant chefs, ranging from Asian Halal to Ethiopian cuisine. There's been talk of turning Seattle's King Street Station into an immigrant food hall similar to Global Café. And organizations like Komeeda, a New York-based company that puts on food events, launched a series called Chefugee Cuisine, meant to help refugee chefs share their native cuisine.\\n\\nBite by bite, it appears to be making a difference.\\n\\nA Memphis taxi driver from Somalia visits Saliih's stall at Global Café every day because the food reminds him of dishes his grandmother used to make back home. Sometimes he even brings one of his customers with him. If they're in doubt at first, Salih's famous falafel — which she says once brought a guest to tears — soon changes their mind.\\n\\nWhat they don't realize is that the reward goes both ways. I miss my country a lot, but when I cook, and share my stories and my food with the people, it gives me a really good feeling about my culture, says Salih. I always just say just try it. I give you a bit of my heart, a bit of my love."}
{"original": "Louisiana Tries New Defense Against Floods — Move People To Higher Ground\\n\\nLouisiana has announced a big policy shift. Rather than buying people out after a natural disaster, the state wants to move them out of harm's way ahead of one.\\n\\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nNow we're going to turn to Louisiana. It's on low ground, and residents there have long built flood barriers to stay safe. But that's no longer enough. Now state officials have mapped out areas that will have to be let go. The problem is that more than 2,000 families live on that land that can no longer be protected. As Ryan Kailath of member station WWNO reports, authorities have made a striking recommendation to deal with this.\\n\\nRYAN KAILATH, BYLINE: Al Yates and Anthony Caronia live just north of New Orleans in St. Tammany Parish. They've been neighbors for 30 years. Last week, the two friends stood outside marveling at a huge flock of purple martins.\\n\\nAL YATES: I don't know why they came here so early. They're supposed to come in May.\\n\\nANTHONY CARONIA: And then you've got the alligators already showing up, and then you see the fish striking.\\n\\nKAILATH: Yeah.\\n\\nCARONIA: We go by the birds and the trees and the...\\n\\nKAILATH: Right.\\n\\nCARONIA: ...Flowers out here.\\n\\nKAILATH: These guys love the warm weather, but it makes them nervous that nature feels out of whack. To them, a mild winter signals a hot, stormy summer. And in this neighborhood...\\n\\nCARONIA: Anytime you hear a storm's even getting anywhere close to Florida into the Gulf of Mexico, you get ready.\\n\\nKAILATH: Caronia says he evacuates his family about four times a year - shuts down his towing company, pulls his son out of school.\\n\\nCARONIA: The hardest part is getting your family a place to stay. You might have to go five hours out till this passes.\\n\\nKAILATH: Caronia didn't set out to live in one of the most disaster-prone parts of the state. When his parents first got here, the area was pretty well-protected. But decades of storms, rising seas and sinking land have changed all that. The state is now recommending his area for voluntary home buyouts. The plan is to move people out of harm's way, knock the houses down and turn the land itself into a natural storm barrier. There's no cash offer on the table yet, but if there were...\\n\\nCARONIA: Gone. I'm gone. I'm leaving. Mr. Alvin, too - he's selling. Anybody you talk back here, they're afraid now. It's scary, sir.\\n\\nBREN HAASE: This is the most aggressive step that Louisiana has taken to implement these sort of programs and to take a sort of an alternative look at how we might reduce risk.\\n\\nKAILATH: Bren Haase is chief of planning for the state's coastal authority. Reduced risk, he says, that's what levees and floodgates do. But move to higher ground and you can leave a lot of that risk behind. Public policy types have a name for this. They call it retreat.\\n\\nHas that word come up before?\\n\\nPAT BRISTER: I don't use it (laughter).\\n\\nKAILATH: Pat Brister is president of the St. Tammany Parish where more than a third of these buyouts are recommended, more than anywhere else. The idea of retreat does not sit well with her.\\n\\nBRISTER: These are not just homes. I know the people that live in these homes, and I know they've lived there for some generations. So it's not as simple as just buy the home out. It's lives that we're talking about. So it's not easy.\\n\\nKAILATH: Retreating would hurt the local economy, too. If people leave, their property taxes go with them. Brister would rather keep people in their homes by building new flood barriers. The state's new plan does call for that, but there's not enough money budgeted yet. And even if there were, it would take 30 years to finish building something strong enough to keep Caronia and his neighbors dry. He says he doesn't have that kind of time.\\n\\nCARONIA: It's time to let us go. We're in our 50s and 60s and 70s back here. We're tired.\\n\\nKAILATH: Tired of storms, tired of flooding, tired of waiting. To him, retreat doesn't sound like such a bad plan.\\n\\nFor NPR News, I'm Ryan Kailath.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARTURO STALTERI'S SELIKA SUITE, V MOVIMENTO)\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "Reexamining Mike Pence's Record On Health Care As Indiana Governor\\n\\nVice President Pence is now in charge of U.S. coronavirus response, prompting a look back at his health record as Indiana governor facing an HIV outbreak, a drug epidemic and Medicaid expansion.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump has put his No. 2 in charge of the U.S. response to the new coronavirus.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me. But he's got a certain talent for this.\\n\\nKELLY: It is true that Vice President Mike Pence has dealt with public health crises before. When he was governor of Indiana, five years ago, his state faced an outbreak of a different kind - a cluster of HIV cases linked to the opioid epidemic. Jake Harper is an investigative health reporter with WFYI in Indianapolis. He covered that outbreak. He joins me now.\\n\\nJake Harper, welcome.\\n\\nJAKE HARPER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nKELLY: So take me back to 2015. What exactly happened? How did this HIV outbreak begin?\\n\\nHARPER: So in early 2015, the state announced that people in Austin, Ind., were contracting HIV. Austin's a small rural town sort of near the Kentucky border. It has little more than 4,000 people, but that outbreak eventually grew to more than 200 who were infected with HIV. The virus was spreading through injection drug use. People were taking this painkiller, injecting it. At the same time, they were sharing their needles and spreading HIV.\\n\\nSo back when this was happening, I went to Austin. And I met a man named Kevin Polly. And he told me that the very same day he found out he was infected with HIV, another woman asked to share his needle.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nKEVIN POLLY: She said, Kevin, I've got a problem. She said, I've got this pill but no needle. She said, can I use yours? And honey, I just tested positive for HIV. Well, we've used before; you know, it don't matter. Oh, my God, honey, it does matter. Before, I didn't know I was sick. I let her use my needle - the last one. Should have never happened.\\n\\nKELLY: It did happen. They weren't the only ones. And it became this crisis to which then-Governor Mike Pence responded how?\\n\\nHARPER: Critics would say that Governor Pence responded too slowly. Many people were calling for Indiana to legalize syringe exchange programs, where someone who uses drugs can bring their used needles and get clean ones. Other states allow this, and they help prevent infections. But Pence was really resistant to that idea for a while. Here he is back in 2015.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I don't believe that effective anti-drug policy involves handing out paraphernalia to drug users by government officials. I reject that.\\n\\nHARPER: Pence actually took another month to think about it after the state announced the outbreak, and then he reluctantly authorized a needle exchange in Scott County.\\n\\nKELLY: One other thing about his record - which is that Pence is an evangelical Christian. Bernie Sanders - Senator Sanders, who's running for the Democratic presidential nominee, he was tweeting Trump's plan to deal with all this is to have Pence, quote, who wanted to pray away HIV epidemic oversee the response.\\n\\nFact-check that for us. Did Mike Pence try to pray away HIV?\\n\\nHARPER: I don't think so. I think the quote from him was that he was going to go home and pray on the decision of whether to authorize a needle exchange. He ended up authorizing the exchange, but I don't get the sense from reading that quote that he was trying to pray away the problem of HIV.\\n\\nKELLY: OK. Questions also being raised today about the wisdom of putting Pence in charge with coronavirus because of his role in slashing the public health budget in Indiana when he was governor, which prompts me to ask - did Mike Pence, as governor, do anything that public health officials liked?\\n\\nHARPER: Sure. So Pence, as a Republican, under Obamacare, did expand Medicaid. He did it with restrictions. So people who need insurance, many of them need to pay a premium in order to get coverage, and they face getting kicked off or getting bumped down to a lower level of coverage if they don't pay. But that program did bring health insurance to a lot of people who didn't have it before, and that helps with public health issues like addiction.\\n\\nKELLY: But bottom line - how relevant is Mike Pence's experience as governor dealing with health issues in Indiana to his ability to handle the coronavirus in 2020?\\n\\nHARPER: Well, it's Pence and his entire health team seem to have gone with him to D.C. So Seema Verma, who is now the head of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is often referred to as the architect of Indiana's Medicaid program. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar used to be the head of Eli Lilly, which is based in Indianapolis. And U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who just joined the White House coronavirus task force, was the state health commissioner here for years.\\n\\nKELLY: Wow. It's the whole Indiana team - upped stakes and moved to D.C.\\n\\nHARPER: Yep.\\n\\nKELLY: Jake Harper, he's a reporter with WFYI and a co-host of the podcast Sick.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nHARPER: You bet.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

The U.N. expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to $29 billion.\\n\\nHot spots include Burkina Faso, where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people; the Philippines, where a Christmas Eve typhoon killed more than two dozen; and Venezuela, where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years.\\n\\nShannon Scribner, associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at Oxfam America, says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need, and that will continue to be a challenge.\\n\\nScribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international NGOs that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict-affected areas such as Syria and Yemen.\\n\\nHumanitarian law isn't being upheld in some of the countries where we're working, says Scribner. And we don't see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did.\\n\\nOne key solution, she says: Channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately, rather than big international NGOs. — Tim McDonnell\\n\\nSecond-tier diseases will go gangbusters\\n\\nOver the last 12 months, the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers — HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. But other illnesses, some of them easily preventable, stole the limelight.\\n\\nThose second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. In a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including China, Angola and the Philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. Venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. Despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the Middle East, and that will probably continue in the coming year.\\n\\nRecent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.\\n\\nBut there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien\\n\\nAid will become even more political\\n\\nIt seems we're returning to the bad old days of the Cold War when we used aid as a glorified payoff for [political] friends and allies, says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and former U.S. foreign disaster assistance chief under the Obama administration.\\n\\nInstead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.\\n\\nThe U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid. These shifts by the U.S. and U.K., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says Konyndyk. — Joanne Lu\\n\\nUnrest over inequality will grow\\n\\n2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.\\n\\nSince the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different, he says, meaning inequality will deepen, despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it.\\n\\nPart of the problem is that inequality has a new face, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme. People are no longer just angry about income; they're concerned about inequalities in political representation and power, higher education, access to technology and the resources to survive climate change.\\n\\nChancel says the protests in Chile, France, Lebanon, Hong Kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions. Until they do, the UNDP report warns, the social unrest will likely continue. — Joanne Lu\\n\\nWater taps continue to run dry\\n\\nIn June 2019, Chennai, India, reached Day Zero — the day on which the city's reservoirs ran almost completely out of water. By the fall, seasonal rains had resupplied the city, at least temporarily. But the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020.\\n\\nIn India alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. And an August report from the World Resources Institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including Botswana, India, Iran and Mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.\\n\\nUpmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center, says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity, in many cases Day Zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources.\\n\\nI haven't seen any reasonable improvement, he says. So I think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a Day Zero this year.\\n\\nThe Indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. But on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for El Niño and La Niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others. The absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity.\\n\\nEither way, Victoria Beard, an urban planning professor at Cornell University and World Resources Institute fellow, says water scarcity will continue to be a problem, especially in cities, until governments of high-risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems.\\n\\nPeople are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services, she says. There's no self-provision [of bottled water] that's going to solve this problem in the long term. There are no examples where it's a free-for-all and it works out well. You need coordinated massive public investment. — Tim McDonnell\\n\\nGender equality is not on the horizon\\n\\nThe U.N. calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world. Yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality, as defined by the U.N.'s sustainable development goals, by 2030.\\n\\n2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality: It's the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights. The global community will be taking stock of progress — and lack thereof — at gatherings such as that of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in March.\\n\\nWorldwide, women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence, less access to economic and educational opportunities, and exclusion from decision-making roles at the community and governmental levels.\\n\\nBy one measure, the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century. The most current estimate by the World Economic Forum — which publishes an annual report to track country-by-country progress across economic, educational, health and political dimensions — is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99.5 years at the current rate.\\n\\nWhile the WEF report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment, which could be possible in as soon as 12 years, progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding. By that metric, parity is a lowly 57.8% and will take 257 years to overcome. — Emily Vaughn\\n\\nHopeful trends\\n\\nGlobal health will get woke\\n\\nThis year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. People who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.\\n\\nOne reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. In the colonial era, European researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.\\n\\nOver the past couple of years, he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change. They aim to give medical professionals in low-income countries real leadership roles. At the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. And communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. Many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #ShiftThePower and #DecolonizeGlobalHealth.\\n\\nJennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.\\n\\nThere's a real question as to how to flip the leadership, says Lentfer. And that's coming to a big head. — Malaka Gharib\\n\\nSatellite imagery could improve global health\\n\\nThis year, expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky-high point of view. Imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive — and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty, disease and environmental challenges.\\n\\nMarshall Burke, deputy director of Stanford University's Center on Food Security and the Environment, is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them.\\n\\nLet's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. Satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, Burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.\\n\\nSatellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the Sahel look for water and assisting regulators in West Africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining. It can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters. In some cases, it might help us peer into the future: In December, the World Resources Institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery, in conjunction with other data, to predict water shortages and conflicts.\\n\\nIn 2020, Burke says, expect to see more satellite-based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers. And although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the U.S. and the European Union, more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries — including Ethiopia's first observatory satellite, launched in late December. — Tim McDonnell\\n\\nYouth activists will lead the fight for a better world\\n\\nIt's not just Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who seized Time's Person of the Year cover for 2019. Helena Gualinga, a teen Indigenous activist from the Ecuadorian Amazon, took world leaders to task at the COP 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights. University students in India are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants.\\n\\nYoung people are in the lead, said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres in a statement on Human Rights Day. Everywhere, they are marching against corruption, repression and inequality, and for human rights and human dignity.\\n\\nIn 2020, youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see, says Jessica Taft, a youth-movement researcher and professor of Latin American studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\\n\\nThat kind of involvement by young people isn't new, Taft says. But what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other. With their phones set to retweet, they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away.\\n\\nA common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make.\\n\\nMany of the issues that they're focusing on right now are ones that they're able to claim moral authority around as young people, says Taft. That includes topics such as climate change and gun violence, which young people can address from personal experience, like the students at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who captured the world's attention after the shooting at their school.\\n\\nMatt Deitsch, a graduate of the school and an organizer of the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., told NPR in an interview in 2019: If we're not standing up and organizing ourselves, then we're not doing enough to save lives in America. — Pien Huang\\n\\nCash will be king (of aid)\\n\\nIt's an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades: Instead of giving poor people goods and services — say, a cow or job training — why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it?\\n\\nInterest in cash transfers — as this form of aid is often referred to — is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade, says David Evans, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Global Development.\\n\\nOne reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long-term effects of some of the earliest large-scale cash transfer programs — a series of government assistance schemes that began in Latin America in the late 1990s. Already we're starting to see the first wave of long-term evaluations, says Evans, who is on leave as a lead economist at the World Bank.\\n\\nSo far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — Nurith Aizenman\\n\\nAccess to college will boom\\n\\nMore and more people are going to college. Access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years, says Michael Green, CEO of Social Progress Imperative, and he expects it to continue in 2020.\\n\\nGreen and his organization, through its Social Progress Index, have been tracking this every year since 2014. Higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries, says Green, but many countries are making significant leaps, both in terms of enrollment and quality, and it's leading to a growing global middle class. Some of the biggest improvers, according to their data, include Morocco, Slovakia and Turkey.\\n\\nOur World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. Although the improvement isn't in every country, Green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — Joanne Lu"}

The winners are American consumers. We all get cheaper goods from abroad. American companies benefit too; they sell more products overseas, even hire extra workers. But there are also people who lose, and those people tend to lose big and lose in big groups. In parts of the country, factories have been closing and jobs have been moving overseas for decades.\\n\\nSo to make trade really benefit everyone, there's this idea that makes a lot of sense. Take some of the money, some of the gains, from the people who are better off because of trade and give it to the losers. This isn't just a theoretical idea. It's an entire government program.\\n\\nSince 1974, the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program has been helping workers who have lost their jobs due to trade policy. TAA is sometimes called the Cadillac of retraining programs. In one sense, workers who lose their jobs to trade are in a far better position than workers who lose their jobs to pretty much anything else: recession, bad management, whatever. Because if they lose their jobs to trade they can qualify for TAA and that means the government will help them find a job in an industry that isn't dying. TAA will pay for school, relocation and job-seeking expenses, pretty much whatever it takes to help a former factory worker find a new job that won't be outsourced.\\n\\nSo why don't we hear more about this program? Why does it seem like there's nothing left behind for workers after a factory closes up because of trade?\\n\\nOn today's show, we visit one of the cities where trade has had a big impact: Erie, Pennsylvania. When General Electric downsized a locomotive factory in Erie, 1,500 people lost their jobs. Many of them were eligible for TAA benefits. Things aren't going so smoothly, though. We try to find out why.\\n\\n\\n\\nMusic: The Long Haul and Happy Faces. Find us: Twitter/ Facebook."}
{"original": "Missing: The Search For A Sister In China\\n\\nEnlarge this image Isabel Seliger for NPR Isabel Seliger for NPR\\n\\nLast summer, a Chinese-American woman and NPR listener reached out with an unusual request. She asked me to help find her sister, who'd vanished in the mountains of Yunnan province in southwest China.\\n\\nMy little sister has been missing since Nov. 23, 2013, the woman wrote in an email. She married a farmer in a remote village and was abused by her husband shortly after her marriage. She escaped from him after a few abuses.\\n\\nThen, her little sister disappeared. Her account on WeChat, China's most popular social media app, went dark, along with her cellphones. Police had initially investigated but seemed to have lost interest in the case.\\n\\nThe big sister, who works in IT in the American Midwest, had heard a radio series in which I drive a free cab around Shanghai, giving people rides as a way to learn about the lives of ordinary Chinese.\\n\\nBy reading and listening to your reports, the woman wrote, I know you can help me.\\n\\nPeople disappear in China all the time. Boys are kidnapped and sold to couples who want sons. Back in the 1990s, I traveled with a private detective who rescued women who'd been sold to farmers as wives. There's even a popular TV show devoted to helping people find their missing loved ones, called Dengzhewo, which means waiting for me in Mandarin.\\n\\nThis particular case, though, stood out. It offered an intimate way to understand some of the country's dramatic changes through the lives of two sisters — one Chinese, the other Chinese-American — who'd taken very different paths.\\n\\nTo protect their privacy, and because our investigation unearthed sensitive personal details, NPR is not naming the women or other characters in this story.\\n\\nMy assistant, Yang Zhuo, and I met the big sister at an airport in Yunnan last fall. Her journey back to China was not only a quest to find her little sister but also an attempt to do her duty, according to Chinese family tradition, as the first-born sibling. Her mother had passed away, and her father was a simple farmer who lacked the skills to mount an investigation.\\n\\nWe set out in an SUV, driving through lush valleys carved by muddy rivers. After a couple of hours, we hit a military checkpoint. A soldier in body armor with an automatic rifle asked for our IDs and where we were heading. It was a reminder that we were traveling in a distant, dicier part of China near the border with Myanmar and Laos. The region just south of here is known as the Golden Triangle, and it's notorious for heroin smuggling and human trafficking.\\n\\nA Troubled History\\n\\nAs we continued into the mountains, Big Sister filled us in on her family's history. The girls had grown up with three other siblings on a farm in Heilongjiang province, in China's far northeast, in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the children were born before China instituted its one-child population policy. This was also at a time when the country was just beginning to shift from communism to capitalism. The family was poor, and sometimes there wasn't enough to eat. Little Sister struggled in school.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR\\n\\nShe even studied so hard, even harder than anyone else in the family, Big Sister said. She never got good scores.\\n\\nAgainst the family's wishes, Little Sister left school at 16 and moved to the city. With few skills, she fell into sex work.\\n\\nIt's just for survival, said Big Sister. A couple of times, she called me when I was abroad and she was beaten. Her nose was broken.\\n\\nStarting in the 1990s, tens of millions of women moved from the countryside to the city to earn money, as China shifted from being a nation of farmers to one of urban workers. Many women worked in factories. The brighter ones went into professions. Big Sister, for instance, became a nurse. Those with fewer skills, like Little Sister, sometimes ended up in massage parlors.\\n\\nIn the old communist China, the two sisters would probably have lived similar, circumscribed lives — essentially poor and rural. Under capitalism, they had new opportunities in an increasingly competitive society — which was less predictable and carried more risk.\\n\\nAfter saving some money, Little Sister quit sex work and moved more than 2,000 miles away to the southwest corner of the country. Amid the warmer, more relaxed climate of Yunnan, she tried to reinvent herself — something that is becoming as much a part of modern Chinese culture as it is in the U.S. Little Sister studied business books to learn about investing. She looked into buying a bar and becoming a legitimate businesswoman.\\n\\nA Sudden, Short Marriage\\n\\nIn the fall of 2013, she surprised her family and suddenly married a rubber farmer. After little more than a month, though, she left him. She told Big Sister that her husband accused her of cheating on him. Big Sister wondered if her little sister's past — which she had moved to Yunnan to bury — was coming back to haunt her.\\n\\nDoes he know what you did before and is that the reason he watches you so closely? Big Sister asked in a series of WeChat audio messages, which she's preserved. If that's the case, he'll never trust you.\\n\\nLittle Sister said her husband grew suspicious because she often traveled alone to a city several hours away to check on some investments that she'd kept secret from him. She said her husband began to beat her.\\n\\nI told him, 'Don't beat me anymore,'  Little Sister said over WeChat.  'My injuries haven't healed. If you beat me again, I couldn't bear it.' \\n\\nLittle Sister was now 34. Her attempts to find a lasting relationship and turn her life around weren't working.\\n\\nI myself feel empty, always feel empty, Little Sister said as she wept. I simply want to find a man who dearly loves me. Why is it so difficult?\\n\\nShe wanted a divorce, but said she was too afraid to face her husband again. A lawyer told her if she disappeared for two years, she could obtain a divorce without having to appear in court. She told her big sister she was heading to another part of the province to start anew.\\n\\nYou don't need to worry, she reassured Big Sister. I got off the bus yesterday and am now staying at a hotel.\\n\\nThat was Nov. 22, 2013. According to police, she checked out of a hotel a few days later.\\n\\nNo one has heard from her since.\\n\\nLast year, a sign of hope emerged. Police received an alert that Little Sister's ID number had been used at a bank in Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China where she'd previously lived. The cops thought she was following the lawyer's advice and was in hiding.\\n\\n'She Really Ran Away'\\n\\nOne of the last people to see her was her husband. So we drove up a dead-end dirt road, past banana groves, looking for his farmhouse. We were a little anxious. Police had told us he had recently spent time in jail for theft. The husband, a skinny 26-year-old, was surprised to see us, but courteous. He offered us tiny wooden stools, typical seating for guests in China's countryside.\\n\\nSoon, Big Sister confronted him.\\n\\nDo you know what happened exactly? she said angrily. Where did she go? Or did you kill her?\\n\\nIf I'd killed her, I wouldn't still be here, he said. She really ran away. You guys should not think that I sold her to someone or killed her. I've never done things like that.\\n\\nHe said the couple had quarreled a lot, but he denied ever beating her. The husband also said Little Sister was secretive about her past. The day they picked up their marriage license, in October 2013, the clerk asked her to produce a divorce certificate. Her husband-to-be was stunned.\\n\\nBefore we got our marriage license, she had just divorced a guy, just a month earlier, he said. When we were dating, she didn't tell me that.\\n\\nA Big Sister's Hopes Are Dashed\\n\\nThe next day, we had lunch with one of Little Sister's friends, a local businessman with chiseled good looks. The friend, who wore a black T-shirt, said Little Sister read lots of self-help books and was often depressed.\\n\\nShe gave out a feeling of loneliness, said the friend, who has a wife and son several provinces away, near Shanghai. She was clearly unhappy.\\n\\nWarm and gregarious, he talked for nearly two hours, but actually said very little. He insisted he had no idea where the woman was.\\n\\nWe were now down to our last lead. Big Sister booked a flight to Dalian, to follow up on the information from police about Little Sister's ID number showing up at the bank.\\n\\nI really hope it was her, she said, as we saw her off at the airport, so we are just a step away from finding her.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR\\n\\nBut that hope — the one that had kept Big Sister going throughout our journey — soon evaporated. Bank officials told her there had been a misunderstanding. Little Sister hadn't been to the bank after all. While the bank was reorganizing accounts, there was a computer glitch. Little Sister's ID number popped up, triggering an alert to police in Yunnan.\\n\\nBig Sister had arrived in China thinking her little sister was still alive. Now, she feared the worst.\\n\\nI don't think anything good happened to her, she said, choking back tears as we spoke over WeChat. She's a tough survivor. She would think of a way to contact somebody from the family or the police. I think she was probably killed by somebody.\\n\\nBut who? And why?\\n\\nA Forged Medical Report\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore returning to the U.S., Big Sister went to Little Sister's empty apartment in a city along the Mekong River, where she'd lived before she got married and had stored her belongings before going on the run. Big Sister discovered medical results on a coffee table, showing that her little sister was pregnant a few months before she disappeared. Earlier, her family had also found a love note revealing Little Sister was having an affair with the handsome businessman — something he'd denied during our long lunch.\\n\\nThere was something odd, too, about the pregnancy results. The little sister's given age was wrong, making her seem a decade younger. Puzzled, Yang and I went to the hospital that issued the document and showed a copy to several doctors.\\n\\nWhere was this test done? asked one physician. It's not done by us. Our department doesn't have a doctor by this name or an ID number like this. This report is fake!\\n\\nAnother physician called up Little Sister's medical records and found an earlier, legitimate pregnancy test, which had been negative. He said Little Sister appeared to have created the positive test report using a Microsoft Word document.\\n\\nWhy would someone forge a pregnancy test?\\n\\nSome girls want to take some leave from their jobs, said the first doctor. Others lie to a man, saying 'I'm pregnant' to get a sum of money.\\n\\nLittle Sister didn't have a job, but she did have some money, so Yang and I suspected there was probably another motive. What had started as a hopeful search was turning more ominous.\\n\\nYang and I called the businessman. We expected him to hang up. Instead, he spoke for 40 minutes and came clean about the affair. He said he and Little Sister had fallen in love.\\n\\nShe wanted me to get a divorce and then marry her, he explained. But I told her when this all started, 'I have a family.' \\n\\nHe said he broke up with Little Sister and last saw her in the fall of 2013, not long before she vanished. Given the heavy drug trade and human trafficking in this part of China, he said he assumed something terrible had happened.\\n\\nAfter such a long time, she could have contacted her family, he said. She's either been taken hostage or someone has murdered her.\\n\\nEnlarge this image Isabel Seliger for NPR Isabel Seliger for NPR\\n\\nThe Dark Side Of The Dream\\n\\nBig Sister thinks her sister's relationship with the businessman led to her disappearance, at least indirectly.\\n\\nIf he were not married, they probably would have a nice family together and my sister probably would end up with a nicer life, she said.\\n\\nLittle Sister's story of failed reinvention — with potentially fatal consequences — is a particularly Chinese one. Over the past two decades, under capitalism, something new has developed in China: individual dreams. It's one of the most exciting and encouraging developments in the country. People figure if they work hard, take risks, maybe they can succeed.\\n\\nBig Sister is emblematic of those dreams. She came from a poor farming village, eventually made it to America, continued her education there and landed an IT job.\\n\\nLittle Sister represents the dark side of the dream.

{"original": "Parler Insists It Would Not Knowingly Tolerate Criminal Activity On Its Site\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nParler is still seeking a way back onto the Internet. The company promoted itself as a free-speech site. It attracted a mixture of Republicans, self-identified conservatives, extremists and racists who found Twitter and Facebook too restrictive. Numerous media reports revealed Parler users explicitly calling for violence and then posting videos as they participated in last week's attack on the Capitol. Amazon and other services then cut ties with Parler, which sued. So what is or was the company's responsibility? Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff insists free expression was the goal.\\n\\nAMY PEIKOFF: We are trying to allow for maximum freedom of expression consistent with the law.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Parler also promised privacy, saying it would not analyze users' posts. Noted conservative figures were among the company's investors. And when President Trump was knocked off Twitter last week, some of his supporters called on people to migrate to Parler. But that site itself was on the way to being shut down, accused of failing to moderate extremist content. Peikoff maintains that all social media companies were flooded with calls to violence in recent months.\\n\\nWhat responsibility, if any, does Parler take for the content on your site?\\n\\nPEIKOFF: Our community guidelines were clear that we would not knowingly tolerate criminal activity on the site. We were trying to avoid using a system in which we would scan every piece of content with an automated algorithm. And so what we had was a community jury system in which any person on Parler could, of course, report a piece of content. We had a reporting mechanism. The report goes into a jury portal. And we had a, you know, bunch of volunteer jurors who were adjudicating these cases. And then the verdicts would come down, and the content would get removed as appropriate.\\n\\nINSKEEP: We should be frank that a lot of people migrated to Parler because they felt they could not lie as freely as they wanted to on the other social media platforms. What do you think about that?\\n\\nPEIKOFF: I wouldn't put it that way. I wouldn't put it that way. Not because they said they want to lie. Now, maybe there are some people. Of course, we've had some people come over who were bad actors and then would just tell all kinds of lies and everything else. I think everybody's got that. But people came over - some of them, not all of them - but some of them came over because they thought that they were being treated disproportionately unfairly on other sites and then, yeah, did come over.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Do you take as a company any responsibility for not just calls for violence but just obvious inciting lies about a stolen election?\\n\\nPEIKOFF: No. You know, I don't think that lies in and of themselves are inciting, right? So within a certain context, you could say that certain lies are. We could talk about, for example, whether that one speech that President Trump gave while the events at the Capitol were still going on and, you know, whereas he ended the speech with, go home in peace, but a lot of us found it not very convincing, given all of the preamble at the beginning. You could say, OK, in that context, he's telling certain lies and that that could be seen as a further incitement, given the ongoing activities on the ground at the day. So I see what you're getting at. But in terms of just lies themselves - and can you say that lies themselves are inciting the real world? No. When you're dealing with misinformation, we think the best anecdote is more information.\\n\\nINSKEEP: In Amazon's response to your company's lawsuit, they quote a number of posts on Parler. And I'm reluctant to quote them here, for - I just don't care to spread the messages. But they are obvious lies about a stolen election. There are specific calls to violence, calls for a civil war starting on Inauguration Day, urging people to form militias, urging people to, quote, shoot the police, urging people to hang specific public officials. This is just a partial list. When you read that list and know that it came across to people on your company, what do you think about?\\n\\nPEIKOFF: I mean, I don't want it there, obviously. But again, the question is, what mechanism do you use to detect and then remove that content? And the model that we had, as I said, as time went on through November and into December, when we started making these changes, we realized that we need to do more. And we were making those changes, and we were in discussions up with Amazon. You know, they dropped this on us on Friday afternoon. And we were telling them what we were doing and that we were willing to do more. We were starting, even, to program a bit of AI to figure out how we could use AI consistent with our mission over the weekend. And we had started tagging some content that way.\\n\\nSo we're definitely amenable to this. Nobody wants us on their platform. There is plenty of this content. Or at least there was on Facebook and Twitter, as well. All of them, as - you know, and I've heard from ex-policy people from other platforms saying that the challenges are everywhere. Even when you do use AI, it's not going to be 100% perfect. No, we don't like to see it. It's - it expressly violates our guidelines. And then the challenge is how best effectively to remove it and to make sure that our platform is designed not to encourage the sorts of sentiments that would lead to that type of content being posted in the first place.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, in our conversation, Amy Peikoff maintained that the Capitol attackers used other sources of disinformation, too. And that is true. NPR investigated the case of Ashli Babbitt, an attacker who was killed in the Capitol. Her social media feed showed that Babbitt gathered false claims from Fox News TV personalities and guests and repeated them on Twitter in the months before she went to her death. Even after Babbitt was killed, most Republicans in Congress voted, against all the evidence, to object to a Democratic election, following the lead of the defeated president. Whether Parler survives or not, disinformation is widespread.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PHELIAN'S INTRO)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Reaction To White House Directive On Transgender Bathrooms\\n\\nThe Obama administration says schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. David Greene talks to Matt Sharp of the Alliance Defending Freedom.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nA letter is going out later today from the Obama administration to every school district in the country. It says schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. This move was quickly welcomed by Mara Keisling. She's the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. She said she hopes that parents can set their biases aside as the new rules are implemented.\\n\\nMARA KEISLING: There's all sorts of kinds of kids that other people's parents don't feel comfortable with, and that's not how we decide who gets to learn safely in school. All children get to learn safely in school.\\n\\nGREENE: And let's hear another voice now. It's Matt Sharp. He's an attorney with the faith-based legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which has opposed similar policies in public schools across the country. Mr. Sharp, good morning.\\n\\nMATT SHARP: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, thanks for things coming on the program. We appreciate it. Let me just ask you - I mean, the administration, this letter going out this morning. The real foundation of it is this federal law called Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in schools. And the administration is saying this protects transgender people based on their gender identity. Tell me your reaction to that reading of the law.\\n\\nSHARP: Well, it's completely wrong. For over 40 years now, Congress and courts that have looked at Title IX have all consistently said Title IX was meant to combat sex discrimination. It's never been interpreted to include gender identity, and so the idea was always to ensure equal opportunities for men and women. Importantly, Title IX was specifically written to protect student privacy. It allows schools to have separate restrooms and locker rooms and dormitories on the basis of sex. So what the Obama administration is doing here is essentially rewriting the law, ignoring Congress, ignoring the normal process they're supposed to go through to force their agenda on schools across the country.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, what would you tell a family with a transgender child who identifies as a girl or a boy and believes that their girl or boy is going to school and deserves those protections under Title IX and believes very much in what the Obama administration is doing and wants their child to be protected and not discriminated against?\\n\\nSHARP: Well, their child should absolutely be protected against bullying, harassment or anything else. And we've seen schools across the country do a great job of protecting every student under their care. But part of that duty of protection is also protecting the right of privacy. And so we're hearing from lots of students across the country and parents saying this violates our right to privacy when we're forced to share locker rooms, showers and restrooms with someone of the opposite sex. And so that's actually what motivated, I think, over 130 parents and students in Chicago to actually sue the federal government because they came in and forced the school to open up their restrooms and locker rooms to the opposite sex.\\n\\nGREENE: Can you understand, though, that the family or parents of a transgender child who believes this is a delicate situation, but that their - the rights of their child might - you know, might be more important than sort of another child having to sort of get used a situation that he or she might find, you know, a little sensitive in a bathroom?\\n\\nSHARP: Well, but it's not about one student's rights being more important than another. It's about protecting every student's rights to privacy. And so what we've seen schools do is offer accommodations to any student, including transgender students, that are not comfortable with communal restrooms, allowing them to use single-stall restrooms or whatever's available so that they've got a choice. But they also have a duty to protect every other student's constitutional right to privacy when the courts across the country have recognized as implicated when you've got restrooms and locker rooms and why Title IX was drafted the way it is. So schools have to protect that. And what they're trying to do is make sure that every student has a place where they can use restroom, change and shower and feel comfortable without having to break down our traditions of having separate restrooms on the basis of biological sex.\\n\\nGREENE: Let me just - you're representing 51 families in a school district in Illinois, which allows students to use bathrooms according to gender identity, and these families are fighting that policy. Can you tell me the story of just maybe one family and exactly on a personal level what they're objecting to?\\n\\nSHARP: Absolutely. And so we've got several families there that the Obama administration came in and forced the District 211 to allow a biological boy into the female's restrooms. And so these girls are telling stories about how when they're in their locker room changing for PE, they're now uncomfortable knowing that a boy can walk in at any time under the school's new policy. They talk about how one girl in particular does not change out of her gym clothes but rather wears them all day long, wears them after going to gym, after getting them dirty and nasty through PE class and then just puts her clothes on top of it because she's so nervous about the possibility of having to change and shower and whatnot in front of this boy. And we hear stories like that across the country of these girls speaking out and saying, look, we don't want this student to be bullied or harassed or anything, but we also want our privacy protected. And we just want to know that when we go into these lockers and shower rooms that we're not going to be forced to share with someone of the opposite biological sex. That's all these girls are asking for.\\n\\nGREENE: Matt Sharp is an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, a faith-based legal advocacy group. Mr. Sharp, thanks for your time this morning.\\n\\nSHARP: Thank you so much.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

They greeted each other at the airport with a long hug.\\n\\nThis moment comes over three years since Saudi Arabia first ended diplomatic relations, trade ties and travel with Qatar, cutting off the country's access to Saudi airspace, ground entrances and seaports.\\n\\nThat summer, Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain issued 13 demands of Qatar, including that Qatar dismantle its news media agency, Al Jazeera, and scale back its diplomatic relationship with Iran. The countries also accused Qatar of backing terrorist organizations and urged it to end its links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\nThe new agreement reverses Saudi bans on Qatari people and business entering the country. In response, Qatar has ended its international lawsuits filed against Saudi Arabia for shutting off its airspace and borders, as reported by The New York Times.\\n\\nJared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, and White House adviser, was also present at the signing.

{"original": "U.S. Still Lags In COVID-19 Workplace Safety, Former OSHA Official Says\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP\\n\\nAs COVID-19 deaths and illnesses mount, essential workers — who are denied the chance to work from home — are struggling to stay safe. And it's far from clear whether the federal government is doing enough to protect them, according to a former top federal workplace safety official.\\n\\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration official, Deborah Berkowitz, said the Trump administration has neglected COVID-19 safety at meatpacking plants and many other workplaces.\\n\\nWhat keeps me up at night is that nine months after the beginning of the pandemic, that there are still no specific requirements that as a nation, every business that has employees has to implement to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, said Berkowitz, a former chief of staff and senior policy adviser at OSHA under President Barack Obama. She's currently the worker health and safety program director for the National Employment Law Project.\\n\\nIn an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Berkowitz said she guesses OSHA should have done 10,000 to 20,000 safety inspections since March and instead has done only a few hundred. OSHA has been AWOL, she said.\\n\\nIn comment to NPR, OSHA Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Loren Sweatt said Berkowitz pulled isolated alleged incidents out of context. The agency, Sweatt said, has issued nearly 300 COVID citations and kept hundreds of thousands of workers safe on the job.\\n\\nBelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nLast spring, we heard a lot about viral outbreaks in workplaces like meatpacking plants, and the Trump administration actually intervened back then. Those employees became essential workers and companies said they would institute precautions and restrictions. Did they do that on any scale or did we take our eye off the ball?\\n\\nOh, this administration totally took its eye off the ball and completely failed to protect workers. The secretary of labor under President Trump, Eugene Scalia, decided there would be no requirements and just let employers do what they want to do voluntarily. Some of the plants put in these flimsy plastic barriers between workers where there's like 500 workers in a big room working shoulder to shoulder that even the CDC said to them does not protect workers unless you have social distancing 6 feet apart. And I think what you saw, which is really stunning, is you saw the administration come in to protect an industry so that they wouldn't have to protect workers. I mean, time and time again, CDC weakened its guidance when the meat industry asked them to so they could keep making a profit. But it spread like wildfire.\\n\\nWhat does OSHA need to do right now to make workplaces safe from the spread?\\n\\nOSHA has been AWOL. I helped run that agency for six years. And at the beginning of the pandemic in the middle of March, when I got calls from meatpacking workers, health care workers, I said, just call OSHA. And OSHA actually told workers there's nothing we can do. We're not inspecting. Usually, OSHA, during the last nine months, would have done 10,000, maybe 20,000 inspections. They did a couple hundred.\\n\\nSounds like you're waiting for this new presidential administration for any changes to take place and therefore a new OSHA. But time is of the essence. What do workers need right now?\\n\\nWorkers really need to have employers follow the basic CDC guidance of social distancing, masks, notification when there are cases. And also they need to be able to speak up when they know that there are unsafe conditions and not be retaliated against. The bottom line, I think what you find out in this pandemic and the public should realize is worker-safety rights right now are really weak. And maybe this pandemic will cause us to rethink this ability of workers to protect themselves, which right now they really don't have.\\n\\nWhen a vaccine arrives for essential workers, what other hurdles will they have to overcome?\\n\\nBecause you had a president that downplayed the virus, that downplayed the seriousness of the virus, that made up how you cure this virus, there's huge distrust now in the federal government and what they're advising. And so I do think that one of the first things the Biden-Harris team has to do is to launch a huge campaign to build the public's trust, but also to work with the states to develop better mechanisms to deliver this vaccine to essential workers.\\n\\nNina Kravinsky and Jan Johnson produced and edited the audio version of this story.

That was back when Trump was trying to negotiate a trade deal with China.\\n\\nLast year, BuzzFeed News used satellite images to identify what it said were hundreds of recently built internment camps in Xinjiang – large facilities that resemble prisons. China's government has disagreed with that description, saying the installations are vocational education and training centers.\\n\\nA researcher published a report in Foreign Policy last summer saying that China's suppression of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other groups meets the U.N. definition of genocide, citing a campaign of mass sterilizations, forced abortions and mandatory birth control.\\n\\nPompeo's remarks were welcomed by the advocacy group Refugees International, whose president, Eric Schwartz, said that in Xinjiang, the evidence of genocide is significant and substantial.\\n\\nSchwartz called for international investigations and prosecutions over the treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

His job was to court and hire candidates for engineering and technology positions. In court documents filed in January, he alleges Google's quota-based hiring practices systematically instructed recruiters to purge eligible Caucasian and Asian candidates from potential hiring pools. He says they were told to favor applicants from underrepresented groups within the company. That meant interviewing only Hispanic, African-American or female job seekers.\\n\\nCalifornia labor law prohibits employers from making job decisions based on characteristics like race or gender.\\n\\nThe lawsuit describes several instances in which Wilberg says he raised concerns with supervisors and human resources executives only to allegedly be retaliated against. Wilberg claims he and other recruiting team members were made to feel completely uncomfortable and psychologically unsafe reporting to their boss, a champion of the diversity policies.\\n\\nHe also alleges Google subjected him to unsubstantiated performance reviews, performance criticisms and [terminated] his employment. Wilberg was fired in November 2017.\\n\\nThe court documents recount alleged conversations wherein several employees complained to Google managers about the company's diversity hiring practices. Although he maintains that Google favored minorities, Wilberg declares that one recruiter told her peers that she felt the way the team talked about black people in team meetings was like we were talking about black slaves as slave traders on a ship. In another encounter, Wilberg recalls, One team member complained that managers were speaking about blacks like they were objects.\\n\\nGoogle has denied the company implemented discriminatory policies toward Caucasian and Asian men. In a statement to Gizmodo, the company said it will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\\n\\nGoogle added:\\n\\nWe have a clear policy to hire candidates based on their merit, not their identity.

{"original": "Get Set For Trump Revisions To Your Affordable Care Act Insurance\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gary Waters/Ikon Images/Getty Images Gary Waters/Ikon Images/Getty Images\\n\\nRepeal and replace is on-again, off-again, but that doesn't mean the rules affecting your insurance will stay the same in the meantime.\\n\\nThe Trump administration late Thursday issued a final rule aimed at stabilizing the existing health law's insurance marketplace that could have rapid, dramatic effects — perhaps as soon as early summer — on people who do not get insurance through work, and buy it on the Affordable Care Act's exchanges instead.\\n\\nThe final rule upholds much of what was proposed by the administration in February, including a shorter enrollment window, tighter vetting of people who sign up outside of those open periods and efforts to require some consumers to show proof of prior insurance coverage.\\n\\nThe controversial proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services drew letters from nearly 4,000 organizations and individuals during an unusually short, 20-day public comment period that ended in early March. In their comments, consumer advocacy groups decried the proposal, saying it would wreak havoc by making it harder to get coverage. Insurers were generally supportive.\\n\\nBut some specialists in the health law, including Christopher Condeluci of CC Law & Policy in Washington, D.C., saw the initial proposal released in February by HHS as helpful for insurers, though he also thought more adjustments were necessary.\\n\\nDoes it meet all the carriers' asks when it comes to what changes are needed? No, I don't think it goes far enough, said Condeluci, a former staffer to the Senate Finance Committee who specialized in insurance issues.\\n\\nSabrina Corlette, an attorney who studies the individual marketplace for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said the directive could result in fewer healthy enrollees — which insurers also would not like — and doesn't address some of the biggest concerns for the insurance industry, such as the fate of federal subsidies that help low-income consumers pay deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's proposal, Corlette said, is nibbling away at the margins.\\n\\nShe could not be reached late Thursday for comment on the final version.\\n\\nHere are four ways the stabilization rule might change the individual health insurance market:\\n\\nIf you owe, you pay first\\n\\nThe final rule, to be published in the Federal Register next week, says consumers who want to sign up for an ACA plan with their same insurer for 2018 would have to repay past-due premiums from the previous 12 months before being granted new coverage. Because Obamacare has allowed a three-month grace period before people who haven't paid premiums are kicked out of coverage, a consumer's overdue premiums could tally hundreds of dollars — even more than $1,000.\\n\\nThe proposed change aims to discourage people from gaming the system. Insurers say a person with a bad knee, for example, might enroll and pay just long enough to get an expensive knee replacement, then stop paying premiums.\\n\\nBut wait, consumer groups and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners warned in their comment letters: There might be legitimate reasons people stop paying premiums — billing errors that are not the fault of the consumer, for example, or the loss of a job. By making such a change, the groups argue, the Trump administration violates a key part of the health law that requires insurers to offer coverage to just about everyone who applies.\\n\\nOnly those who can rapidly come up with a possibly significant sum of money by a given deadline can be guaranteed access to coverage, wrote Families USA.\\n\\nBetter act quickly\\n\\nOpen enrollment this fall (for 2018 health insurance coverage) would shorten to six weeks, down from three months. While opening day would remain the same — Nov. 1 — the final rule closes the marketplace on Dec. 15 instead of at the end of January. That period provides sufficient time for consumers to enroll, the administration has said, and would mean all who sign up would have a full year of coverage starting Jan. 1.\\n\\nThe shorter time period, the administration said, could also reduce the number of people who wait to enroll until after they find out they have a health problem. These late joiners are likely to use more health care than a healthy person their age, insurers and the Trump administration say, and can drive up the cost of insurance to everyone.\\n\\nConsumer groups argue the Trump plan could backfire, because those who tend to wait until the last minute to sign up are actually often the youngest and healthiest — and they may miss the enrollment window if it is shorter. Additionally, the deadline falls around the holidays, when money and time are often tight, which could have a chilling effect on insurance sign-ups.\\n\\nProve you have a reason — and maybe prior coverage\\n\\nThe ACA allows people to sign up outside the open enrollment period for a variety of special reasons, such as moving, losing coverage, getting married or having a child. This provision has always been a sticking point with insurers, who have maintained that too many customers who made a change during the special enrollment period were sicker and costlier than average. In response, the Obama administration tightened some of these requirements last year and announced it would run a pilot program starting this summer to randomly select half of all special enrollment applicants for verification review, holding up the applicant's insurance coverage until they provide the proper documentation.\\n\\nUnder the new rule, 100 percent of those applications would be required to undergo preapproval verification — beginning in June 2017. Consumers will have to provide documentation proving they qualify for special enrollment before getting coverage. The rule also says that for marriage, at least one member of the couple would have to prove they had health coverage for at least one day in the two months before their nuptials.\\n\\nConsumer groups are unhappy with the pre-verification idea — and the extra requirement of prior coverage for people who have gotten married. Particularly hard-hit would be couples who were uninsured previously because they could not afford health insurance as singles or could not get it under their state's Medicaid rules. Additionally, consumer advocates and some regulators say requiring newlyweds to prove prior coverage violates the health law.\\n\\nFlexibility — or higher deductibles?\\n\\nThe health law uses a complex formula to divide plans into metallic tiers — bronze, silver, gold and platinum — based on an average percentage of a typical year's health care bills that each level of plan covers. Bronze plans, for example, currently must cover an average of 60 percent of costs, while a silver one is 70 percent. Insurers are allowed wiggle room of plus or minus 2 percent around those averages.\\n\\nThe Trump rule tweaks the formula, allowing insurers to create plans with larger variations around the average. (It exempts certain silver plans for low-income consumers from the change.) So, for example, a bronze plan might cover only 56 percent of costs and silver 66 percent. Insurers say this would allow them to create plans that appeal to more customers, particularly those looking for lower premiums. But critics say the move would increase the size of deductibles.\\n\\nOne big problem in boosting enrollment has been that many potential consumers — particularly younger, healthier ones — say premiums are too high. But adjusting the law in this way could raise deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements, which consumers may dislike even more. While the health law sets a maximum cap per year on such payments, for many people those deductibles are already thousands of dollars annually. Under the proposal, deductibles could increase by more than $1,000 a year, according to an analysis by the consumer advocacy group Families USA.\\n\\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation."}

{"original": "Why It's So Hard To Know Whether School Choice Is Working\\n\\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\\n\\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a passionate proponent of expanding school choice, including private school vouchers and charter schools, and she has the clear backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her enthusiasm?\\n\\nExperts say one single, overarching issue bedevils their efforts to study the impact of school choice programs. That is: It's hard to disentangle the performance of a school from the selection of its students.\\n\\nStudents are never randomly assigned to a school. A school's population is always affected by local demographics. With schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.\\n\\nEven when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.\\n\\nFurther complicating matters is this: By law, most charter schools must have open enrollment, using a lottery if they have more applicants than spots. However, charters, and private schools, have sometimes been accused of using strict discipline rules or other measures to filter out underperforming or otherwise undesirable students.\\n\\nThe admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. Some must have open enrollment. Others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.\\n\\nAnd, no matter where you look, both private schools and charters tend to enroll fewer students with disabilities compared with public schools, a practice known as creaming.\\n\\nSo, with the huge caveat that it's difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison, where do researchers agree on the impact of choice?\\n\\nChoice programs seem to push nearby public schools to improve.\\n\\nThe results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.\\n\\nMartin Carnoy, a professor at Stanford University who has been studying the issue for decades, terms this response to competition an accountability effect. In other words, When you announce that there's a new sheriff in town, all of a sudden everybody perks up.\\n\\nCarnoy's studies of cities including Milwaukee argue that this effect fades over time.\\n\\nThere's far less agreement among researchers on the effects of choice for the students who choose to leave their traditional public school.\\n\\nFirst, charter schools. Charter students in city centers tend to do better than their public-school peers, according to the most recent research by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford. But charter students elsewhere tend to do the same or worse.\\n\\nAnd the learning progress of nearly 200,000 students enrolled in 100-percent online virtual charter schools is generally so bad that representatives of the charter sector recently called for states to close many of them.\\n\\nSecond, private schools. Whether students are using vouchers or tax-credit scholarships, their academic outcomes are a similarly mixed bag.\\n\\nMost studies find modestly positive or neutral impact on student scores, and that's generally limited to African-American students in large urban centers, says Micah Ann Wixom, a policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States.\\n\\nMartin Carnoy wrote for the left-leaning Economic Policy institute in February: Extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.\\n\\nDo voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school? asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.\\n\\nOr, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.\\n\\nBut more recent research has found that private schools, like charter schools, can actually hurt the academic progress of the students who choose them. Studies of programs in Louisiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., found students who left for private schools did worse, not better, compared with their peers.\\n\\nScholarship tax-credit programs, like voucher programs, send students to private schools. Their impact is hard to determine, says Harris of the Education Research Alliance.\\n\\nThe best-case scenario seems to be a slight positive effect, but most people would interpret it as no effect, he says.\\n\\nFinally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test. So these programs are a bit of a black box. Going forward, if private school options expand, we may know less and less about the schools that more and more students are attending.\\n\\nOh, and there's another challenge: Most of these analyses rely on test scores alone. Test scores provide an imperfect and incomplete picture of student performance, as the most recent reauthorization of the federal education law acknowledges."}
{"original": "Defiant Smugglers Ply Egypt-Gaza Border In Tunnels\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Said Khatib/AFP/Getty Images Said Khatib/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nEgypt is taking a more aggressive role in stopping the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip destined for Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that controls the territory.\\n\\nThe Egyptian border has long been a smuggling route in a multimillion-dollar business trade of food, goods, arms and rocket parts through desert tunnels.\\n\\nNear the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, Egyptian police are visible on every street corner. Green military vans that ferry security personnel are parked along the dusty roads.\\n\\nThe wind kicks up sand as Abu Talib, an Egyptian Bedouin who lives in a small concrete house with his wife and eight children, explains how things have changed for smugglers since the Israeli army offensive in Gaza.\\n\\nThe 23-day air and ground campaign in December and January sought to demolish the smugglers' tunnels and stop Hamas rocket fire on southern Israeli communities. When it ended, Israeli military officials said that over 80 percent of the tunnels were destroyed.\\n\\nSmuggling A Way Of Life On The Border\\n\\nNow that Egypt has tightened security, Abu Talib says many smugglers are out of the business and many tunnels were shut down.\\n\\nAfter the war, Israel complained about the stuff going through. They [Egypt] increased the security, not necessarily changed, just increased, and there is nothing going through now, he says.\\n\\nLife is hard here, he says. Abu Talib makes a small living from odd jobs with a truck he owns. His daughter, Hyah, says the Egyptian government offers no help, so many Bedouins become smugglers, for the money.\\n\\nFor some it's a matter of bread and butter, but for those who have a lot of money already — that's when they have the ability to say, 'Oh, I'm helping the Palestinians, too,'  she says.\\n\\nMatthew Levitt, a security expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says the stepped-up Egyptian security presence is in the government's interest.\\n\\nEgyptians have been doing much more than they had been, whether it's rotating senior officials in and out of the area to reduce the opportunity for bribery, shutting down a lot more tunnels, trying to do things farther into Sinai, he says. But this is something that is in the Egyptian national interest. And I think they see it that way.\\n\\nEgypt Sees Iranian Threat On Gaza Border\\n\\nWhen it comes to Gaza, Egypt's national interest has been tested more by Iran than by Israel, Levitt says.\\n\\nIn April, the Egyptian government announced it had rounded-up a weapons smuggling cell organized by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which receives support from Iran.\\n\\nCairo accused the arrested men of plotting to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak in a conspiracy backed by Iran. Egypt has been aggressive in challenging Iran's rising influence in the region. This is one factor in Egypt's vigilance on the border, Levitt says, as highlighted by the Hezbollah cell that was rounded up [and] engaged in operations both supporting and arming Hamas in the Gaza Strip and, according to the Egyptians, maybe even plotting attacks in Egypt.\\n\\nBut the government's accusations of an Iranian conspiracy have done little to dampen Egyptian sympathies for Palestinians in Gaza.\\n\\nAcross Egypt, there is frustration with the government's insistence on keeping the border with Gaza closed. Egyptians support the illegal tunnel trade, the only delivery system for Palestinians in Gaza still struggling to recover from the devastating Israeli military campaign.\\n\\nMain Trade In Tunnels Is Food, Not Arms\\n\\nThe Egyptians are not able to stop the smuggling entirely, not able or willing, because as long as the current situation in Gaza stands with the blockade, the tunnels are a necessary lifeline, says Issandr El Amrani, a Cairo-based analyst and writer.\\n\\nFood, not weapons, is the main product flowing through the tunnels, says Marc Lynch, an Egyptian specialist at American University in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nBut that poses a problem for the Egyptian government, he says.\\n\\nFor them, it's not an open-or-closed problem; it's a filtering problem. They need to figure out a way to let the essential foodstuffs in without having bullets smuggled in in a barrel of eggplants. That's hard to do, Lynch says.\\n\\nTunnels have been long used for smuggling along the Gaza border, especially after 1967, when Israel captured the territory. In the 1990s, under Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, Palestinians in parts of Gaza and the West Bank were granted limited autonomy.\\n\\nHamas took control of the enclave and routed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' security forces in June 2007, leading to a tight blockade of Gaza by Israel and increased rocket attacks on southern Israel by Hamas.\\n\\nNow, Egyptian security has been increased in the Sinai town of El Arish, near the Gaza border, says Abu Mohammed, who runs a well-stocked grocery store. Tunnel traffic is down, but not completely shut, he acknowledges.\\n\\nAs long as there is a need in Gaza, the smugglers will continue to dig deep into the Sinai desert and cross the border in tunnels, he says.\\n\\nWe get phone calls from Palestinians on the other side, he says. We know when everything gets there."}

{"original": "Background\\n\\nHow Long Has the Current Drought Been Going On?\\n\\nThe majority of Texas is currently experiencing in drought that started in October 2010. Most of the state has been under drought conditions for over three years.\\n\\nState Climatologist John-Nielsen Gammon has warned that Texas could be in the midst of a drought worse than the drought of record in the 1950s. 2011 was the driest year ever for Texas, with an average of only 14.8 inches of rain. 2011 also set new records for low rainfall from March through May, and again from June through August. The high summer temperatures increased evaporation, further lowering river and lake levels.\\n\\nThe state experienced a short and rainy respite in the winter and spring of 2012, but by the fall of 2012 dry conditions had returned to much of the state. Those persisted until late in the summer of 2013, when a sustained rainy period lowered the percentage of the state experiencing drought.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean that the drought is over. As of June, 2014, 70 percent of Texas is still in drought conditions, while 21 percent is in the worst two stages of drought, either extreme or exceptional drought. The state's reservoirs are 67 percent full.\\n\\nWhat Is Causing the Drought?\\n\\nThe main culprit of the intense 2011 dryness was La Niña, a weather pattern where the surface temperatures are cooler in the Pacific. This in turn creates drier, warmer weather in the southern U.S. (You may also know her counterpart, El Niño, which generally has the opposite effect.) La Niña sticks around for a year, sometimes longer, and tends to return once every few years. (The last La Niña was in 2007, but it was a much lighter one.)\\n\\nAn El Niño weather patten was predicted to bring some relief to the state in the winter of 2012-2013, but it failed to appear. The state climatologist predicted abnormally dry weather and higher than average temperatures through summer 2013, which could make the drought worse than the drought of record in the 1950s.\\n\\nIn February 2013, the state climatologist told the Texas Legislature that high temperatures related to climate change have exacerbated the drought. He said that the state's average temperature has increased by an average of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1970s.\\n\\nIf El Niño predictions for late 2014 prove correct, winter rainfall in Texas could be substantial. A study from Stanford University gives the El Niño weather pattern a 76 percent chance of returning in 2014.\\n\\nIt tends to cause the jetstream to be farther south than normal, which means we may get more rain events, generally cool temperatures and lots of run-off, which would be good for reservoir levels, John Nielsen-Gammen, Texas State Climatologist, said.\\n\\nHas This Happened Before?\\n\\nDrought is nothing new for Texas. In the 1950's a seven-year dry spell so momentous that it kicked off the modern era of water planning in Texas struck hard, destroying nearly 100,000 Texas farms and ranches. In response the legislature founded the Texas Water Development Board and local river authorities that constructed 62 new dams and reservoirs over the next two decades.\\n\\nIn 1984, The New York Times reported that heavy Texas rains had brought a merciful end to the worst drought in a generation.\\n\\nThe state fared well with over a decade of adequate rains, but in 1996 drought dealt a heavy blow to statewide ranching and agriculture. In May of that year, Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry said, this drought has the economic potential to be the worse natural disaster in the 20th century. The CBS Evening News featured Texas ranchers who were losing their herds to drought.\\n\\nIn response, the state legislature passed comprehensive water policy reform with Senate Bill 1 in 1997.\\n\\nRains returned but soon abated and in 1998 the Associated Press (AP) reported that the second drought to hit Texas in three years is leaving farmers in dire straights and taxing the state economy. The dry spell deepened through 1999, when the New York Times reported Worse Drought Than in '98 Appears Possible in Texas.\\n\\nIn 2000 Texas Department of Agriculture spokesman Allan Spelce told the New York Times, we are in the midst of an unmitigated disaster and it has been accumulating in magnitude over the last five years, after strains on water supply since 1996 caused $5 billion in losses to Texas agriculture.\\n\\nTropical storms hit the state in early 2001, rains picked up in 2002 and 2004 became one of the state's wettest years on record, bringing an end to the drought.\\n\\nDrought returned in 2005. In August of 2006, the Austin American-Statesman reported that 77 percent of the state's hay crop for cattle feed had been lost that summer.\\n\\nExtremely heavy rains in 2007 lifted Texas once again from drought and State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon told the AP, we've gotten so much rain this year we've pretty much made up for the past few years' drought conditions in several areas of the state.\\n\\nThen in 2008 Nielsen-Gammon said, less than a year after rains finally brought an end to the 2005-2006 drought in Texas, many parts of the state are again suffering drought conditions.\\n\\nDrought intensified through 2009, putting the most Texas counties in the deepest stage of drought since 2000 and from September 2008 to September 2009 became the driest one-year period yet for Texas, costing the state's cattle industry over $1 billion.\\n\\nIn January 2010, the New York Times reported an end to the worst drought to strike Texas in the last 50 years, but by May the State Climatologist said that areas of Texas facing drought conditions again. The drought that began in the fall of that year resulted in the single driest year in recorded Texas history and still hasn't abated.\\n\\nWhat Are the Effects of the Drought?\\n\\nThe drought has helped drain reservoirs, fuel wildfires, ruin crops, and put a real strain on the state's electric grid.\\n\\nDry conditions fueled a series of wildfires across the state in early September 2011. The most devastating, the Bastrop Complex Fire in Bastrop County, scorched over 34,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,300 homes.\\n\\nThe situation reached a new level of urgency in late January of 2012 when wells in the town of Spicewood Beach, Texas officially ran out of water. Some 1,100 residents now depend on tanker trucks to deliver water to the town's storage tank. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) owns the water system and is overseeing the emergency water operation. The agency is still trucking water into the town and will continue to do so until a surface water treatment plant can supply water from Lake Travis. The plant was scheduled to be finished in the summer of 2013, but Corix, the company that is building the plant, instead expects it to be finished in late February.\\n\\nThe low water levels in Central Texas took their toll on rice farmers near the coast. They rely heavily on water flowing out of the Highland Lakes on the Colorado River. In March, the combined lake levels remained below 850,000 acre feet, prompting the LCRA to cut off water supplies to farmers in Matagorda, Wharton and Colorado counties for the second year in a row. A third year of cutoffs for rice farmers is on the horizon. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is currently deciding whether or not to cut off water again.\\n\\nThe drought has also affected a wide range of industries in Texas. Economists estimate that the drought has cost farmers and ranchers upwards of $8 billion. Some farmers and ranchers have rented or leased parts of their properties to recreational hunters in an attempt to make up some of their lost profits.\\n\\nThe price of hay increased by 200 percent during the drought. Since the price of feeding cattle has skyrocketed, ranchers are culling their herds, selling off large numbers of cattle in auctions to out-of-state buyers. Crops also suffered, as corn outputs fell by 40% in 2011 and peanut production is down as well. The lack of crops has created conditions for severe dust storms across the western part of the state. Rains in 2013 improved the outlook somewhat for agriculture, but drought remained severe in much of the Texas Panhandle, an important agricultural region.\\n\\nOfficials from ERCOT, Texas' electric grid operator, are also concerned. Nuclear, coal, and natural gas energy production all require large amounts of fresh water to cool equipment. High energy usage and scorching temperatures caused ERCOT to close one factory overnight during the height of the summer's heat. Officials worry that another spring and summer with low rainfall could mean the closure of some power plants.\\n\\nTexas officials predicted the reserve margin (the amount of excess power available to the grid on top of what is already generated) will be healthy through the summer of 2014.\\n\\nWhen Will the Drought End?\\n\\nAs far as long term prospects, meteorologists are now forecasting that it will have to get a little worse before it gets better. Since summer rains are unpredictable, as state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon mentioned in an earlier interview, it is hard to tell what will happen next. The latest NOAA outlook predicts a mixed bag for Texas. While the central and eastern parts of the state will likely keep their current status, the drought might intensify from the Hill Country to the Panhandle and in much of West Texas.\\n\\nThe return of El Niño in 2014 could, however, be a salvation for much of drought-stricken Texas. A new study from Stanford University gives the El Niño weather pattern a 76 percent chance of returning this year.\\n\\nWhat to Expect in the Future\\n\\nWith no definitive end to the state's water woes in sight, the 83rd Texas Legislature voted to hold a referendum to decide whether the state will allocate $2 billion from the Rainy Day Fund to fund projects in the State Water Plan. Proposition 6 passed with an overwhelming majority, meaning that the $2 billion will launch a rotating loan program to fund conservation, pipelines, reservoirs, and other water projects that are approved by the Texas Water Development Board. Twenty percent of the fund is earmarked for conservation projects, and another 10 percent is set aside for rural water projects.\\n\\nThe drought, the extreme heat and the fires that came with it have made these historic years for Texas. And it will leave a mark that will be felt long after the drought is over: trees will continue to die from stress, roads will continue to break apart, and food prices will continue to fluctuate."}
{"original": "How The NFL's New Rule On Protesting Is Being Perceived By Players\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/AP\\n\\nThe NFL announced a new rule banning players from kneeling in protest during the playing of the national anthem before games. If they choose not to stand, they can stay in the locker room, but if they violate the new rule, their teams will be fined.\\n\\nThe policy decision comes after months of controversy and divisive debates on players taking a knee or making other statements as the national anthem is played.\\n\\nDuring the preseason in August 2016, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem. He was, at first, alone in his protest, but continued it into the regular season as countless others joined him.\\n\\nI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\\n\\nMore than a year after Kaepernick's original protests, President Trump expressed his disapproval on Twitter and at rallies, which sparked larger and more united protests among players and at times, entire teams.\\n\\nUntil the announcement on Wednesday of the new policy, the league and the players' union made no suggestions that such a change was coming.\\n\\nSince the announcement, Howard Bryant, sports journalist and author of The Heritage: Black Athletes, a Divided America, and the Politics of Patriotism, spoke with NPR's Weekend Edition about the reactions he's heard from players and what might happen before the official start of next season.\\n\\nWell I think they've taken the position that the NFL has decided to fully engage with this culture war initiated by the president, Bryant says. When [President Trump] first attacked the NFL players in September, one of the questions of the book that I was asking was 'Who gets to be the patriot?' \\n\\nWhen the president began commenting on the players' protests he called them unpatriotic, Bryant says. Trump then said players choosing to take a knee or sit during the national anthem shouldn't have jobs.\\n\\nSince then Trump has praised the new rule announcement, but questioned whether those who don't stand for the anthem should be allowed to stay in the U.S.\\n\\nWell, I think that's good, Trump said in an interview with Fox News. I don't think people should be staying in locker rooms, but still I think it's good. You have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there, maybe you shouldn't be in the country.\\n\\nBryant says the new rule makes it appear that the NFL is going along with it as well. I think that this has really reignited some really bad blood between the players and the owners.\\n\\nThat bad blood comes after many players thought they had reached an agreement on the matter last season.\\n\\nThey had agreed with the owners to a $90 million partnership to fight social [injustice], so I think that they had believed that they had reached an accommodation, Bryant says. Now we're seeing that that accommodation isn't such an accommodation and I think the players are trying to strategize with their union to figure out just what's going to happen.\\n\\nThis latest move by the league, Bryant says, is seen as a hostile act by the players. There's no question about that.\\n\\nEven with the new rule, the debate on the issue is not over as many continue to debate what it is the players are protesting when they take a knee.\\n\\nBryant says players have said they are protesting police brutality, but others see this as an issue of respect for veterans and those who have served the country.\\n\\nNobody wants to see the flag or the national anthem weaponized, Bryant says. They don't want to see citizenship weaponized and the veterans that I've spoken with do not want to be used as commercial props and yet sports is doing both.\\n\\nThe phrase weaponizing patriotism has been used frequently in this debate. Bryant says the players do not want their citizenship questioned, and that what they're doing in this protest is the ultimate example of citizenship.\\n\\nIt is how those protests are framed, Bryant says, that begin to weaponize patriotism.\\n\\nWhat we've seen in sports over the last couple of years now is to paint the players as unpatriotic, he says. Instead of thinking about their reasoning — which is police misconduct and about supporting some of the people who don't have a lot of power in our country — it's been directed toward the flag as if the players don't care about their country when actually, they do."}

McConnell had urged senators to be respectful of Roberts, who is supervising the trial as specified in the Constitution while also attempting to keep above the partisan aspects.\\n\\nMadness\\n\\nHouse impeachment manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took issue with the wide view of presidential powers put forth by Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz on Wednesday.\\n\\nIn response to a question about whether a quid pro quo in the foreign policy arena was ever appropriate, Dershowitz said, Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest.\\n\\nHe added, If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\\n\\nAfter wide condemnation by Democrats and on social media, Dershowitz said his comments were misinterpreted.\\n\\nBut Schiff declared, That way madness lies, if we are to accept the president essentially can do whatever he wants.\\n\\nJoin us\\n\\nThe answer to one question posed by Republican senators must have brought joy to the president's ears. Asked whether the president has the best interests of Americans and their families in mind, Trump attorney Eric Herschmann recited a litany of positive economic statistics in what may have sounded like a Trump reelection ad.\\n\\nThere are more than 7 million jobs created since the election. Illegal border crossings are down 78% since May, and 100 miles of the wall have been built. The unemployment rate is the lowest in 50 years, he said.\\n\\nTurning to the House managers, he concluded, Maybe we could even get more done. Let's try something different now. Join us. Join us. One nation, one nation, one people.\\n\\nSen. Warren considers chief justice's position\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had a sharply worded question for the House managers.\\n\\nAt a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court and the Constitution?\\n\\nSchiff answered by first saying, The chief justice has presided admirably.\\n\\nHe added that the country does deserve a fair trial, which, for Democrats, means calling witnesses.\\n\\nIf they don't get that fair trial, it will just further a cynicism that is corrosive to this institution and to our democracy, Schiff said.\\n\\nAcquittal at hand?\\n\\nThe Senate is expected to finish the 16 hours of written questions on Thursday night. On Friday, the Senate is expected to convene at 1 p.m. ET and have up to four hours of debate — equally divided between the managers and president's counsels — on whether to consider more evidence or witness testimony.\\n\\nIt is possible that at the end of that debate (or any time during or thereafter), the Senate will go in to closed session for private deliberation on the witness question. Only in closed deliberation can they speak to one another on the floor. There is no time limit for closed deliberations.\\n\\nIf the motion to consider more evidence is approved — a 51-vote majority is required — then senators can offer motions on which witnesses and documents they want to subpoena.\\n\\nA 50-50 tie fails. Technically, the presiding officer, Roberts, could move to break a tie, but he is not expected to insert himself into a political process.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nIf the motion fails, there are still any number of procedural motions Democrats could offer, and there is potential for another long series of votes. For example, Democrats could offer motions requesting more time to debate, but these would likely be delaying tactics or protest votes that will not affect the outcome.\\n\\nWhen the lawmakers are done debating all motions, the Senate will then vote on each article of impeachment. Those votes could occur as early as Friday evening. Republicans would like Trump to be acquitted by then, but Democrats are working to recruit enough members to support bringing in witnesses to testify.\\n\\nThat effort is flagging, senators say.\\n\\nThe momentum is clearly in the direction of moving to final judgment on Friday, said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. We still have a couple members who said they want to listen to answers to questions, but that's where the momentum is in the caucus right now.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tried to walk a tightrope when he gave his assessment on the possibility of bringing in witnesses.\\n\\nProbably no, Schumer told reporters on Wednesday. But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.\\n\\nDemocrats need to persuade at least four Republicans to cross party lines in order to lock in enough votes to subpoena witnesses.\\n\\nAmong the most-discussed potential witness is Bolton, who has drawn attention because of a report in The New York Times that he wrote in a forthcoming book that the president had directly linked the aid for Ukraine to an investigation of the Bidens.\\n\\nSpeaking before Thursday's session, Schiff said the Trump administration has gone to extraordinary lengths to put a muzzle on John Bolton to avoid calling him as a witness, to avoid letting the American people hear what he has to say.\\n\\nAnother House manager, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, left the door open to the possibility that the House may subpoena Bolton if the Senate doesn't.\\n\\nWe will see, Nadler said.\\n\\nRepublicans' witnesses\\n\\nIf the door does open to witnesses, Republicans have indicated they would like to call people such as Hunter Biden, who had served on a Ukrainian energy company board.\\n\\nRepublicans might also call the whistleblower.\\n\\nAsked what kind of delay witnesses would add to the trial, Trump defense lawyer Jay Sekulow said months.\\n\\nThis would be the first of many weeks.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Senate Television via AP Senate Television via AP\\n\\nBut Schiff bristled at this argument, saying Trump's defense team is exaggerating the delay to discourage senators from supporting calling witnesses, including Bolton.\\n\\nYou can subpoena John Bolton, Schiff said. Don't be thrown off by this claim, 'Oh, if you even think about it, we are going to make you pay with delays like you've never seen. We're going to call witnesses that will turn this into a circus.' It shouldn't be a circus. It should be a fair trial. You can't have a fair trial without witnesses.\\n\\nSome Republicans have been discussing a possible deal involving a witness-for-witness swap, in which Bolton might be exchange for Biden. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that if Republicans are able to call just one witness, it will be Biden.\\n\\nBecause he's incredibly relevant to whether or not President Trump had a reason to believe that corruption was afoot in the Ukraine, Graham told reporters on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe speaker: This will leave a mark\\n\\nAt her weekly news conference on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said nothing can remove the asterisk Trump will now carry after having been impeached by the House.\\n\\nTrump will not be acquitted, she said. You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial. You don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation. I would hope that the senators, if it comes to a tie or if there's a question of hearing testimony or receiving documents, they would leave it up to the chief justice.\\n\\nPelosi also said she was very proud of our managers, saying they have been magnificent custodians of the Constitution.\\n\\nNPR's Brakkton Booker, Lexie Schapitl and Claudia Grisales contributed to this report."}

No longer will they force local officials to intermingle boys and girls within private areas like locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms on school trips and restrooms.\\n\\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who brought the lawsuit against the Obama administration, said he agreed with the Trump administration's decision.\\n\\nOur fight over the bathroom directive has always been about former President Obama's attempt to bypass Congress and rewrite the laws to fit his political agenda for radical social change, Paxton told Reuters.\\n\\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos addressed student safety in a statement shortly after the policy change announcement, which her department supported.\\n\\nShe wrote, at my direction, the Department's Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools.\\n\\nThe heads of two national LGBT advocacy groups, PFLAG and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, accused DeVos of causing unnecessary fear and confusion among transgender students and their families by allowing federal protections to be rescinded.\\n\\nGinger Clifton, who lives in Michigan and whose teenage daughter Kylie is transgender, spoke to reporters on Thursday, along with attorneys from the ACLU.\\n\\nKylie has been using the girls' bathroom for two years, she said. Nobody feels threatened. Just because someone is uncomfortable doesn't mean my daughter should have to walk across the school to use a unisex bathroom.\\n\\nOne American student has taken on a particularly public role in the national conversation about the rights of trans people in public schools.\\n\\nSeventeen-year-old Gavin Grimm is the plaintiff in a case challenging the right of his local school board to bar him from the boys' bathrooms at his high school. The case will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in March.\\n\\nEvery day I go in and I face the reality that I'm not allowed to use the same restroom as my peers, Grimm told NPR's All Things Considered on Thursday. I face the looks and the whispers and the comments and just the general increased isolation.\\n\\nThe senior from Gloucester County, Va., was initially allowed by the school principal to use the boys' bathroom. But after complaints from some parents, the school board adopted a policy that required students to use either the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex or a separate single-stall restroom.\\n\\nGrimm sued the school board. His lawsuit argues the bathroom policy is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment and violates Title IX of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination by schools.\\n\\nWhen you're trying to focus on aspects of high school life — getting homework done, studying for tests, preparing yourself for college — and you have to worry about being seen as who you are in a class environment, and you have to worry about planning restroom trips and you have to worry about being embarrassed and stigmatized every time you have to raise your hand and say, 'Can I go to the bathroom,' it redirects your attention in a very, very significant way, and to something that's so profoundly negative, Grimm explained to NPR's Ari Shapiro.\\n\\nWhen you are in a school environment with an administration that says this student is different, this student should be separate, and pointing that kind of finger and putting that kind of target on the child's back, it will absolutely negatively affect your ability to focus and succeed and flourish in a school environment."}
{"original": "Report: Rural Poverty In America Is 'An Emergency'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Marc Romanelli/Blend Images/Getty Images Marc Romanelli/Blend Images/Getty Images\\n\\nThe United States does not stack up favorably when compared to other nations with advanced economies when it comes to childhood poverty worldwide, according to a new report, which considered factors such as the lack of access to quality food, high adolescent birth rates and a child dropping out of school.\\n\\nOut of 175 nations, the U.S. ranks 36th – far behind Singapore, Slovenia, Norway, Sweden and Finland, which round out the top five — and just behind Bahrain and Belarus in the report produced by the advocacy group Save the Children.\\n\\nWe are just above Russia, Kuwait and Bosnia, says president and CEO Carolyn Miles. So I wouldn't say that the United States is doing terribly well as far as childhoods.\\n\\nThe report looks at so-called childhood enders or events that rob children of their childhood and prevent them from reaching their full potential, including things like displacement due to war, gender bias, child labor and child mortality.\\n\\nThere are three childhood disruptors that account for why the U.S. ranking is relatively low, says Miles, One was our infant mortality rate, which is by global standards, pretty high. The second was the teen pregnancy rate, which, although it's getting better in the United States, it's still, again, globally quite high, Miles says.\\n\\nAnd then the third was the number of children that are actually victims of homicide in the United States.\\n\\nIn total, the report estimates more than 1.2 billion children worldwide are at risk of missing out on childhood.\\n\\nThough, the report does say there is welcome news when comparing numbers last year to this year.\\n\\nThe index finds the overall situation for children appears more favorable in 95 of 175 countries. In 40 other countries, however, conditions appear considerably worse.\\n\\nPoverty in the U.S.\\n\\nIncluded in the report is a U.S. component that focuses on rural poverty in America, which the report calls an emergency.\\n\\nAccording to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly a quarter of children growing up in rural America were poor in 2016, compared to slightly more than 20 percent in urban areas.\\n\\nIt was a southwestern state, Arizona, according to the report, that had the highest rural child rate of any state, with 36 percent.\\n\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the report found the highest concentrations of child poverty, overall, in the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia and on Native American reservations.\\n\\nLooking at poverty, regardless of geography, research released last year from progressive-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities found that child poverty in the United States fell to a record low in 2016, to 15.6 percent. That's down from 28.4 percent in 1967.\\n\\nThe robust progress against child poverty is largely an unheralded development. So is the role of government programs in driving this progress, the authors of the report wrote at the time of its release.\\n\\nDanilo Trisi, one of those authors, says the drop in child poverty was due in large part to the federal safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, and the earned income tax credit help low-income families make ends meet.\\n\\nAt the same time, the U.S. doesn't do as much as other countries to protect children from poverty, Trisi says.\\n\\nWhen child poverty is compared across wealthy countries and before taking into account government assistance programs, he says, there's not that much difference between child poverty in the U.S. and child poverty in the well-off nations.\\n\\nBut because those countries have a stronger safety net, fewer children [in those countries] live in poverty.\\n\\nIn recent months, Save the Children and other western charity organizations have been the subject of sexual misconduct allegations. As NPR reported in April, Sir Alan Parker resigned his post as chair of Save the Children International. The move came on the heels of accusations of inappropriate behavior leveled against former leadership."}
{"original": "Anger, Confusion Over Dwindling Refunds. Is Trump's Tax Plan To Blame?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 4:39 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump promised that his tax changes, passed in 2017, would give most Americans a tax cut.\\n\\nHowever, as the first federal returns for 2018 come in, some taxpayers are discovering an unpleasant surprise: Their refunds are smaller than expected. In fact, as of Feb. 1, the average refund is down by about 8 percent from the same time last year, according to the IRS.\\n\\nThe reasons for these smaller refunds vary. For most people, it's because each paycheck has grown slightly, thanks to reduced withholding. On balance, they are likely to come out ahead.\\n\\nHowever, the smaller refunds have triggered shock and anger. Taxpayers faced with smaller refunds or higher taxes have been airing their grievances online with the hashtags #GOPTaxScam and #GOPTaxScamStories. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. and others have pushed back, claiming the complainers are misinformed.\\n\\nNicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation think tank, cautioned against getting angry for the wrong reasons. The Tax Foundation had advocated the 2017 tax overhaul as being pro-growth.\\n\\nDon't judge your taxes by your refund. That's only one part of the conversation, Kaeding said. Moreover, she added, Ideally, you don't actually want to receive a large refund. Because what you've done is given the federal government an interest-free loan. Instead, what would be better is to adjust your withholdings so you get more take-home pay in every paycheck.\\n\\nThe Tax Foundation has posted a calculator for taxpayers to compare what they owe this year to what they would have owed under the old tax code. Kaeding estimates that 80 percent of tax filers received a tax cut from the overhaul, while 5 percent saw their taxes go up.\\n\\nEven after accounting for withholding, some people are paying more in taxes. Kaeding said people who saw their taxes increase tend to be high earners in areas with higher state and local taxes.\\n\\nHowever, some people of limited means have also seen their taxes rise.\\n\\nVictoria Pearl Wright said she and her husband expected to get a tax refund similar to the $5,085 check they received last year. Wright, 24, is nine months pregnant, and she said she planned to use that check to cover expenses when she takes unpaid maternity leave as venue manager at a cafe-bar in Houston. But this year Wright did not get a refund. Instead, she said she and her husband owe $79.\\n\\nWhen I did my taxes and saw that we weren't getting a refund, I was so emotionally floored, I had nothing but shock go through my body, Wright said.\\n\\nWright said she did notice a slight increase in pay each month — but only about $30 for herself and her husband each on average. She believes her taxes rose because they lost the ability to deduct business expenses and, as a result, earned slightly too much to qualify for the earned income tax credit. She has asked friends to donate to a maternity leave fund she opened on PayPal.\\n\\nMark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said others may face challenges similar to Wright's predicament. He said people who have children older than 17 are not eligible for the standard child tax credit; instead they get a smaller dependent credit and lose a personal exemption. People who had large deductions for state and local taxes now have those deductions capped at $10,000. His organization estimates that 6 percent of households will see an individual income tax hike this year.\\n\\nA lot of people are focused on the amount of refund they get, and when they have a smaller refund then they expected, they're unhappy, Mazur said. In addition, there are some people who are having a tax increase. And I think what you're seeing on Twitter and elsewhere is kind of a conflation of both of those things.\\n\\nThat confusion was evident in debates that erupted online. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., noted the decline in the average tax refund. Let's call the President's tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%, the presidential hopeful wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nOne woman responded that her total taxes were $1,800 lower this year. Thanks, President Trump! she tweeted.\\n\\nTrump Jr. retweeted a Breitbart article that depicted Harris as Pinocchio. Of course refunds are down. People are paying less in taxes and the code is simplified, Trump Jr. wrote. Do you really not understand that? Now do the effect of proposed Dem tax hikes has on income!!!\\n\\nRichard Thaler, who received the 2017 Nobel Prize in economic studies, said when the Trump administration passed its tax cut, it also adjusted the withholding tables. That means the IRS took less money out of each paycheck. Changing the withholding tables did not require new laws and was not widely publicized, Thaler said.\\n\\nIn a world of rational economic actors, he said, lowering withholding would have made everybody happy, since they would be getting the money they would have to wait all year for, in each paycheck. But we don't live in that world, and people like refunds.\\n\\nThaler, who teaches at the University of Chicago, said most people don't know within $10 what their paycheck is. So a slight increase would have gone unnoticed. On the other hand, he said, people use withholding and the expected refunds as a de facto savings plan.\\n\\nPeople have trouble saving, Thaler said. For many people, the day they get their tax refund is the one day of the year that they're actually financially solvent.\\n\\nA Treasury Department spokesperson said the new tax law cut taxes across the board, particularly for middle-income families. Most people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut in larger paychecks throughout the year, instead of tax refunds that are the result of people overpaying the government. Smaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers.\\n\\nMazur of the Tax Policy Center said people worried they cannot afford higher taxes should file their returns on time anyway. He recommended paying as much as possible with the return and then calling the IRS to arrange a payment plan for the rest. Not filing a return on time can cause penalties that are often worse than the penalty for paying taxes late, he said.\\n\\nWhen the tax overhaul passed in 2017, fewer than half of Americans approved of it. Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, promised that more people would grow to like the tax plan once it took effect.\\n\\nWhen people see their withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's going to produce the results, Ryan said in 2017. Results are going to make this popular.\\n\\nThat does not seem to be the case. In September 2018, some 46 percent of Americans disapproved of the changes to the tax code, Gallup found.\\n\\nThe tax overhaul gave most Americans a break in what they owe the government; however, those tax gains were expected to be spread unevenly across income brackets, with high earners enjoying the biggest windfalls. Households earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see an average income increase of 4.3 percent after taxes, while households earning between $50,000 and $75,000 would see their income increase by an average 1.6 percent after taxes. In all, the average household was expected to get a tax cut of $1,610, the Tax Policy Center calculated.\\n\\nIndividual tax cuts are scheduled to expire in 2025."}
{"original": "South Korea Prepares To Spend $13 Billion On Winter Olympics. Is It Worth It?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP\\n\\nThe brand-new Olympic stadium in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will be used just four times before it's decommissioned after the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The venue will be used for opening and closing ceremonies for two Olympics, and then it will be demolished.\\n\\nThe $109 million stadium is raising questions about whether hosting the Olympics is worth the cost for cities that don't have existing infrastructure to accommodate the event. The Pyeongchang stadium is one of several new arenas, event spaces and lodging structures built for the Olympics, which could cost South Korea nearly $13 billion.\\n\\nDespite bold plans to repurpose Olympic buildings, past host cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and Athens, have been left with vacant, decaying sports complexes. Organizers in South Korea are planning to demolish some of the new buildings after the games rather than risk their becoming white elephants, says Judith Grant-Long, an associate professor of sport management at the University of Michigan and a co-director of the Michigan Center for Sport and Policy.\\n\\nIt's not so unusual to see temporary facilities used in the context of the Olympics, but this moves the needle towards disposable facilities, she tells Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd. And I think the cost of this particular venue at approximately $100 million is really making people sit up and take notice about the costs associated with building venues.\\n\\nThe region's modest population is one reason repurposing the stadium doesn't make much economic sense. There are only about 40,000 people in Pyeongchang County, which makes it almost impossible to regularly fill the new stadium that seats 35,000.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Milos Bicanski/Getty Images Milos Bicanski/Getty Images\\n\\nSouth Korean officials are hoping the Olympics will boost the area's population by creating a new tourism cluster, Grant-Long says. Olympic organizers in Sochi, Russia, had similar goals, but unlike Russians, South Koreans don't care much for winter sports. A survey taken last April by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism found that only 35.6 percent of people were interested in the Winter Olympics.\\n\\nThe other issue with the success of this particular strategy in that location is that South Koreans at this point in time are not particularly a winter sport people, Grant-Long says. So the idea of creating a tourism strategy that's based on winter sports, skiing and so forth, has not necessarily been a well-received idea from an economic development point of view.\\n\\nFinancial problems after the Olympics and other international sports events are common. It took Montreal 30 years to pay off its debts after the 1976 Olympics. The city's Olympic stadium was recently transformed into a refugee welcome center for asylum seekers entering Canada from the U.S.\\n\\nAthens spent more than $15 billion to stage the Summer Games in 2004, adding to the country's debt and sparking the current economic turmoil. The games did bring much needed development to the metro system, highways and an airport, but graffiti-covered stadiums remain unused.\\n\\nIn Rio, organizers are still staring down $40 million in debt incurred during the 2016 Summer Games after ambitious plans to convert arenas into schools collapsed. And the $550 million World Cup stadium in Brasilia, Brazil, was turned into a bus parking lot after the 2014 soccer tournament.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\\n\\nMost countries end up with a lot of debt, a lot of white elephants, and quite a bit of infrastructure investment that is not ideal for the type of development needs that the city has, Andy Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., told NPR in 2014.\\n\\nExperts say most cities that decide to host the Olympics will confront mountains of debt, especially if they don't have the infrastructure already. Construction companies often drive city officials to make higher bids by presenting more elaborate plans.\\n\\nIf you're going to organize the games, you have to be prepared for financial surprises — I'll put it politely — and debt, Olympic historian David Wallechinsky told NPR last year. But it can be done, and it has been done. The London Games didn't lose money. The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics made a profit, and in fact, that profit has been put to wonderful use.\\n\\nThe 1984 Games generated a $225 million surplus, which has been used to support American Olympic efforts and local youth sports organizations over the past three decades, according to The Los Angeles Times.\\n\\nAt the end of last year, Paris and Los Angeles were chosen to host the Olympic Games in 2024 and 2028. The International Olympic Committee says the cities were picked because of their plans to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.\\n\\nGrant-Long says choosing those cities is part of the IOC's goal to figure out what is a sustainable path forward, and it's either a single site, a set of permanent sites, or really recalibrating the games around a much more modest idea."}
{"original": "Unpacking What The American Israel Public Affairs Committee Does\\n\\nWhen Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee with anti-Semitic stereotypes, she also may have inflated AIPAC's clout.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nWhen Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted a few days ago about the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, she repeated what are viewed as anti-Semitic characterizations of the powerful lobbying group - that the group's money drives U.S. policy towards Israel. But as NPR's Peter Overby reports, as with all money in politics, it's a complicated picture.\\n\\nPETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Omar tweeted that it's, quote, all about the Benjamins. And by that, she meant AIPAC. The PAC in AIPAC, though, doesn't stand for political action committee. It's public affairs committee. Josh Block is head of The Israel Project and is a former AIPAC staffer.\\n\\nJOSH BLOCK: It's a lobby that represents Americans who support the U.S.-Israel alliance. It itself, as an organization, does not make endorsements. It doesn't contribute to campaigns. It doesn't contribute to candidates - none of those things. In fact, it doesn't even have a PAC.\\n\\nOVERBY: AIPAC has more than 100,000 members and the biggest lobbying budget among pro-Israel groups - $3 1/2 million last year. Among its activities, it regularly flies lawmakers to Israel. Members of AIPAC definitely make political contributions, Block said, but AIPAC wants to focus on something more than that.\\n\\nBLOCK: That's the thing about what it is that makes AIPAC so special, which is it's the relationships that exist - real ones between actual constituents, Jews and non-Jews and members of Congress who understand the value of the U.S.-Israel alliance.\\n\\nOVERBY: AIPAC has always strongly backed the Israeli government, but things have changed. These days, there are more liberal Jewish groups, most notably J Street, which takes a more critical view of Israel's foreign policy. Ben Shnider is senior adviser to J Street PAC.\\n\\nBEN SHNIDER: The perception has long been that - the consensus was that members of Congress and that elected leaders should take a hard right, Israel-is-always-right approach to these issues.\\n\\nOVERBY: But then came the rift over the status of Palestine.\\n\\nSHNIDER: If you poll the Jewish community, which J Street has done every election night since our founding, you'll see that, in fact, a majority of American Jews support pushing for a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.\\n\\nOVERBY: And yet, another change - the role of political money. AIPAC has a small constellation of political action committees around it, but data from the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the pro-Israel groups have relatively small budgets in this era of super PACs and dark money. So while billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a strong backer of the Israeli government, spent more than $100 million of his own money in the midterm elections, just two pro-Israel groups listed by the center broke the $1 million mark.

Americans are advised to stay home. Many states have made that advice mandatory. Florida's governor acted much later than most, but finally issued a stay-at-home order yesterday. Still, a White House projection of 100,000 dead or more, even with perfect compliance, prompts talk of better guidelines or better testing.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR's Allison Aubrey is here to talk through the options. Allison, good morning.\\n\\nALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And she's talking to us from home, we should note.\\n\\nAUBREY: That's right.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Let's remember, Allison, the United States fell disastrously behind on testing. What's happening now?\\n\\nAUBREY: Well, this week, a new 15-minute test is being rolled out. It runs on a device that some doctors already have in their offices to do, say, a quick strep test or flu test. So if this goes smoothly, this could really speed up diagnostic testing. But there's also a different kind of test, an antibody test. And that's to determine who's been exposed or infected.\\n\\nDr. Deborah Birx played this up during the White House briefing last night. She says she's been in touch with a bunch of universities, asking them to develop these tests quickly.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nDEBORAH BIRX: So in a day or two after development, they could screen their entire hospital. I think that would be very reassuring to the health care workers who have been on the front line.\\n\\nAUBREY: And that's because the way this test works is it doesn't always pick up early viral infection, but it can tell if someone has ever had the virus, even if they were maybe asymptomatic. So this is important because if you've already had the virus, as Birx points out, you're likely to have some immunity.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yeah, and maybe face a little less risk. Do doctors better understand who's most at risk?\\n\\nAUBREY: Well, so far, the CDC has found that 78% of people hospitalized in the ICU with COVID in the U.S. had at least one chronic or underlying condition. Some of these are very common. A third had diabetes. Thirty percent had heart disease. Twenty-one percent had chronic lung disease, which includes asthma and COPD. So people with these conditions are most at risk. But we should point out, this is unpredictable. The CDC has also found in their early snapshot that 20% of patients hospitalized were under the age of 44.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Wow. So the key here is to avoid getting the virus in the first place, no matter who you are. And is there anything that people can do beyond the social distancing advice we've heard about and just washing your hands?\\n\\nAUBREY: Well, you could cover your face when you go out in public. The CDC says it's reviewing its face mask policy. And that's because a lot of people who get the virus are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms or pre-symptomatic. So maybe wearing a mask will help stop people from unknowingly spread the virus. The current policy is that only sick people or those caring for a sick person need to wear a mask.\\n\\nBut some pretty high-profile folks have challenged this. The former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has said, if we all wear masks when we go out, it could be beneficial. He points to places where masks are used widely, such as Hong Kong and South Korea. And these places are thought to have done well in controlling the epidemic.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Although, Allison, I've heard so much about a shortage of the proper kind of masks that work. If somebody handed me a mask, I'd want to hand it right off to a medical professional.\\n\\nAUBREY: That's right. And that's why this is a very difficult question. As you point out, there definitely are shortages. And that's why some people are making their own masks. The president is even suggesting that people wear a scarf over their face. Now, it's not clear how much protection this offers. So when it comes to how to cover your face or making your own mask, Scott Gottlieb says the CDC should provide guidance on the proper way to do this, the best way.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Just so we're clear, no evidence a scarf helps me?\\n\\nAUBREY: Not a published study to show that, no.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Allison, thanks so much.\\n\\nAUBREY: Thank you.\\n\\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Allison Aubrey.\\n\\nNow let's focus on the latest big state that has told residents to stay at home.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah. Florida's governor is telling residents to do exactly that, stay in their homes except for essential activities. Ron DeSantis held off on that step until yesterday as the state reached a total of 7,000 cases.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR's Greg Allen is in Miami. Greg, good morning.\\n\\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Why did Florida's governor wait so long?\\n\\nALLEN: Well, for more than a week, Governor DeSantis has been saying, you know, Florida is a very big state. And there are some counties here that still have few, if any cases in the central and northern part of the state. Most cases are in the south part of Florida. Miami-Dade and Broward counties have the majority of them. And those and other populist counties around the state have imposed stay-at-home orders for some time. DeSantis felt it didn't make sense to order a shutdown in these rural counties that are far from the population centers.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Although, apparently, now he thinks it does make sense.\\n\\nALLEN: Well, there's been mounting criticism for weeks of his reluctance to issue the order. And it was led by Democrats in Florida who thought the state should follow the lead of states like California and New York, which nearly two weeks ago imposed stay-at-home orders. And other states have followed suit. Public health experts also joined in the call.\\n\\nThis week, the White House task force cited modeling done by a University of Washington epidemiologist which showed that deaths and the health care crisis will be even worse if Florida doesn't order a lockdown. So then DeSantis says he talked to members of the White House task force and President Trump and decided to issue the order. He said he made the decision after President Trump extended for 30 days the White House social distancing guidelines.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nRON DESANTIS: I think that's a signal from the president that, look, this is what we're going to be fighting for a month. There's not going to be any kind of return to normalcy. That's not going to happen.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, I guess we should note, fighting for a month is optimistic at best compared to what other experts are saying. The governor is doing something else or declining to do something involving cruise ships. What's going on?\\n\\nALLEN: Well, we have these two cruise ships, the Zaandam and the Rotterdam, that are set to arrive later today. At least four people have died on one of the ships. And some 200 people have become sick at some point. Many countries have declined to allow the people to disembark. And so President Trump yesterday encouraged DeSantis to allow the passengers to disembark here.\\n\\nBut as DeSantis has said, this is a decision that's not going to be made by him but by officials in Broward County working with the CDC, the Coast Guard and border and customs control. And they're working on agreement that will allow healthy passengers to disembark and go home. But at the same time, they want assurances that the sick can be treated by the cruise line company and not take up beds in local hospitals. Here's what Governor DeSantis had to say about it yesterday.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nDESANTIS: My concern is simply that, you know, we have worked so hard to make sure we have adequate hospital space in the event of a COVID-19 surge that we wouldn't want, you know, those valuable beds to be taken because of the cruise ship.\\n\\nALLEN: The company said yesterday that less than 10 people, in its words, need hospitalization. A local hospital has agreed to accept them. DeSantis said yesterday on Fox News that he thought that would work. The ships will be entering Florida waters this afternoon.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR's Greg Allen with the latest from Florida. Greg, thanks so much.\\n\\nALLEN: You're welcome.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And this next story reminds us how much the world has changed in a few weeks.\\n\\nMARTIN: Right. Super Tuesday was just a month ago. The presidential campaign seemed like the biggest story of 2020. Some campaigning is still happening in different ways. For Vice President Joe Biden, that means talking to supporters on a new podcast.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: We can't hold rallies anymore. But we're not gathering in large public spaces. We're living in the new normal. But I want you to know that I'm with you. I'm on your side. And we're going to get through this together as a country. And...\\n\\nMARTIN: Weeks ago, President Trump was still holding campaign rallies.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is reporting on how the campaign has changed. Mara, good morning.\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK. The president is not holding rallies anymore. But he is on TV almost every day.\\n\\nLIASSON: Yes. He's on TV every day. He's instituted White House briefings that had stopped. It's a lot less noisy to talk to the press inside than out on the south lawn in front of the helicopters. But, you know, the White House press corps has been clamoring for regular press briefings and now they have them. And the president has recognized the power of these briefings because people are holed up in their homes in front of the television, desperate for information about the virus. And most of the briefings have been about the virus.\\n\\nBut yesterday, he started using them as a way to talk about other things, other issues. Yesterday, he talked about cracking down on narco-trafficking from Venezuela. It's an issue that's important to many of his voters in Florida, an important battleground state. And, look, no president wants to preside over hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of people unemployed. But for a president whose favorite metric is television ratings, how many eyeballs are watching him, this has been a huge opportunity. And he has boasted that the briefings have gotten Bachelor-finale-level ratings. It's like Monday Night Football. Yesterday he said, did you know I was No. 1 on Facebook?\\n\\nINSKEEP: Then there's the question of poll ratings.\\n\\nLIASSON: Yes. He's gotten a bump. In a crisis, people want their president to succeed. And we usually see a rally effect. He hasn't gotten as big a bump as the governors and other democratically elected leaders around the world. And right now, it looks like the higher marks that he's getting for handling the crisis are not translating into an equally higher overall job approval rating. He's still in that 43 to 49% range that he's been in since he got 46.1% of the vote in 2016.\\n\\nAnd we've got a long way to go, you know. The number of deaths is going to rise. The number of people unemployed is going to rise. And, you know, way back in the 1980s, Jimmy Carter also had sky high approval ratings at the beginning of the hostage crisis.\\n\\nINSKEEP: A bunch of Democratic primaries have been delayed, which has made it impossible for Joe Biden to, for example, wrap up the Democratic nomination. How is that affecting things?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, you're right. In a lot of ways, this campaign is frozen. Even though, if you turn on your TV in a battleground state, you will still see lots of attack ads against both Trump and Biden. But, yes, Biden is being deprived of oxygen. He's kind of stuck in his makeshift TV studio in his basement. Most people are interested in hearing from Democratic governors, like Andrew Cuomo, who are on the front lines of this pandemic. So it is harder for him to fundraise and unite the party.\\n\\nBut there's also an argument that, right now, whatever Biden might say doesn't matter that much. This part of the campaign is a referendum on Trump and his leadership in this crisis. It will become a binary choice, but later on in the fall. So the campaign is going to get shrunk into a narrower window of time. And maybe some voters are going to be happy about that.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Mara, thanks for the update, really appreciate it.\\n\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\n\\nINSKEEP: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "Union Representing 16,000 Border Agents Endorses Trump\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nThe union that represents 16,000 Border Patrol agents is throwing its weight behind Donald Trump. That is a first for the National Border Patrol Council, which has never endorsed a candidate in the primaries before. The union says it's doing so now because, quote, we need a person in the White House who doesn't fear the media, doesn't embrace political correctness and doesn't need the money. Well, the president of the Border Patrol Council is Brandon Judd. He told me he's been talking with Donald Trump, including about that wall Trump wants to build on the border with Mexico.\\n\\nBRANDON JUDD: I told him, look, we don't need a wall across the entire Southwest border. He asked me why. And I was able to explain to him why. And he was very receptive to those ideas of those individuals who know what it takes to secure the border. And right now Donald Trump is that person.\\n\\nKELLY: Let me follow up on this conversation you had with him. The centerpiece of Donald Trump's immigration policy is building a wall along the border with Mexico, which actually directly conflicts with what your union position is. Your union has called building walls a waste of taxpayer money.\\n\\nJUDD: In certain areas, I would - absolutely. But what we're talking about is when we build walls - if you look at where the fences are currently, we have our fences in urban areas. And we have to have those fences in those urban areas. But what we need is we need a double fence. A single fence - I can't control the south side of that fence. The smugglers control the south side of the fence. I can control the north side of the fence, but I can't control the south side.\\n\\nKELLY: So your sense from having spoken to him is that there is, perhaps, some flexibility in Donald Trump's policy about building this wall along the Mexican border?\\n\\nJUDD: There is. There absolutely is. Whether he completely and totally agrees with all of my ideas, that's - you know, that remains to be seen. But right now he is having that discussion. And no other candidate is having that discussion. And that's what we have to have.\\n\\nKELLY: And what did you make of Donald Trump, the man? Is there anything about his temperament or character that gives you pause?\\n\\nJUDD: He was very calm during our conversation. He was - he was very amicable. And I imagine that these are the types of conversations he's going to be - that he's going to be having behind closed doors.\\n\\nKELLY: Was this a pretty unanimous decision, Mr. Judd? Or were there - was there much debate within the union over whether to throw your weight behind Donald Trump?\\n\\nJUDD: There was a lot of debate. In fact, we looked at every single candidate that there was, including Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton. And one of the reasons why there's no way that as an organization we can support her is her stance is that we've done a good job of securing the border. But the men and women of the Border Patrol will tell you that that's not true. In fact, I would invite Ms. Clinton to come patrol the border with me to see just how unsecure the border is. I just don't think that she would - she would take that invitation.\\n\\nKELLY: Is your sense, having spoken to him, that Donald Trump fully has thought through his immigration policy? I ask because that is one frequent criticism that is made, is that he speaks without having fully prepared a policy in advance.\\n\\nJUDD: Well, what he's shown, his willingness to reach out - I'm going to absolutely have to say that he's given it a lot of thought. He was willing to reach out to the men and women of the Border Patrol to find out what he needs to do. And he's been willing to change what some of his preconceived notions might have been. And again, we need that in a candidate.\\n\\nKELLY: That's Brandon Judd. He is president of the National Border Patrol Council, which has just endorsed Donald Trump. Thanks so much.\\n\\nJUDD: Thank you. I appreciate your time.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "What U.S.-Iran Tensions Mean For The Middle East\\n\\nNPR's Scott Simon speaks with with Dalia Dassa Kaye of the Rand Corporation about the implications of Iran-U.S. tensions in the region, where relationships are complicated and, at times, volatile.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nLongstanding tensions between the U.S. and Iran reached a near boiling point after the U.S. assassinated Iran's Gen. Qassem Soleimani. How does this affect the region? Dalia Dassa Kaye joins us now. She's director of the Center For Middle East Public Policy at the RAND Corporation. She joins us from the studios of NPR West. Thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nDALIA DASSA KAYE: Thank you.\\n\\nSIMON: Let me ask you about the position of Iraq. The attack took place there. The U.S. has troops there in Iraq - has since the invasion in 2003. At the same time, Iran is their neighbor and has much influence - economic and even paramilitary units in the country. What does Iraq need from both the U.S. and Iran?\\n\\nKAYE: Well, I think Iraq is in a very difficult position. So from the Iranian side, there is no way for the Iraqis to completely remove Iranian influence. Many Iraqi leaders have very close relationships with Iran.\\n\\nAnd from the American side, I think this is where things are getting incredibly tricky. There's growing domestic pressure to force the United States out because it's creating a situation where Iraq is becoming a target for retaliation. On the other hand, it really needs the United States because it still faces a threat from the Islamic State. And so I think it's trying to manage all of these pressures at the same time.\\n\\nSIMON: What about the position of United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain? These are countries that have U.S. bases but also still have a relationship with Iran.\\n\\nKAYE: Yeah, that's true. Now, before the recent escalations that began really last summer with attacks on oil tankers and the most brazen attack, which was against Saudi Aramco, some took a much more hostile stance to the Iranians - the Saudis and Emiratis in particular. But what we've seen is there is unprecedented unity at the moment among Arab states wanting to see de-escalation, very concerned about the ramifications of this conflict and being targets as this situation continues to unfold.\\n\\nSIMON: How unsettled are a couple of countries that both happen to be longtime U.S. allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia?\\n\\nKAYE: Well, I think the Saudis are probably among those most concerned about the situation. They - it's not hypothetical for them. They did face a very, very serious attack against their major oil facility, and there was no response from the United States or others at that time.\\n\\nSo what we have seen is very interesting. There seems to be an incentive on the Saudi side and others to reach out to the Iranians in new mediation efforts. But I think of all the regional players, the Israelis are in best position to defend themselves should they be a target of retaliation. But, of course, the Iranians are signaling they don't distinguish between the United States and Israel, so I don't think there is a lot of complacency in the region that this is over.\\n\\nSIMON: How worrisome is the possibility of Iran developing any kind of nuclear capacity to other countries in the region?\\n\\nKAYE: Well, this is an ongoing concern and becoming a bigger concern since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement back in 2018. There's still inspectors in the country, which is good news, but we could be facing the prospect that the Iranians could develop a capacity. I don't think they're going to break out to...\\n\\nSIMON: Well, they haven't developed a weapon yet, right?\\n\\nKAYE: No, but it's certainly a worrying trendline. And I think a lot of Iran's regional neighbors are watching this closely, are very concerned about it. But they're also concerned about Iranian meddling in other ways beyond the nuclear - I think is the more concerning issue at the moment.\\n\\nSIMON: Do countries in the region see U.S. policy as coherent, clear?\\n\\nKAYE: Well, no, unfortunately. I think that's one of the biggest concerns and why the risk remains so high. The concern is, is there a possibility the United States or some in the U.S. administration is looking for ultimately a change in leadership? And if that's the perception, that could lead to even more dangerous Iranian behavior.\\n\\nSIMON: Dalia Dassa Kaye of the RAND Corporation, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nKAYE: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "How The Economic Effects Of Coronavirus Compare To Past Downturns\\n\\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, about the economic ramifications of the coronavirus and how it compares to past downturns.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nHow quickly will things turn around after the economic shock of the coronavirus? Jason Furman is a veteran of the last major economic crisis. He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration and helped design that administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. He now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and he joins us on the line this morning.\\n\\nThanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nJASON FURMAN: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And I also want to introduce NPR chief economic correspondent Scott Horsley, who's also with us this morning, and he'll be asking questions, too.\\n\\nHi, Scott.\\n\\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Jason Furman, former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder says the U.S. is already in a recession. Do you agree?\\n\\nFURMAN: I think that is very likely. The question is whether the economy peaked in February or March.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What is your reaction, then, to this weekend's two big moves by the government here in the United States? The White House is tapping natural disaster emergency powers to free up up to $50 billion to help respond to the coronavirus, and Nancy Pelosi struck a deal with the administration on sick leave, food assistance and more. What's your take?\\n\\nFURMAN: I think both of those are great steps. The natural disaster doesn't just unlock 50 billion; it unlocks a set of rules that will make it much easier to deal with this. The House bill, I think, is terrific in terms of free testing; more money for state Medicaid programs, which I think is really critical at a time like this when states will come under strain; and the paid leave, which is imperfect, but it's a compromise. It's a good start. So I think all of that is terrific, important, can't happen too quickly.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Jason, is part of the tension here that the very things that we need to do - that public health officials say we need to do to flatten this curve and avoid overwhelming the health care system are the things that are going to be economically painful? Nike just announced it's closing its stores in the U.S. temporarily. Our barber friend there might see fewer customers. How do we do what we need to do from a public health standpoint and, at the same time, try to minimize the economic pain?\\n\\nFURMAN: Yeah. Look, Scott. The public health measures are going to hurt the economy quite a lot in the short run, and that's completely appropriate. That's completely appropriate for our health. It's also appropriate for our economy in the medium and long run because it will help end this more quickly. So I'm all for that.\\n\\nOur economic policy, though, should be aiming to cushion the blow as much as possible. I don't - wouldn't go out and suggest that we hurt the economy for the sake of hurting the economy just to slow the spread of the virus. So we want to get relief to people. We want to get cash to small businesses to help them get through this. And we also need to be in a place where we're - want the economy to rebound as quickly as possible after this because the longer it goes on, the more people lose their jobs, the worse shape balance sheets are in for businesses. And you don't snap back very quickly when you're in a situation like that.\\n\\nSo I think public health - definitely. Don't worry about the economy right now. Do what you need to do. Economic policy should still be doing what it can to mute the impact as much as possible.\\n\\nHORSLEY: And we've heard a lot about trying to roll out more testing for the coronavirus. Is that important from an economic standpoint, as well as, obviously, just to guide the health care response?\\n\\nFURMAN: Yeah. I mean, the most important economic policy right now is to reduce the spread of this virus and to spread it out so that it's not overwhelming our hospital systems. Testing has been a really important part of that in countries like South Korea that have done a much better job than the United States have. So I'm glad that cost for individuals won't be an obstacle to testing. You need the actual tests, though. And that seems to be making some progress, but still way behind where we should be.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The congressional aid package was really the product of negotiations between Speaker Pelosi and her House Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. You've called for just mailing checks to people. Can you explain why you think that's a good idea and maybe what other measures should be taken?\\n\\nFURMAN: Yeah. I think we should be doing four types of things - number one, anything we need to do on the health side. This bill has testing. I think we should be doing more on hospital construction, ventilators, tents, respirators and the like. Number two, all the targeted assistance to the people that we can identify that have been hurt - that's what's in the House bill - things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance and especially leave.\\n\\nSteps one and two, though, aren't large enough, and they don't reach a number of people who are going to be affected, which is almost all of us. So that's why step three should be broad-based assistance. I've proposed a check of a thousand dollars per adult, $500 per child.\\n\\nThere's a lot of different ways to do it. You could phase it out for higher incomes. That would get hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy. For some people, that would enable them not to work. So that's not necessarily for them about increasing economic growth. It's about public health. For others, it would let them continue to pay the rent. And for still others, it would put them in a better position to spend after all of this is over. So that's the third step.\\n\\nThe fourth thing is something, especially on the lending side, to help businesses with the huge liquidity crunch that so many of them are going to be going through.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Jason, can I ask about what this is doing in the financial markets - not only the wild swings in the stock market, but also the credit markets? I want to play something your Kennedy School colleague Megan Greene said.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nMEGAN GREENE: This has gone from being a supply-side shock, where the worry was that, you know, American companies wouldn't be able to get parts to finish their products to sell them to clients, to now being a demand-side shock, where everybody's working from home. And so you don't have people out buying stuff - to finally this week being a financial shock.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Can you explain what that means by financial shock and how that could actually make things even worse in the real economy?\\n\\nFURMAN: Sure. What most people are paying attention to is the ups and downs of the stock market. And that's important, but the stock market can actually go down a lot without that causing a decent recession. I'm not saying that's good. I'm not saying I want that.\\n\\nThe thing where you really get worried is if the lifeblood of the economy, the lending, starts to dry up. And one of the worrying things that happened this past week is that while the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and the interest rates on Treasury bonds, which were very safe, were very low, interest rates on a lot of what matters for the economy, like home mortgages, actually went up. And that is because investors were just nervous about liquidity in some of those other markets.\\n\\nWhat I'd like to see and expect to see this week from - coming week from the Fed is that they're going to do something not just to lower the headline interest rate but to start directly buying and getting involved in markets to bring down interest rates that people are actually borrowing at, like their mortgage rates, the rates businesses borrow at.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Jason Furman, just quickly - we have a few seconds left. How long do you think this is going to last?\\n\\nFURMAN: I have no idea, but I'm encouraged by the increasingly dramatic steps that we're taking as a country. I think those are great news for all of us.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Jason Furman. He was the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Obama administration.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nFURMAN: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump Bans U.S. Funding For Groups That 'Promote' Abortion Overseas\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images\\n\\nIt's President Donald Trump's first official act on the abortion issue. On Monday, the new president signed a presidential memorandum reinstating the Mexico City policy — barring U.S. aid from any group that provides or promotes abortion overseas. The policy dates to 1984, when Ronald Reagan unveiled it at a United Nations Conference in Mexico City. The Trump version is even broader than the incarnations that previous Republican presidents have adopted.\\n\\nWhat does this mean in practice? To help make sense of it we've put together an FAQ.\\n\\nWhat were the rules on the U.S. funding of international abortion before Trump's executive action?\\n\\nU.S. law has actually long prohibited the use of U.S. aid dollars to directly pay for abortions overseas.\\n\\nSpecifically, in 1973 — in reaction to the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion — Congress adopted the so-called Helms Amendment to the law governing U.S. aid. That provision states that no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\\n\\nA foreign government or aid group that gets U.S. funding can still provide abortions overseas. But to do so it would have to use money from non-U.S.-government sources.\\n\\nSo what, exactly, is the Mexico City policy?\\n\\nThe policy, as first implemented by Reagan, went further than the Helms Amendment in two key ways:\\n\\nFirst, it holds that if a group wants U.S. funding it must promise not to use monies even from other sources to provide abortions.\\n\\nSecond, the group must also agree not to actively promote abortion. In practice this has covered not just advocating for laws in favor of abortion rights but informational activities such as providing patients with referrals, counseling or information about the procedure.\\n\\nIn contrast to the Helms Amendment, the Mexico City policy does not apply to foreign governments, only to nongovernmental groups that work overseas. So a government-sponsored medical center could be eligible for U.S. funding even if it were to provide or actively promote abortion.\\n\\nSince Reagan introduced the policy, every time the U.S. presidency has changed party hands, the incoming leader has reversed his predecessor's position.\\n\\nIn what way is President Trump's version of the policy possibly more expansive?\\n\\nThe original version was specifically limited to family planning aid disbursed by USAID. Trump's memorandum calls for extending the rules to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.\\n\\nHow much aid money is at stake?\\n\\nAs of this writing, the full implications are not clear. The U.S. spends more than $10 billion annually on global health — including $607.5 million specifically on reproductive health. And it remains to be seen how much of that goes to groups that currently provide or promote abortion as defined by the policy — and that would opt to give up U.S. aid dollars rather than falling in line.\\n\\nBut opponents of the policy are already warning that many groups will be forced to give up their funding. Adrienne Lee, a spokeswoman for abortion rights advocacy group PAI, says there would be devastating consequences for the impoverished women for whom these groups provide a whole range of health services, including many unrelated to abortion, such as access to contraception.\\n\\nIf the consequences to the people they serve are so severe, why wouldn't these groups just agree to the terms of the policy and keep their funding?\\n\\nHere's what Allison Marshall, director of advocacy for International Planned Parenthood, one of the largest recipients of U.S. reproductive health aid, has told NPR. She says that even though the group stands to lose about $100 million over a two- to three-year period, complying with the policy would compromise the care it can offer.\\n\\nWe'd have to stop telling women and girls when they came into our clinic what their options are, she says. And we can't do that.\\n\\nWhat do supporters of the policy say?\\n\\nAnti-abortion groups like the Family Research Council and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argue that aid organizations that are willing to comply with the policy will spring up to fill any gaps that result. And they say the policy is needed to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not supporting abortions overseas. Arina Grossu of the Family Research Council says, There's a fungibility factor. The only way to protect taxpayer money from going for abortion is by reinstating the Mexico City policy."}
{"original": "What Happens To People's Legal Cases As Coronavirus Shuts Down Courts?\\n\\nNPR's Renee Montagne speaks to former public defender Premal Dharia about what happens to the thousands of cases awaiting legal decisions as district and state courts are forced to shut.\\n\\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\\n\\nThe coronavirus is forcing district and state courts to shut down around the country. Thousands of cases will be in limbo, and there is growing concern about people awaiting legal decisions sitting in jail cells. Joining me now in the studio is Premal Dharia. She is a former public defender and now the director of the Defender Impact Initiative. Welcome.\\n\\nPREMAL DHARIA: Thank you.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: You know, people have raised concerns about how COVID-19 might affect the prison population. We've been hearing a bit of that. But jails are a little bit different, aren't they?\\n\\nDHARIA: They are, yes. Generally speaking, they are places that people who have not yet been convicted of any offense go and where people who are serving short sentences or who are detained on so-called technical violations of probation or parole go. The turnover rate is enormous and very different than that of prisons.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: And so does that already raise a red flag about how vulnerable those who are locked up in jails might be to something like the coronavirus?\\n\\nDHARIA: Absolutely. It's a huge concern. We have more than 3,000 jails around the country. Having the constant churn of people coming in and out just exacerbates the problem and exposes everybody on the outside and on the inside. In Florida alone, 2,000 people are admitted and released in county jails per day, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: What about medical attention? Again, a prison, which may have lots of long-term people in there - presumably, there are doctors available. What about a jail, though?\\n\\nDHARIA: Because a lot of jails are in rural and/or poor places, there are inherently resource issues in lots of them. Medical treatment and resources are not equipped to handle - certainly not pandemics of this magnitude. We don't have epidemiologists or infectious disease experts.\\n\\nThere are often also understaffing issues so that when people who are in jails request medical attention, it might not happen right away. Statistics and studies show that people who have preexisting or underlying conditions that are very vulnerable to COVID-19 - heart conditions or heart disease, asthma, diabetes - are disproportionately represented in jails.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, are there any lessons from history? What methods did, say, jails use to contain past outbreaks like the H1N1 swine flu? It was just a few years ago.\\n\\nDHARIA: Historically, jails around the country - and prisons, as well - have engaged in this sort of attempt at containment by creating isolation or segregation or locking down their facilities. This is not going to be effective. Creating solitary confinement conditions for people, particularly people who are legally not permitted to be punished...\\n\\nMONTAGNE: They have not been convicted...\\n\\nDHARIA: Correct.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: ...Of anything yet.\\n\\nDHARIA: Correct. But...\\n\\nMONTAGNE: They just, say, couldn't make bail.\\n\\nDHARIA: Correct. I think this is going to lead to a lot of frustration on the parts of people who need and deserve to have their cases heard. We are seeing courts starting to shut down already. We're seeing jurors not being called in. We're certainly seeing lawyers teleworking.\\n\\nAnd I think what would be much more effective at keeping the most people safe is releasing as many people as possible from incarceration. Prosecutors can start to decline seeking detention on the front end. Courts can decline to detain people or can release people. Sheriffs and other people overseeing jails can start to advocate for the release of the people inside facilities. Parole commissions and governors can start to release people as well. A lot of people are held on parole or probation violations or could be granted early release through other means.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: That's Premal Dharia. She's a former public defender and now director of the Defender Impact Initiative. Thank you for joining us in our studio.\\n\\nDHARIA: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "What Border Patrol Agents Think About Immigration Policy\\n\\nThe U.S. border with Mexico is a difficult place to patrol. Chris Cabrera, spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council, speaks with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about what a wall would mean.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nWith immigration discussions foundering on Capitol Hill, we wondered what the people on the frontlines of implementing those policies think. Chris Cabrera is a spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents the nation's almost 20,000 border patrol agents. He joins us on the line from his office in McAllen, Texas, on the border. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nCHRIS CABRERA: Thank you.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So as Congress and the president negotiate over immigration policy, what do you and your colleagues want them to know?\\n\\nCABRERA: Our biggest concern is getting clear marching orders and, you know, getting this wall built in the strategic locations and just going forward and getting it done.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. I was on the border, and I talked to the head of the Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley. And he said that a literal wall is only needed in a very few places and that, actually, what is needed is more of a technological wall - cameras, infrared technology, drones.\\n\\nCABRERA: You have the need for a physical barrier. You have the need for technology with the infrared, with, you know, the ground sensors and cameras. And you have the personnel aspect of it, as well. The wall and the technology won't do you any good unless you have the manpower to actually physically apprehend somebody.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But the president talks about this sort of wall from sea to shining sea.\\n\\nCABRERA: Yeah. You know, I honestly - I don't think that's going to work. I mean, if you look at Big Bend, you'll have areas that are a 30-foot cliff down to the Rio Grande. And to put another 30-foot section on top of that - it seems kind of redundant.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What about Border Patrol agents? Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, of which you belong, complained just this past week on Capitol Hill that the president has only proposed and Congress is slated on funding 500 new agents this year. At this rate, the agents we hire this year will be halfway to retirement before we meet the goal in 2028. Are you satisfied with the amount of support you're getting for hiring more agents?\\n\\nCABRERA: Well, you know, one of the problems we're having is not necessarily hiring more agents - is retaining the agents we do have. That is one of our biggest problems right now. You know, we have to pay our agents competitively. If not, they'll go to other agencies, which we've been seeing recently.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The National Border Patrol Council supported President Donald Trump for president when he was a candidate. How are they feeling now in terms of the support that they've gotten from this administration?\\n\\nCABRERA: Our support is still there 100 percent. It hasn't wavered.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But how are you feeling that the president is supporting you?\\n\\nCABRERA: I think he is supporting us. I haven't seen anything to show that he's not supporting us. Morale is at the highest point since I've been in. So that's a good thing.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: There has been a lot of criticism, though, of some of the policies of not only ICE but the Border Patrol agents. We've seen cases of what people feel are sort of egregious actions against undocumented people. There was a case last fall of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy. She had been brought over the border illegally when she was 3 months old. And then she was detained by immigration authorities in Texas. Can you speak to that? I mean, there is a concern that these expanded powers are being abused.\\n\\nCABRERA: She did come through a border checkpoint. She was in a private car. So everybody that comes to that checkpoint has to be inspected. Now, had they called ahead, or she had some documentation in order, they could've expedited the process. But that wasn't done.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But there is a broader concern. I'm sure you understand that there is a sense that, possibly, people are being targeted, and there is a climate of fear among the immigrant community.\\n\\nCABRERA: You know, I understand your concern, but I don't believe. I don't see it. The reality in which I live in down here on the border is I see border patrol agents that risk their lives to jump into a river to save someone who's drowning. I see agents that'll give their last bottle of water to someone we apprehend. You know, I know we like to get painted as a bunch of thugs walking the border, but that can be - couldn't be farther from the truth. You know, and if you come into the country illegally - the first act you did in this country was illegal - and you're worried about somebody enforcing the law because you're here illegally, I mean, who's in the right, and who's in the wrong?\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Chris Cabrera of the National Border Patrol Council, thanks for speaking with us.\\n\\nCABRERA: All right. Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Biden Suspends Deportations, Stops 'Remain In Mexico' Policy\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Ratje/AFP via Getty Images Paul Ratje/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nThe newly inaugurated Biden administration wasted no time in taking two major steps to dismantle much-criticized Trump-era immigration policies in its first day in office.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced that starting Thursday, it would pause deportations for certain noncitizens in the United States for 100 days and would stop new enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols policy, also known as the remain in Mexico program.\\n\\nActing Department of Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske said the U.S. faces significant operational challenges at the southwest border as it is confronting the most serious global public health crisis in a century.\\n\\nPausing some enforcement measures gives the agency breathing room as the DHS plans to fully review current programs and U.S. immigration policies, Pekoske said in a memo issued late Wednesday.\\n\\nPekoske's memo directed DHS sub-agencies Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to review and reset enforcement policies and set interim policies for civil enforcement while the Department develops its final priorities.\\n\\nThe department aims to focus its resources where they are most needed, Pekoske said. In light of the serious challenges at the southern border, DHS must surge resources to the area to ensure safe, legal and orderly immigrant processing.\\n\\nRemain in Mexico ends\\n\\nThe Trump administration's controversial remain in Mexico policy requiring asylum-seekers trying to enter the U.S. from the southern border to wait in Mexico for American court hearings will be suspended.\\n\\nThe program has led to roughly 60,000 migrants getting sent back across the border since MPP was first implemented in January 2019. Tens of thousands of people are still stuck in Mexico, awaiting their court hearings, and living in unsanitary and potentially dangerous situations. The policy has placed enormous strain on Mexico, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThousands more migrants from Latin America have pushed their way toward Mexico in recent days. Some have told journalists that they are making their way north because they expect it to be easier to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Others say the economic situation and violence in Honduras has made remaining there untenable. The increase in migrants, however, promises even more stress on Mexico and the U.S. immigration system.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Guatemalan security forces confronted a caravan of migrants from Honduras. Guatemalan security forces in the country's southwest attempted to block thousands of Honduran migrants from heading north toward Mexico and the U.S. border. Some migrants have been able to skirt security forces by moving off the main roads, according to officials in Guatemala. Mexico, however, has implemented its own strict border security forces, making crossing into the country difficult for many travelers.\\n\\nGuillermo Díaz, Guatemala's top immigration official, said at least 7,000 to 8,000 Hondurans had crossed into Guatemala in an irregular manner.\\n\\nLegalization path limited\\n\\nKaren Tumlin, founder of the Justice Action Center, an organization providing legal aid to immigrants, called the step to end MPP huge.\\n\\nTumlin wrote on Twitter, It confirms the Biden-Harris commitment to restoring dignity to our asylum system. Here's to the next, critical steps to remedy the inhumane impacts of this shameful program.\\n\\nHowever, immigration hard-liners such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform are already set to oppose the Biden administration's immigration plan.\\n\\nWe hope fervently that when it comes to dealing with immigration, the new administration will seek to find common sense policies that not only serve to enhance the economic recovery from COVID, but provide lasting security and prosperity for the country, Dan Stein, president of Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower levels of immigration, said a day before Biden's inauguration. President Biden must protect American jobs and not capitulate to special interests pushing radical policies that put Americans last.\\n\\nDuring the moratorium on MPP, current COVID-19 nonessential travel restrictions — both at the border and in the region — remain in place. But it is unclear what will happen to migrants already enrolled in MPP.\\n\\nThe DHS said, All current MPP participants should remain where they are, pending further official information from U.S. government officials.\\n\\nBiden's administration is also moving forward on large scale changes to U.S. immigration policy. He sent a new immigration bill to Congress on Wednesday.\\n\\nHowever, under the proposed changes, immigrants currently outside the U.S. — likely those still awaiting their court hearings in Mexico and the migrants on their way from Honduras and Guatemala — will not be eligible for legal status."}
{"original": "From 'Dropout Crisis' To Record High, Dissecting The Graduation Rate\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\\n\\nIn his State of the Union address in January, President Obama had some sure-fire applause lines: More of our kids are graduating than ever before and Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.\\n\\nWhich raised some interesting questions: Is that really true? and Why? and How do we know? and So what?\\n\\nA seed was planted that grew into our project this week examining that number. Our reporting shows many of the individual stories behind a single statistic: 81 percent, the current U.S. graduation rate.\\n\\nBut in the course of pulling this project together, our team fell into a rabbit hole over something that doesn't often get attention: the origin of the statistic itself. It turns out to be a fascinating story, and not just for data wonks. It's a story of collaboration across the political aisle, heroic efforts and millions of dollars spent by state governments, and dogged researchers uncovering new insights that arguably changed the lives of tens of thousands of young people.\\n\\nMany individuals worked hard, and worked together, to make the nation do a better job counting high school graduates. The effort had complex — sometimes contradictory — results.\\n\\nThe ABCs And No Child Left Behind\\n\\nWhen we say 81 percent is an all-time high, let's put that in context for a moment.\\n\\nFor most of American history, high school was a rare achievement — one, by the way, that qualified you for a white-collar job.\\n\\nEstimates vary depending on the method used, but generally speaking, the graduation rate didn't exceed 50 percent of the population until 1940. It peaked at the end of the 1960s, but continued to undulate, hitting the doldrums between 1995 and 1999. Historically, racial and ethnic minorities trailed behind.\\n\\nWhile not quite a historic low, the dropout crisis was getting plenty of attention in 2002. That was the year of the No Child Left Behind Act, when the federal government got involved. The law required states to make measurable progress on high school graduation rates or face sanctions such as a loss of funds for poor students.\\n\\nAnd it wasn't just a matter of legislation. New research was influencing the public discussion, creating a sense of urgency around high school completion.\\n\\nElaine Allensworth at the University of Chicago published work identifying what was later called the early warning ABCs: Attendance, Behavior and Course Performance, which reliably predict graduation by freshman year.\\n\\nRobert Balfanz and Nettie Legters of Johns Hopkins University singled out the nation's dropout factories. At almost 1,000 high schools nationwide, they said, your chance of graduating was no more than 50-50.\\n\\nOn the economics front, We knew that 63 percent of jobs in the next decade would require some postsecondary education, says Sunny Deye, who works on education policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. There was an understanding that the way we were preparing kids for the 21st century economy needed to change. We had to shift the paradigm from allowing some kids to drop out to recognizing that a high school diploma was now the bar.\\n\\nSo the game was on. States had a legislative imperative to raise graduation rates; they knew where to target intervention (early on, and at failing schools); and they knew they would feel it economically if they didn't.\\n\\nBut there was a problem. The early 2000s were a dark time for state education statistics. States could report high school graduation rates any old way they pleased, and many did. Just to take one example, at the end of the 20th century, North Carolina was reporting a four-year high school graduation rate in the high 90s, says Daria Hall at the nonprofit policy center The Education Trust. They accomplished that, she says, by comparing the number of graduates who earned their diploma in four years, to the total of graduates, including those who took five or six years to graduate. Did you catch that? Their tally included no dropouts at all!\\n\\nMeanwhile, think tanks and federal agencies had competing information. The Census Bureau asks people about their level of education, for example.\\n\\nBut what was missing was a single, clear, comparable and accurate measure of graduation rates.\\n\\nThen something unusual happened in the world of public policy: action.\\n\\nIn 2005, the National Governor's Association convened a task force on state high school graduation data.\\n\\nDid you fall asleep in the middle of that sentence?\\n\\nWell, let's hear from a member of the task force: Legters, co-author of the dropout factories research:\\n\\nIt was a very heady time, she recalls. We felt that we were getting a lot done. It was a real turning point. There were so many different organizations coming together at the table, asking, how we could have gotten this so wrong in the past? And, what could we do to remedy it?\\n\\nThis was a bipartisan issue, with something for everyone, echoes Deye, another member of the task force. The dropout problem disproportionately affects communities of color and low-income communities. It was becoming a workforce issue; we were hearing from employers and the military. It was a state budget issue for social services and criminal justice systems.\\n\\nSo, the task force included representatives of the American Federation of Teachers and the Business Roundtable, officials from the administrations of governors including Republicans Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Democrat Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, along with many of the top-level researchers on the issue.\\n\\nThe mission, says Hall, also a member of the task force, was simple: Let's get together and figure it out. What is it going to take to get the data where we need it to be? (The project was underwritten by the Gates Foundation, which also funds coverage at NPR including of education.)\\n\\nACGR!\\n\\nThe task force recommended that states immediately adopt a single measurement called the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate — ACGR, as it's affectionately known. And the gears of state legislatures and education agencies started moving to put the ACGR into practice.\\n\\nYou've come this far. I know you want to get into the weeds with us. So let's break down the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate, shall we?\\n\\nCohort means you follow a single group of students through a single high school, from ninth grade through graduation. So this number captures everyone who drops out between freshman year and senior year.\\n\\nThat, by the way, wasn't easy in the age of paper records and attendance rolls kept in metal filing cabinets. It was only in the 2000s that most states acquired the technology to track individual students. The federal Race to the Top initiative in 2009 provided states with incentives to put tracking systems into place.\\n\\nBut simply comparing the number of ninth-graders to the number of diplomas awarded four years later would be misleading. Over those four years, some students will transfer in; others will transfer out to a different school, move out of state or even die. So the number has to be adjusted to account for those students. Voila: the ADJUSTED COHORT graduation rate.\\n\\n(There are other potential complications: GEDs, fifth-year graduates, special education and alternative diplomas. But we'll get to those later).\\n\\nMoving over to the ACGR method, and putting tracking systems in place, was going to be hard work, the task force knew.\\n\\nStates have spent millions on this, says Russell Rumberger, a dropout expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It's a pretty major undertaking. We took years to get our system going in California.\\n\\nAt least now states had their marching orders. Crunch the numbers, 'fess up and start making the picture better.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nAs we've been exploring all this week, states have taken a variety of paths, sometimes all at the same time. But what a lot of them come down to is a balance between raising academic standards and broadening access.\\n\\nWhat's Next?\\n\\nRecall that the 81 percent graduation rate, while a recent high, has shifted dramatically. Despite all the action that's been taken recently toward this goal, we have to keep in mind the possibility that broader social forces are playing a larger role than policy initiatives in influencing the percentage who graduate.\\n\\nA major report released earlier this spring argued that the U.S. is on track to achieve a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020. But it will take decades to know whether the students graduating from high school today will reap the same kind of lifetime benefits that their predecessors did from those diplomas.\\n\\nGraduation rates make for good headlines and applause lines, but they can't capture that kind of nuance."}
{"original": "Democratic Sen. Doug Jones Endorses Former Vice President Joe Biden\\n\\nNPR's David Greene talks to Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, one of 14 states voting on Super Tuesday, about why he thinks a ticket with Bernie Sanders at the helm could hurt his own reelection bid.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nWe turn now to Alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. That suggests that it is Joe Biden's to lose. David Greene talked with Alabama's Democratic senator, Doug Jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, BYLINE: So why is Joe Biden your pick?\\n\\nDOUG JONES: Well, I've known Joe for a long time - I mean, 40 years. I first met him as a law student here in Birmingham about - gosh, it was in I think 1978. And I've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. He's the kind of leader that I think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? I mean, for one, there was this story that Biden told about being arrested in South Africa on his way to see Nelson Mandela. It was largely disproven. Finally, Biden is saying, OK, I wasn't arrested. I was actually just held up at an airport. Can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?\\n\\nJONES: Well, you know, I can't speak for other voters. I think people that know Joe for a long time are looking at his record. They're not looking at things like that, especially when we've got folks in the White House, in the administration today, who have no compunction whatsoever about saying things that are either blown out of proportion, hyper hyped or either just outright false. So I think...\\n\\nGREENE: But does that make it - I'm sorry to interrupt. Does that make it OK for Joe Biden to say something that's not true?\\n\\nJONES: Well, I don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. Whether it's OK or not I don't think is going to be the issue. The issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. They're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. And I think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of South Carolina - they know Joe Biden. They know his fallacies. They know his positives. And that's why the people of South Carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why I think he's going to do very well on Super Tuesday.\\n\\nGREENE: But there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. I mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?\\n\\nJONES: Look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. Look at the people who've known Joe Biden for as long as they have. Look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.\\n\\nGREENE: So, I mean, I'm sure you're aware he faces an uphill battle going into Super Tuesday. I mean, he is at a huge fundraising disadvantage compared to Bernie Sanders right now. He's been behind in the polls in some very big states like California and Texas. How does he overcome that?\\n\\nJONES: Well, I think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. This is a delegate count number right now. This field is going to winnow down, and I think as Joe Biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond Super Tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for Joe Biden. This race is far from over. I think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual Democratic nominee. We've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. Yeah, Senator Sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the Democrats have been throughout this season, I think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around Joe Biden ultimately.\\n\\nGREENE: If Sanders emerges as the front-runner and ends up leading, possibly winning, the delegate count, are you ready to get behind him?\\n\\nJONES: You know, look, I disagree with Senator Sanders on many, many things. I think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. You know, one of the things that I'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the Democratic Party are heard. Right now, I'm having a hard time seeing that with Senator Sanders. But that's not to say he can't do it. We have got such a long way to go. I still believe this race is far from over. Instead of playing a speculation game, I think we need to let this matter play out. I think we need to let all the elections.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, what specifically worries you about Bernie Sanders? You said you're worried about him bringing all the - you know, a full coalition together. What are you specifically worried about?\\n\\nJONES: Look, I think that Senator Sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. But the way that they want to do things with Medicare for All I just don't think is a viable option. And I'm not sure how Senator Sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. That's just one issue. I think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. But my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.\\n\\nGREENE: Democratic Senator Doug Jones of the state of Alabama.

{"original": "Female Marines Join Fight Against Culture Of Sexism\\n\\nAfter seeing her photo with other female Marines get attacked on social media, Maj. Janine Garner joined about 100 other women to try to end sexism and misogyny in the Marine Corps.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nThe leaders of the U.S. Marine Corps are still trying to cope with a widespread scandal that came to light last month. Hundreds of Marines are being investigated for sharing nude photos in a closed Facebook group, photos of women, including fellow Marines, without their consent. The Pentagon is investigating, and Congress has held hearings.\\n\\nMeanwhile, women in the Marines say this is not an isolated incident, and the broader culture of the Marines is in need of change. This week, about a hundred of these Marine women signed an open letter to the service that said this.\\n\\nMAJOR JANINE GARNER: (Reading) We have allowed to thrive and, in some instances, even encouraged a culture where women are devalued, demeaned and their contributions diminished. We understand why. In a culture that prizes masculinity, it is easy to mistake barbarism for strength, brutality for power, savagery for ferocity.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nThat's Major Janine Garner, one of the Marines who signed the letter. She's a pilot based out of Cherry Point, N.C., and joins us now. Welcome.\\n\\nGARNER: Hi.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Why did you decide to address this issue in such a large scale, public way?\\n\\nGARNER: One of my experience in the Marine Corps, particularly given that I'm in aviation, has been one where women are frequently isolated and often wonder and think that these things that we experience happen only to us. Well, when my friends and I - my peers and I got together and we started talking - because obviously everybody was very upset with the - everything that happened with Marines United - and again, that was just the catalyst.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Marines United was the name of the photo-sharing page where all of this unfolded - yeah.\\n\\nGARNER: Exactly. So it was kind of a catalyst. And as we got together and we spoke, we realized that we couldn't stay quiet anymore and that by coming together, we had a much stronger voice than just kind of individually screaming, you know, in our little stovepipes I guess, for lack of a better term, that this was not OK.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Can you tell us about the personal experience you had that convinced you that things needed to change?\\n\\nGARNER: For me, it really came to a head back in I want to say around May of 2016 where a Facebook group similar to Marines United took a picture from my personal Instagram page that was a photo of me and seven other female marine field grade officers as we were at lunch in our uniforms and took this picture, posted it to the page.\\n\\nAnd I watched in real time as hundreds of people commented on this photo and said things like, you know - they wanted to rape us. They immediately reduced us to our sexuality, as to whether we were doable, not doable, every amount of vitriol. We were called the worst names. And I mean these were leaders in the Marine Corps. I guess for myself, I was less upset because I've dealt with stuff like this before, but these seven other women who I highly respect and admire who have deployed multiple times, gone to combat, are Marines just like everybody else were being demeaned in this way.\\n\\nAnd the conversation, because of the Marines United, was all about the nude photos. The dialogue kept being the nude photos, the nude photos, the nude photos. Oh, well they shouldn't have taken those pictures of themselves. The problem isn't the photos. The problem is the treatment of one Marine to another, and that is completely unacceptable and goes against our core ethos and values.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: On the policy level, what do you think needs to change in the Marine Corps?\\n\\nGARNER: Well, in terms of policies, the first change I'd really like to see is an increase of numbers of women in the Marine Corps. I believe we need to improve our recruitment and our retention of female Marines specifically. I'd like to see our numbers get up to at least 20 percent.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Now it's around 7 percent. Is that right?\\n\\nGARNER: It's currently around 7 percent. And in aviation, we make up less than 4 percent. For example, I'm at the largest Marine Corps air base, and I am the only female pilot on this base. And that's incredibly isolating, and that means wherever I go, I'm the unicorn. I'm, oh, the female pilot, if that makes sense. So it's still an oddity. It's still commented on.\\n\\nAnd one of the ways that this changes the culture is when female Marines become 1 in 5 of every Marine you have, at least it's no longer female Marine, male Marine. It's Marines at that point, which is how we should be looking at things anyway. But you no longer see them as the - oh, there's the token Marine for the squadron. Oh, there's the token female Marine for the section, you know? It's just Marines. It's normal. It stops being an oddity. We stop being other.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: And in terms of the culture, which is much more difficult to change, what kinds of changes do you think need to be made there?\\n\\nGARNER: In the past when we've had issues with, say, drinking and driving, drug use - in the '90s, a big problem was racism - the Marine Corps basically sat down and said, no, this is completely unacceptable; we're going to change the culture in this. And it took time, but the way the Marine Corps did it was through a lot of education and a lot of training. Young recruits and poolees - poolees being before they go off to recruit training when they're talking to recruiters - knew right from the get-go where the Marine Corps stood as far as drug use, as far as alcohol abuse, racism and things like that. And so coming into the Marine Corps, they knew what the stance was. And we saw over time a drastic change.\\n\\nThere are very, very strict career repercussions when you violate these policies, and everybody knows that. That's Marine Corps-wide. That took several years to change. But we can do the same with this subculture of sexism and misogyny in the Marine Corps. Nobody is born a misogynist. It's learned behavior, and it can be unlearned.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: I know some women were afraid of speaking out, worried that there could be career repercussions. Do you think that's a justified fear? Did you have that fear yourself?\\n\\nGARNER: I absolutely had that fear myself. I spent so much time, particularly my first few years in the Marine Corps, just trying to be accepted that I didn't speak up many times when I probably should have because I didn't want to call additional attention to myself. And in many ways, it was just about kind of survival, if that makes sense. And I think there's always that fear.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: You're obviously extremely accomplished, have lots of options available to you. Why stay and try to fix this broken culture rather than just say, I'm not appreciated here; I'll take my talents elsewhere?\\n\\nGARNER: Because the Marine Corps is amazing, and it's wonderful. And the majority of the people in the Marine Corps are people - they're the reason I joined. They're honest, good people who are committed to serving this country and defending Americans and the Constitution. There are no better people I would want to be working with and mentoring.\\n\\nI don't want to leave a Marine Corps that is less than what it could be. It's an amazing institution and, in my opinion, should be setting the example for every other military service out there, for every other organization out there. And my job as a leader in the Marine Corps is to continue to make the Marine Corps better and to continue to push that. So that's why I stay. I stay for the generations behind me.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Major Janine Garner is a pilot in Cherry Point, N.C. Major Garner, thanks for speaking with us, and thank you for your service.\\n\\nGARNER: Anytime.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "In New Hampshire Debate, Iowa Winners Sanders, Buttigieg Get More Scrutiny\\n\\nAfter a fourth-place finish in Iowa, former vice president Joe Biden was more aggressive, taking shots at the Vermont senator and Indiana mayor. New Hampshire voters will make their picks Tuesday.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidates met onstage in New Hampshire last night, all seven - Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. But the focus was mostly on Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden, the two top finishers in Iowa and the national front-runner whose caucus showing was fourth. NPR's Scott Detrow is in Manchester, N.H. Scott, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, good morning.\\n\\nSIMON: Joe Biden came into the debate under a lot of pressure after that fourth-place finish. What seemed to be his approach?\\n\\nDETROW: You know, his goal for every single debate, up until now, is to really escape without making any news, without taking too many hits. That's a great strategy when you're the front-runner. It's not a good strategy when he came in fourth place in Iowa. So he took a much different approach last night right off the bat - very first answer, criticizing both Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the two candidates who essentially tied in Iowa, starting with the fact that Bernie Sanders is someone who identifies as a democratic socialist.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: I think that's the label that the president's going to lay on everyone running with Bernie, if he's the nominee. And Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He's a mayor of a small city who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to - and we'll soon find out - to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.\\n\\nDETROW: But Biden said something really remarkable right off the top at this debate, saying that he may do poorly in New Hampshire, as well. And that's just a really stunning thing to say when you are the candidate who has based his entire candidacy on being the most electable, the person who can go up against Donald Trump, the one that voters know and respect the most. If you can't come close to winning in the first two states, that says something.\\n\\nSIMON: And Pete Buttigieg got a lot of scrutiny last night, didn't he?\\n\\nDETROW: He did. And that's what happens when you appear at the top of the finish in Iowa - as best as we can tell, at least. He got questions from moderators and other candidates about his lack of national experience. You know, despite the fact that the current president had a reality TV background, it's pretty extraordinary that the mayor of a city of about 100,000 is now among the front-runners for the presidential nomination. He was criticized by Elizabeth Warren and others for how South Bend's police force has treated African Americans - disproportionate arrest rates and drug charges, among other things. He also got a lot of questions about foreign policy. But that is an area where Buttigieg seemed very comfortable, repeatedly drawing on his time serving in Afghanistan. There was one moment that stood out to me when the moderator David Muir of ABC repeatedly pressed Buttigieg on whether he would have ordered a strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani as President Trump did.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nDAVID MUIR: I'm asking if your national security team came to you and presented you with the opportunity, would you take the strike?\\n\\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative. And it depends what the different effects would be. That's my point. This is not an episode of 24. This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture.\\n\\nSIMON: Let's turn now to Bernie Sanders, who was the other top performer in Iowa. We heard Joe Biden say that Bernie Sanders just isn't electable. Were there other moments that he had to defend parts of his record or other criticism?\\n\\nDETROW: Yeah. Biden raised some other criticisms. And this is something his campaign has raised a bit. And we also saw Hillary Clinton use this a lot against Sanders in 2016. It's the fact that as a congressman in the 1990s, Bernie Sanders voted against several gun control measures, particularly - multiple times - the Brady Bill, which established background checks. Sanders' response was that he supported assault weapons bans all along - going back to his first run for Congress, voted for one during that period - and that, for the record, he says he was representing the views of his rural state at the time but that gun violence has gotten a lot worse since then and his views have changed.\\n\\nSIMON: Scott, three more full days of campaigning...\\n\\nDETROW: Yes.\\n\\nSIMON: ...Before people actually cast ballots. What are you looking for?\\n\\nDETROW: Well, Tuesday night, whether they can count the votes correctly.\\n\\nSIMON: Ooh.\\n\\nDETROW: And also look.\\n\\nSIMON: Ooh.\\n\\nDETROW: I mean, it's hanging over everything. Does another candidate force herself or himself into this conversation? Or does this amplify the results of Iowa and make this race continue to be focused on Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders? How does Joe Biden do? And I think mostly turnout. Iowa turnout was pretty flat from 2016. And that really worried a lot of Democrats who thought that they would have a lot more energy going into this race. It's just one state. There were other issues. So I'm looking to see what turnout is in New Hampshire.\\n\\nSIMON: NPR's Scott Detrow in Manchester, N.H., thanks so much.\\n\\nDETROW: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "North Korean Leader Addresses Policy Issues In New Year's Address\\n\\nKim Jong Un declared that —while denuclearization is still his goal — his nation may have to follow a new path if the U.S. insists on unilateral action on that issue.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SOLAR HEAVY'S CATCHING COMETS)\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nNorth Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, says he is ready to meet with President Trump at any time. He made that offer in a televised New Year's address. He also recommitted himself to abandoning nuclear weapons but only if the U.S. sticks to its promises. NPR's Anthony Kuhn joins us now from Seoul to talk about what all this could mean. Good morning, Anthony. Happy New Year.\\n\\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Happy New Year, Rachel.\\n\\nMARTIN: So after the Singapore summit last year, when President Trump met face to face with Kim Jong Un. Trump says, quote, We are ready to write a new chapter between our nations. So in light of this address from Kim Jong Un, are you seeing any evidence of a new chapter?\\n\\nKUHN: No. The speech was pretty much what analysts expected. And it didn't leave much room for optimism that the current stalemate over the nuclear issue is going to be broken soon. Kim said in his speech that he's serious about improving relations with the U.S. and completely denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. But he also - you know, he continued the North Korean line, which for months has been, look. We've made gestures to the U.S., such as dismantling nuclear and missile test sites. And now it's up to the U.S. It's the U.S.'s turn to reciprocate by easing sanctions or giving some sort of security guarantee. Let's hear a clip of Kim speaking today.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).\\n\\nKUHN: If the U.S. fails to keep the promises it made before the world, he says, if it misjudges the patience of our people and continues to use sanctions and pressure against our republic, then we'll have no choice except to seek a new path to secure the sovereignty and interests of our country.\\n\\nAnd he did not say, Rachel, exactly what this new path is. But he did describe the old path as one of the most hostile relations in the world between the U.S. and North Korea and has suggested that he might go back to that. Also, we noted that he was speaking from a very plushly upholstered sofa in a wood-paneled office. And, clearly, this appeared to make him look like a - calculated to make him look like a mature statesman rather than a dictator.\\n\\nMARTIN: So what exactly does he want right now, Kim Jong Un?\\n\\nKUHN: Well, you remember from the summit in Singapore that they reached the vaguest of deals and that the U.S. and North Korea have completely different understandings of denuclearization. And the - North Korea has stuck to their definition, which is that they expect the U.S. to remove the U.S. nuclear umbrella that protects South Korea and Japan. And from the U.S. side, that's not on the negotiating table. And today, Kim added on. He said, we want to see an end to U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises that President Trump suspended after the summit.\\n\\nMARTIN: I want to pivot to the South because the U.S. and South Korea were supposed to strike this new deal about the price of keeping U.S. military footprint in South Korea. And they were supposed to agree to this by New Year's Eve. They didn't. So now what?\\n\\nKUHN: Well, the U.S. is asking for all its allies to cough up more money. South Korean media report that the U.S. is looking for a 50 percent increase. And South Korea says no to that. Seoul was not happy about the U.S. pullout from Syria and the resignation of Mattis. And they point out, look. If you pull out of South Korea, you're not just undermining our defense. You're undermining the entire U.S. military posture in Asia.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR's Anthony Kuhn from Seoul. Thanks so much, Anthony.\\n\\nKUHN: You bet, Rachel.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "Alaska Feels The Brunt As Investors Promise Retreat On Fossil Fuels\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Thiessen/AP Mark Thiessen/AP\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase is the latest in a growing list of investors to restrict work with coal companies and stop funding new oil and gas projects in the Arctic. Its announcement this week was met with disappointment from environmental advocates, who want more aggressive action from one of the fossil fuel industry's biggest lenders.\\n\\nBut the news has hit harder in Alaska, where most oil is produced from the Arctic's North Slope, and the government depends on the industry for revenue. The string of announcements has left elected officials and oil companies playing defense.\\n\\nIn December, Goldman Sachs said the bank would refuse to finance Arctic drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Since then Barclays and Lloyds Bank of Great Britain have also effectively ruled out investments in new projects there, after environmentalists raised concerns about impacts on ecosystems, indigenous people and the global climate.\\n\\nOne position by one large company I don't think changes a lot, says Andy Mack, a former Alaska natural resources commissioner who helped lead the state's push to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling. But if you see two or three or four large companies make these types of announcements, it's certainly something that oil companies will all have to take into account.\\n\\nMany other investors remain for Arctic projects, and the Trump administration has pushed to open the Arctic Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to new development. But an aggressive environmental advocacy campaign has created undeniable obstacles for businessmen like Mead Treadwell, who's seeking investment for his company Qilak LNG.\\n\\nQilak is pushing a liquefied natural gas project on the North Slope, and Treadwell has honed his pitch accordingly, to respond to the questions and concerns he expects from bankers.\\n\\nHe plays up the fact that Qilak's LNG project would connect to infrastructure that already largely exists on the North Slope — not to new oil fields, which conservation groups say would extend the world's dependence on climate-warming fossil fuels.\\n\\nTreadwell also makes the case that LNG often displaces dirty coal-fired power plants, though the environmental benefits of that change are disputed by some scientists. And he highlights the jobs the project could create for indigenous residents of the North Slope and other areas of Alaska.\\n\\nIt's easier to show up at an annual meeting in some place like London or Brussels wearing a polar bear suit. There's not a similar symbol for Louisiana or Texas.\\n\\nI still believe that we will have billions of dollars in annual investment in the Arctic, Treadwell says. But it's easier to show up at an annual meeting in some place like London or Brussels wearing a polar bear suit. There's not a similar symbol for Louisiana or Texas.\\n\\nAlaska's economy is driven by the production of fossil fuels, which makes the state especially vulnerable to the campaign to transition away from oil. About a third of the state's unrestricted revenue comes from taxes and royalties tied to oil production.\\n\\nThe environmental movement has been targeting Arctic oil and gas projects in particular, arguing that development in the area poses unique environmental and social risks. Democratic members of Congress also got involved after Goldman Sachs' announcement, writing to other banks to ask them to follow the company's lead.\\n\\nSeveral big Arctic oil projects are still under development on Alaska's North Slope. But there's a growing acknowledgment that the environmental lobbying is having an effect.\\n\\n'Arctic' seems to have turned into a four-letter word in the minds of a lot of these financial institutions, says an Alaska oil executive, who asked not to be named to avoid drawing attention to his particular company.\\n\\nHitting back by punishing banks\\n\\nGov. Mike Dunleavy reacted to Goldman Sachs' announcement by firing the company from a group of Wall Street firms it had chosen to help the state borrow money.\\n\\nIn an interview, Dunleavy suggested another way to punish banks that refuse to invest in Alaska oil projects: cutting them off from managing the assets of the $67 billion state-owned Permanent Fund, which was originally created with oil revenue. Goldman Sachs manages some $400 million for the fund, which paid the firm a total of $17 million in fees over the past three years.\\n\\nSome of these groups that don't want to do business in Alaska still want Alaska business, Dunleavy says. They probably are going to come out a loser on that one.\\n\\nIn Washington, D.C., the members of Alaska's GOP Congressional delegation have sent their own letters to banking executives. I can tell you for a fact I have never signed on to a letter that would specifically target investment opportunities in another colleague's state, to shut that down, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in an interview.\\n\\nShe and other Alaska politicians note that there's support for continuing Arctic oil production among the North Slope's indigenous Inupiat people, who have benefited financially from development.\\n\\nThe North Slope Borough's mayor, Harry Brower, writing in the Wall Street Journal, called Goldman Sachs' new investment policy subtly racist, and argued that it would effectively deny modern amenities to the region's isolated villages.\\n\\nAnother indigenous group, the Gwich'in, has fought oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, citing risks to the caribou that they subsist on.\\n\\nBrad Keithley, a retired oil and gas attorney, says there's a new argument that Alaska leaders could use to make their case to financial institutions. The state's oil industry uses comparatively little energy to produce its fossil fuels, according to newly-presented analysis from the Climate Leadership Council, an international group pushing a carbon fee and dividend program as a way to reduce emissions. In an email, council spokesman Carlton Carroll says that's in part because of Alaska's restrictions on flaring natural gas, and the industry's consolidated and efficient infrastructure in the state.\\n\\nThose working to push financial institutions out of the oil industry, meanwhile, argue that Alaska's political leaders should be doing more to prepare the state for an economic future that's less dependent on fossil fuels.\\n\\nThere's an opportunity to plan ahead, says Ruth Breech of the Rainforest Action Network. That's why the leadership is important now."}

Ready to play?\\n\\nGLAZER: I am.\\n\\nSAGAL: All right, here is your first quote.\\n\\nKURTIS: And he put himself through Harvard Law School by selling his comic book collection.\\n\\nSAGAL: That was President Obama laying out the qualifications of Merrick Garland, the man he decided to hang out to dry...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...By nominating him to what?\\n\\nGLAZER: The Supreme Court.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes, indeed, Millie...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...The Supreme Court.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Just as Scalia's body had barely traded stare decisis for rigor mortis...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...When Republicans said they would not consider any nominee to replace him picked by President Obama, based on the Constitution's little-known no-backsies clause.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So President Obama knew whoever he nominated wasn't going to get confirmed no matter what he did. We don't know why he just didn't mess with the Senate - like, here's my dog, Bo.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Look how cute he looks in a robe.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: But no, he nominated what was supposed to be a consensus choice - this older white guy, a moderate who Obama stressed over and over everybody likes. He's nice, he's smart. His name sounds like an old-timey Christmas tradition. Hey honey, let's bring out the Merrick Garland and drink some 'nog.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: Let's bring out the Merrick Garland then not let it be part of Christmas.\\n\\nSAGAL: I know.\\n\\nGROSZ: We won't even be hearing anything from the Merrick Garland on principle.\\n\\nSAGAL: I don't know if you watched the announcement in the Rose Garden, but as soon as Judge Garland stepped to the microphone, he started sobbing. Well, wouldn't you? It's like being a cow who just got nominated to dinner.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTOM BODETT: I thought - it's brilliant what's happening here. It's like if you've got - if you've ever had, like, a car deal go south on you? You know, where the dealer just hates you and you hate the dealer. Years later you go back.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: And you say I want to buy that car except I'm not negotiating with you. I don't want to negotiate. I'm going to give you what you're asking for for the car.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: No, I'm not selling you this car. Listen, my wife's going to come in here and give you half what that car's worth, so...\\n\\nSAGAL: I think at this point, we're really dealing...\\n\\nBODETT: I mean, I think this is what's happening...\\n\\nSAGAL: Aren't we dealing more, Tom, with your experience with a particular auto dealer...\\n\\nBODETT: No.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Than the Supreme Court? It seems like we're talking about something else.\\n\\nBODETT: Well, when that idea came into my head it made so much more sense...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: ...Than it did as it passed out of my mouth.\\n\\nGROSZ: It's like this - it's like you're trying to come up with a metaphor for something, right?\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: Well, exactly.\\n\\nGROSZ: And you've got a perfectly good one, and you think hey, you should accept this metaphor.\\n\\nBODETT: Right.\\n\\nGROSZ: And then you just keep talking. And then you realize this isn't a very good metaphor...\\n\\nBODETT: No, exactly.\\n\\nGROSZ: ...At all.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, I think what you're trying to say is that President Obama made the Senate an offered that he didn't think they would refuse. So many Republicans are on record praising the man. The White House played an audiotape of Orrin Hatch back in 2010 asking Judge Garland if he wanted to, quote, Netflix and chill.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: Obama should have dressed up like a different person and, like, someone they like...\\n\\nSAGAL: Changed his voice.\\n\\nGROSZ: Yeah, and, like, my name is Darrell Williams. I just became president. I have white skin. This is the person I'm nominating. Oh, President Williams, I like this guy...\\n\\nFRANKLIN: And by the way...\\n\\nGROSZ: He's very interesting.\\n\\nFRANKLIN: Whiteface is always acceptable...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: It is.\\n\\nFRANKLIN: ...Just so you know.\\n\\nSAGAL: All right.\\n\\nBODETT: You know, he should've found, like, some lawyer or some circuit judge somewhere named Alexander Hamilton...\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh yeah.\\n\\nBODETT: ...And nominated - Senate refuses to interview Alexander Hamilton. That would just work beautifully.\\n\\nGROSZ: He should've nominated Mitch McConnell, and then Mitch McConnell's head would have exploded.\\n\\nSAGAL: It'd be like one of those androids...\\n\\nGROSZ: Yeah.\\n\\nSAGAL: ...On the old Star Trek.\\n\\nGROSZ: (Imitating robot) I must refuse myself. I'm in a recursive loop of hatred.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: For your next quote, Millie, here is somebody describing who he consults for foreign-policy advice.\\n\\nKURTIS: I'm speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKURTIS: And I've said a lot of things.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: So who is constantly talking to himself about foreign policy?\\n\\nGLAZER: Donald Trump?\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes, indeed...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Donald Trump.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh yes, clap for Donald Trump. You might as well get used to it because it will be required soon.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: You've got to give Donald Trump points. Many people hear voices in their heads telling them to do crazy things, but few admit it live on Morning Joe.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: It's worth pointing out in regard to that remarkable thing that Donald Trump said that Donald Trump's famous for his adjectives - things are huge, amazing, unbelievable, terrific. But when talking about his own brain he just went with very good.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBODETT: Yeah, that's almost like admitting a disability in his case, yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Exactly. Now, Mr. Trump of course won 4 out 5 states on Tuesday. People are still saying he can be stopped at a contested convention. GOP leadership, the people who are against Trump, they don't - they say it's not going to be a contested convention. No, they want to call it an open convention, quote, unquote. Like, an open marriage, you know? It sounds fun and sexy, and then your wife starts dating Donald Trump.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: That would actually be a great way to figure out who's president is you have a key party. And then all the Republican candidates just put their keys in a bowl...\\n\\nBODETT: Oh yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: ...And then whoever's...\\n\\nSAGAL: This...\\n\\nGROSZ: ...Key's get picked out the most - we just get screwed by them for four years.\\n\\nSAGAL: I actually...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: All right, Millie - here - here Millie is your last quote.\\n\\nKURTIS: I would also love for you to come with your wonderful, lovely wife.\\n\\nSAGAL: That was a man in Cuba writing to a man who is, in fact, finally coming to visit next week. Who is it?\\n\\nGLAZER: President Obama.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes indeed, President Obama...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Very good.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes. Barack Obama is going to Cuba. That is not an email from your birther uncle. That is actual news.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Mr. Obama will be the first sitting president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge. True, around the brothels of old Havana, he was his howling Cal.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: Can't keep him silent down here.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah, I know.\\n\\nBODETT: You get the boy out of Vermont...\\n\\nSAGAL: So the president - this is all true. This has happened just this year, 2016, so far - he's hung out with Kendrick Lamar and Misty Copeland in the Oval Office. He's gone to South by Southwest. Now he's heading to Cuba for a road trip. It is not the last year of his presidency. It's the best year of his 20s.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSZ: It's kind of awesome. He's just going to - I think this all he's going to do. He'll never wear a tie again...\\n\\nSAGAL: No.\\n\\nGROSZ: ...I also don't think. He's not going to come back from Cuba.\\n\\nSAGAL: No, why would he?\\n\\nBODETT: Wouldn't it be great to see him fall out the door of Air Force One...\\n\\nGROSZ: Like Dean Martin holding a cocktail? Hey, how'd all these people get in my living room?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Millie do on our quiz?\\n\\nKURTIS: Millie's very smart. She got every single one right - all three.\\n\\nSAGAL: Well done, Millie.\\n\\nGLAZER: Thank you.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSAGAL: Congratulations and thanks for calling.\\n\\nGLAZER: Thanks for having me.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

{"original": "Member Of Congressional Black Caucus: Trump Has Brought Normalized Racism To White House\\n\\nDemocratic Rep. Karen Bass is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. NPR's Michel Martin talks to her about President Trump's relationship with the group of lawmakers, and his presidency so far.\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nI also spoke with Congresswoman Karen Bass. She is a Democrat from California. And she also has a deep background as a lawmaker, having served as a former speaker of the California Assembly. She's also an officer of the Congressional Black Caucus. When we spoke, I began by asking her to reflect on then-candidate Trump's attempt to appeal to African-American voters when he famously said, what do you have to lose?\\n\\nKAREN BASS: They used to refer to him as a dog whistle, but I think most people now recognize it's a bullhorn. I think this last year has been absolutely positively horrific. We have seen a level of racism become normalized, something that we haven't seen for decades. And anytime you have the president of the United States making statements like he did a week ago about the entire continent of Africa, it's - he's consistent. How he views people of color around the world is the same as he views people of color in the United States. When he's talking about making America great again, many of us hear that as making America white again.\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, let's go back to when you and other officers from the Congressional Black Caucus actually met with President Trump. That was in March of last year. Do you remember that meeting? Do you remember what your impressions were of him then?\\n\\nBASS: I remember the meeting extremely well. And I do think it's important to say what led to the meeting because, you remember, there was a press conference in which he was asked about his urban agenda. And a reporter said, have you consulted the Congressional Black Caucus? He didn't know who the CBC was. But he did say to the reporter, who happened to be African-American, well, do you know them? You know, can you organize the meeting? As, of course, all black people do know each other.\\n\\nAnd so the Congressional Black Caucus was extended an invitation for all 49 of our members to go to the White House. We chose to just send the leadership. We took the time to write a 125-page document that basically said, this is what we have to lose. Each of us made a presentation on a substantive area of policy. Mine was criminal justice. And basically, he wasn't really able to have a dialogue. We do think he paid attention. I just don't think that there was any there there to actually have a dialogue with us. And then he also made it clear just a few days ago what he thinks about the Congressional Black Caucus. When the Democratic senators mentioned that the CBC would be upset at the immigration proposal, he basically said he had no interest in what the Congressional Black Caucus said.\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, speaking of those comments, I mean, over the course of the year, and even before that during the campaign, there were many remarks and tweets and policy proposals aimed at a lot of groups, you know - Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Muslims, Muslim-Americans. And a lot of these comments have sparked commentary. But it's only after those comments about those countries that that he is reported to have made - and he denies that he said that - but it is after that that many people, including some of your colleagues, have said that they believe that he's racist, that he harbors racist views. They've been very blunt about that over the course of the week. And I'd like to ask you. And I think you may have already answered that. Do you think that that's true?\\n\\nBASS: I think he has demonstrated that he is a racist, and he's demonstrated that over many decades, going back to when he was a young man in the housing discrimination lawsuits. But I will tell you something. It's way more significant to me. His policies are far more significant, and he demonstrated that on the first few days of his presidency.\\n\\nOn his first day of the presidency, he eliminated a program that gave tax credits for first-time homeowners. He rolled back consent decrees with troubled police departments. He's tried to eliminate the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. They were seeking attorneys that wanted to overturn affirmative action.\\n\\nHis words are horrific, but his policies are damaging. And the wreckage that he has done to the government, even without congressional involvement, is, to me, far more important. You know, attacking NFL players, I mean, that was egregious. But doing what he's done policy wise is far, far more significant and dangerous to our communities.\\n\\nMARTIN: That is Congresswoman Karen Bass, Democrat of California. She's one of the officers of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congresswoman, thank you so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nBASS: Thanks for having me on.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "What's New In Those DHS Memos On Immigration Enforcement?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bryan Cox/ICE via AP Bryan Cox/ICE via AP\\n\\nEver since Donald Trump entered the presidential race, his comments on illegal immigration have been pored over in the press — from vows to deport millions of people to promises that any enforcement plan would have a lot of heart. Observers asked, again and again, how rhetoric would translate into actual policy.\\n\\nNow activists and experts have the policies themselves to examine.\\n\\nOn Jan. 25, Trump signed a pair of executive orders on immigration enforcement (not to be confused with his travel ban affecting refugees and seven majority-Muslim countries). The documents signaled that he would pursue a path of greatly expanded deportations — and an actual wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security released two memos outlining how those orders would be enforced. The memos, signed by Secretary John Kelly, have been described by immigration activists as a blueprint for mass deportation, though the administration has denied that.\\n\\nIt will take time for some of the new policies to be made reality — and in certain cases, DHS must wait for funding from Congress. But in the meantime, here are a few key takeaways:\\n\\nThe memos, like the orders, drastically expand the category of people classified as priorities for removal\\n\\nUnder the Obama administration, immigrants in the U.S. illegally who had been convicted of serious crimes were prioritized for deportations. Under the new rules, federal agents could seek to deport people in the country illegally who were convicted of any crime, no matter how minor. In fact, agents could prioritize for deportation people who have just been charged with a crime — or people who have committed an act for which they could be charged.\\n\\nAnyone who has abused any program related to receipt of public benefits, and anyone an immigration officer deems a risk to public safety or national security, also could be marked as a priority.\\n\\nThe shift in policy could affect up to 11 million people\\n\\nImmigration advocates have highlighted, in particular, the fact that people who have committed an act for which they could face charges could be made a priority.\\n\\nBecause immigrants can technically face charges for entering the country illegally, NPR's Adrian Florido explained in January, the policy potentially makes any immigrant in the U.S. illegally a deportation priority just by virtue of being present.\\n\\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, there were 11.1 million people living in the U.S. illegally in 2014; two-thirds of them have been in the country for a decade or more, Pew says. That year, more than half of immigrants in the country illegally were from Mexico, 15 percent were from Central America and 13 percent from Asia. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has more on the demographics of the group.\\n\\nThe memo preserves Obama's protections for DREAMers, at least for now\\n\\nDuring Barack Obama's presidency, an executive action called DACA — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — offered temporary work permits and protection from deportation to people who arrived in the U.S. as children. It covered hundreds of thousands of people, sometimes referred to as DREAMers.\\n\\nThere was broad concern among people with DACA protections that Trump would end the program, and January's executive orders didn't offer any clear signal about the program's future.\\n\\nBut the DHS memos explicitly state that DACA remains in effect. They also state that DAPA, a program for the parents of U.S. citizens that has never been implemented, will be addressed in future guidance.\\n\\nDHS plans to hire thousands more agents ...\\n\\nThe memos, like the original orders, call for 10,000 more officers and agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 5,000 more at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\n\\nThat will require funding from Congress. And CBP, which has struggled with preventing corruption, already has trouble filling open positions, according to a recent report from The Associated Press that focused on the CBP's use of polygraph tests in hiring.\\n\\n... and ICE and CBP will resume partnerships with local law enforcement officers\\n\\nThe federal 287(g) program authorizing state and local officers to identify and arrest people who are in the U.S. illegally has been controversial; the Obama administration pared down the program's use after allegations that it led to racial profiling. You might remember Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's use of the program in Arizona, which was suspended in 2011 after the Justice Department found that county officers unlawfully stopped and detained Latinos.\\n\\nIn the memos, DHS officials call the 287(g) program a force multiplier and say the assistance of state and local police is critical to immigration enforcement. Kelly calls for ICE and the CBP to immediately partner with all willing and qualified jurisdictions.\\n\\nUnaccompanied children could be deported, and their parents could be prosecuted\\n\\nWhen draft versions of the memos leaked last week, one policy in particular made headlines: a directive to deport some unaccompanied children, and deport or prosecute anyone who helped bring a child into the U.S. illegally.\\n\\nThere's no exemption in the new policies for parents who are attempting to bring their own children to live with them in the U.S. In fact, parents and family members are explicitly identified as subject to prosecution if they have paid to have their children brought across the border.\\n\\nTragically, many of these children fall victim to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, sexual assault, and other crimes of violence by the smugglers and other criminal elements along the dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States, one memo reads.\\n\\nRegardless of the desires for family reunification, or conditions in other countries, the smuggling or trafficking of alien children is intolerable.\\n\\nStephen Legomsky, who served as chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration, says prosecution in such instances would be a new step for the U.S. government.\\n\\nI can't think of any precedent, ever, for any administration to criminally prosecute parents for paying to have their children smuggled, he says.\\n\\nThere is some historical precedent for the other option the memo raises, of deporting parents who have their children smuggled in. Decades ago, immigration officials used to use an unaccompanied child's arrival to facilitate deportation of the parent — but the practice generated such ill will that the government stopped doing it, Legomsky says.\\n\\nMore people already in the U.S. could be deported without review by a judge ...\\n\\nThe memos say the department wants to expand what's known as expedited removal, which means that migrants don't go before an immigration judge — they're just deported, with no hearing or review.\\n\\nUnder Obama, this expedited process was used only for recently arrived immigrants within 100 miles of the border.\\n\\nDHS is looking to expand expedited removal all over country, for any immigrant who can't show he has been in the U.S. for at least two years.\\n\\n... and arriving asylum seekers might be detained in Mexico even if they aren't from Mexico\\n\\nKelly calls for people caught crossing the border who would like to appeal for asylum to be returned to the foreign contiguous territory from which they arrived, pending the outcome of removal proceedings.\\n\\nProPublica has reported on the implications of this policy. Journalists Ginger Thompson and Marcelo Rochabrun write that based on current trends, the plan could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Brazilians, Ecuadorans, even Haitians.\\n\\nThey'd communicate with U.S. immigration officials via video conference calls ... from facilities that Mexico would presumably be forced to build, ProPublica reports.\\n\\nKelly's memos say the policy would free up detention and adjudication resources in the U.S. for the department to use in other priority cases.\\n\\nThe administration plans to move forward with a border wall\\n\\nAccording to the memos, CBP shall immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall ... along the land border with Mexico.\\n\\nNPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has written about the logistical hurdles and high cost of such a wall, which one poll suggests 37 percent of Americans support.\\n\\nOur reporters have also written extensively about the environmental impact of a wall, the economic consequences of a tariff to pay for the cost, and the difficulties of building existing fences along some of the border.\\n\\nIf you're curious about what the barriers along the border look like now, check out Fence Facts, from NPR's Borderland project.\\n\\nOpen questions: Where, how and with what funds will detention centers and courts be expanded?\\n\\nThe note about detention and adjudication resources raises a big question: How will the Department of Homeland Security handle expanded deportations at the level indicated by the memos?\\n\\nThere are already massive backlogs at immigration courts across the country; the memos call for a surge in immigration judges. And for the past few years, the department has had roughly 34,000 beds at detention centers. The memos call for detention capabilities to be expanded, focusing on areas near the border, but don't get more specific about how.\\n\\nDHS is the first to note that it will take time and money to scale up deportations. That's one reason it pushes back on descriptions of the memos as enabling mass deportations — it says it needs time to implement many of the new policies, and thus there's no need for panic.\\n\\nBut how long it will take, how much it will cost and where the money will come from isn't clear.\\n\\nDHS relies largely on private, for-profit prisons — which currently hold more 70 percent of the department's detainees, as NPR's John Burnett reported last month. Trump has also spoken positively about private prisons.\\n\\nAs a result, many anticipate that an expansion of DHS operations will be profitable for private prison companies. John notes that for-profit detention at all levels has been sharply criticized. Complaints include poor living conditions, understaffing, security risks, mismanagement and poor medical care.\\n\\nLast year, the Justice Department announced it would phase out the use of private prisons. The decision did not affect DHS."}

U.S. financial markets fell again on concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. And, details of a new development in medicine.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nIt is far from a done deal, but this morning after Super Tuesday, we're a lot closer to knowing who the 2020 Democratic nominee for president will be.\\n\\nNOEL KING, HOST:\\n\\nRemember; this started out as the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history. The front-runners now are two white men in their 70s, both with long political careers - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: Just a few days ago, the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\\n\\n(BOOING)\\n\\nBIDEN: And then came South Carolina, and they had something to say about it.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nBIDEN: And we were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it'd be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering).\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBERNIE SANDERS: Tonight, I tell you with absolute confidence, we are going to win the Democratic nomination.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nMARTIN: The voices of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders after last night's contests. We've got NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson with us to clarify what has happened and what it means going forward. Hi, Mara.\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.\\n\\nMARTIN: So it was a late night for all of us as we watched these returns come in. Big headline is that Joe Biden needed to do well. And he did, right?\\n\\nLIASSON: Yes, he did. The big question going in was, would Bernie Sanders end the night on a glide path to a plurality of delegates with an all-but-insurmountable lead? We came out of the night with Biden with the most votes and delegates so far, and maybe he's on track to get a plurality before the convention. The race is now a two-man fight for delegates.\\n\\nYesterday was a test of three things - money, momentum and movement or organization. It turns out money didn't mean so much. Bloomberg spent a ton of it and didn't do very well. In terms of movement and organization, well, Bernie Sanders had that in spades. Joe Biden only had one field office in California...\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nLIASSON: ...And one in Virginia. In some places, he didn't even campaign. It turns out that free media - earned media - momentum really mattered. And that's what Joe Biden had. He had endorsements, and it translated into wins. Who would've thunk it?\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nLIASSON: You know? Historical rules only work till they stop working.\\n\\nMARTIN: Until they don't work anymore.\\n\\nLIASSON: That's what we learned last night.\\n\\nMARTIN: (Laughter) Right. So we should just point out, we hear a lot about the fact that Bernie Sanders took California; Joe Biden came out on top of Texas - two very delegate-rich states. But it doesn't mean that each of those candidates walks away with all those delegates, right?\\n\\nLIASSON: No, because it's not a winner-take-all system the way the Republicans have. There's a 15% threshold. You don't get any delegates unless you get over 15% of the popular vote. If no one else gets 15%, then you can take all the delegates or a huge amount of the delegates - a bigger percentage of the delegates than the percentage of the popular vote that you got. But if a lot of other candidates get over 15%, then the winner of the state ends up taking a smaller percentage of the delegates than the percentage they got of the popular vote. That's why it's very important to see the final delegate totals.\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nLIASSON: We don't have those yet. But if you win big, you get more delegates than if you win by a smaller margin.\\n\\nMARTIN: All right. So let's talk about Elizabeth Warren, who did not have a good night. She really needed to do well or at least have a showing, right?\\n\\nLIASSON: Needed to do well. She came in third in her own home state of Massachusetts. She lost this place she was born, Oklahoma. And then, of course, that follows her fourth-place finish in the neighboring state of New Hampshire. But last night, she did not give any indication of giving up. Here's what she said.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nELIZABETH WARREN: No matter how scared you are, no matter how hard it looks, you get out there, and you fight for the people you love.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nLIASSON: So what Elizabeth Warren is going to do next is the subject of a lot of speculation. She had talked earlier about maybe a brokered convention; that was her path to the nomination.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah.\\n\\nLIASSON: But now she's splitting the left lane of the party with Bernie Sanders. Is that what she wants? Or will she drop out and endorse him? No one knows.\\n\\nMARTIN: All right. Let's finish on Mike Bloomberg because this is the first time he actually appeared on any ballot. He has spent an enormous amount of money. He only took American Samoa, a territory, last night. So what happens to his campaign moving forward?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, he's reassessing his campaign. But even if he doesn't continue as a candidate, he is still on track to play what could be a game-changing and historic role in the election because he has said he will spend whatever it takes - billions of dollars if necessary - to support whoever is the nominee of the party. And he'll fund down-ballot Democratic candidates. He'll fund get-out-the-vote drives. He'll fund everything. That's what he says he'll do. And that is pretty significant.\\n\\nMARTIN: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson on the results of Super Tuesday. Mara, thank you.\\n\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nMARTIN: OK. The World Health Organization says that the death rate of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus - that death rate is now at about 3.4%, which is higher than previously thought. The battle against coronavirus is really happening on a lot of different fronts, including at the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nKING: Yeah. That's right. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut yesterday to try to protect the economy from the effects of the virus, but it didn't seem to work. The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all fell yesterday anyway.\\n\\nMARTIN: We've got NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. So Scott, just start with what was supposed to happen. What was the intention of the Fed in making this rate cut?\\n\\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on Wall Street since the financial crisis. This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. They don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJEROME POWELL: We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.\\n\\nHORSLEY: The initial reaction in the stock market was positive. The Dow jumped about 300 points when the news first broke. But the more investors thought about it, the less they liked it. And the major indexes ended the day down around 3%.\\n\\nMARTIN: Right. So what went wrong? I mean, how did he miscalculate?\\n\\nHORSLEY: Well, it is odd because just a day earlier, the market had jumped 4 to 5% on the promise of just this kind of rate cut. So it's a little bit unusual. I spoke to the chief economist at LendingTree, Tendayi Kapfidze. And he just thinks the Fed missed the mark. This is not the kind of medicine the economy needs to deal with the coronavirus epidemic.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nTENDAYI KAPFIDZE: I don't see that a rate cut makes me want to get on a plane or go to a sports stadium or any other kind of economic activity that increases my risk of infections.\\n\\nHORSLEY: Now, futures markets are pointing to the possibility of a rebound on Wall Street today, so there may be some reassessment. Although that may also reflect investors' attitudes about yesterday's Super Tuesday results.\\n\\nMARTIN: Right. So as you have pointed out, there are limits to what monetary policy can do when it comes to something like a public health crisis like the coronavirus. Is there another option for governments to employ?\\n\\nHORSLEY: There is. For example, South Korea is asking for just money to help businesses that are adversely affected by the epidemic. President Trump has been talking about a payroll tax holiday, which was something that was done during the recession. But there's been little follow-up on that from the White House and almost no talk about it on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley for us. Thank you, Scott. We appreciate it.\\n\\nHORSLEY: You're welcome.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nMARTIN: And now some news from the world of medicine.\\n\\nKING: Yeah. For the first time ever, doctors have used a revolutionary gene-editing technique. They're trying to treat a patient by editing that patient's DNA while it is still inside the person's body.\\n\\nMARTIN: We've got NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with us to explain. Hi, Rob.\\n\\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\\n\\nMARTIN: This sounds crazy. Scientists edited someone's DNA from inside their body.\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah.\\n\\nMARTIN: Explain. What does that mean?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah. Well, they have literally genetically modified someone from the inside. And here's what I mean. Scientists - you know, they've been using a tool called CRISPR to rewrite the genetic code, you know, to try to treat diseases like cancer and sickle cell.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah.\\n\\nSTEIN: But until now, doctors have been taking cells out of the bodies - you know, cells like bone marrow cells - editing the DNA in the cells and then infusing the genetically modified cells back in.\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nSTEIN: Now, for the first time, they've tried this entirely new strategy to try to treat someone with a rare genetic disease that destroys their vision.\\n\\nMARTIN: That is amazing. So what happened? I mean, can you explain in layman's terms what they did?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah, yeah. It's really fascinating. You know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this CRISPR gene-editing tool inside the retina. The CRISPR then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. Here's Eric Pierce. He's the Harvard doctor running this study.\\n\\nERIC PIERCE: If we can fix the underlying genetic defect, we have the potential to restore vision to people who never had normal vision before. It would indeed be amazing.\\n\\nMARTIN: That's phenomenal. So this is a person who couldn't see - hopefully that their vision is going to be restored. What happens now, Rob?\\n\\nSTEIN: They just did this procedure at the Casey Eye Institute. It's at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. And it's on the first volunteer, first study that's testing this. So the first thing the doctors and the scientists are looking for is, you know, whether it's safe. Remember; you know, nothing like this has ever been done before. So they're starting with a very low dose in an older patient who already had extensive vision damage. And they're only treating one eye. And this is all, you know, just to make sure it doesn't backfire somehow, end up destroying whatever vision they do have instead of helping them.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah.\\n\\nSTEIN: But the scientists say this patient could start to see better within, you know, maybe just a few weeks. So doctors are going to be watching really closely both for any problems and for any improvements before trying this on more patients.\\n\\nMARTIN: And obviously paying attention because if it works, I assume it's going to have effects, implications for other diseases, right?\\n\\nSTEIN: Yeah. That's right. That's one of the reasons scientists are so excited about this. You know, there are many other diseases where you really can't treat them by taking cells out of their body and editing them and putting them back in. And the only way to get to the cells that need to be fixed, you know, for brain diseases like Huntington's disease, maybe some inherited forms of dementia, muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy, is to edit from the inside instead of from the outside.\\n\\nMARTIN: Yeah.\\n\\nSTEIN: This is what Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health said about all this.\\n\\nFRANCIS COLLINS: All of us dream of what time might be coming, where we could apply this approach for thousands of diseases.\\n\\nSTEIN: He said it's really exciting, and he's looking forward to see what happens next.\\n\\nMARTIN: Wow. The implications could be huge. NPR's Rob Stein for us this morning. Thank you, Rob. We appreciate it.\\n\\nSTEIN: No problem.\\n\\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly say that the Federal Reserve cut rates this week for the first time outside of a scheduled meeting.

{"original": "Republican Rep. Don Young Sees A 'Road Back To Greatness'\\n\\nRep. Don Young of Alaska has had a pretty good year. He talks with NPR's Michel Martin about his role in getting the new tax bill passed and opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nWe've been talking about the government shutdown which comes on the anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration as president. Thousands of people took to the streets today as they did a year ago in women's marches in cities like New York, Houston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and here in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hey, hey. Ho (ph), ho. Donald Trump has got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho.\\n\\nMARTIN: To mark this day, we wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on President Trump's first year in office, speaking to people on both sides of the aisle about the president's legacy and lasting imprint so far. Earlier in the week, before the shutdown took effect, I spoke with two members of Congress about the president's first year in office. We start with Republican Don Young of Alaska, the so-called dean of the House. That's a title reserved for the longest-serving representative. It's been 45 years in Congressman Young's case. We went to his office on Capitol Hill, and I asked him for his take on Donald Trump's first year.\\n\\nDON YOUNG: Well, President Trump's year has been probably more exciting. One thing though I have to stress that I've always said I don't care who the president is, the job of the Congress is to lead this nation. We've lost that over the years since 1935, when we started transferring power to the president and to the executive branch. Most people are controlled by regulatory law, not legislative law. But overall, for Alaska, with Secretary Zinke, we've undone a lot of what the presidents in the past have done. And I think it gives us more freedom and a chance to take it and improve our nation's and our state's economic bases.\\n\\nMARTIN: So let's talk a little bit about productivity. I mean, the president has talked and tweeted about a lot of legislative accomplishments, but really, there's only been one - the tax bill. Do you consider this a productive first year?\\n\\nYOUNG: Well, I do because that's not the only one. You know, the CRAs - I think there's 11 of those - which are very, very important undoing other laws. And you've got to remember...\\n\\nMARTIN: You mean regulatory actions or executive orders?\\n\\nYOUNG: Executive orders, regulatory actions that were unconstitutional and, very frankly, that we had to do it because otherwise they could undo it. And it could have been done again by another president in the future. So I think that site is very productive. And you look at the stock market where it was before, where it is now. And general attitude, regardless of what you in the media may think, the general attitude in the public's arena think that this country is on the road back to greatness again.\\n\\nMARTIN: Last year, legislation passed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, which is something that has been a goal of yours - if I have this right - for your entire career.\\n\\nYOUNG: Not entire, 37-and-a-half years.\\n\\nMARTIN: Thirty-seven-and-a-half years, I stand corrected.\\n\\nYOUNG: That's right. But that's a pretty good close deal.\\n\\nMARTIN: It was attached to the tax bill, which was controversial. You were part of the reconciliation committee to reach agreement between the House and Senate versions of the bill. And I just have to ask you how it felt when it finally passed after you've had this goal for so long?\\n\\nYOUNG: Well, it was a happy feeling. I have to say that because I, you know, I've argued this so long that I knew I was correct. And my M.O. is - and I've said it many times - that perseverance overcomes intelligence any day of the year. If you decide to do something, you can get it done if you stick with it.\\n\\nMARTIN: So let's talk about the politics of the moment, particularly as somebody who's been here for a long time and has seen a lot of - has served him a lot of people in a lot of different environments. I mean, there are some people who call the atmosphere up here toxic. Do you think that's true? Do you use that word?\\n\\nYOUNG: It's not toxic in the sense that it's toxic because we're not getting things done. The chairman used to run the Congress, not the president, not the speaker. Now, everything's run through Nancy's office or run through Ryan's office. And in doing so, it becomes a party policy instead of solving a problem. There is no problem that's a Republican problem or a Democrat problem or a progressive problem, depends on what you want to call them. But there is a problem, and no one can solve it 100 percent their way. They have to do it together or it'll never get solved. And what's happened now, it has to be 100 percent Republican or 100 percent Democrat. No wants to sit down and say, OK, well, how can we solve the problem? You have to give up a little bit. I have to give up a little bit. The problem's solved.\\n\\nMARTIN: I was going to ask you about that because you've got big pieces of legislation only being passed by one side. Is this the new normal?\\n\\nYOUNG: Well, I can't say it's the new normal forever because it may change. Right now, it's normal. And it was a - it's a, again, a result, I think - and I'm very critical of the media because we do not get news anymore. We get opinions. It's opinionated information. And so they don't really look or read or understand that there is another side to the issue. And again, we are a reflection - the Congress is a reflection of the people they represent. That's all we are. And if the public has this feeling we can't work together, the Congress is not going to work together.\\n\\nMARTIN: And what about President Trump's role in this? Do you think he has a role in this? Some people see him as the symptom. Some people see him as the cause. How do you see him?\\n\\nYOUNG: Well, I see him as an individual that, very frankly, would make me a lot happier if he didn't tweet or Twitter or whatever you call that. I don't do that, by the way. So, you know, I don't know. I think, very frankly, he's doing a great job. He was not my candidate. He knows that. But he's my president. I'm not going to try to crucify him for every little thing he says.\\n\\nMARTIN: That's Congressman Don Young, the dean of the House. He was kind enough to host us in his office on Capitol Hill. Congressman Young, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nYOUNG: My pleasure. Good to have you here.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Syria Systematically Harasses Medical Aid Convoys\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mouneb Taim /Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Mouneb Taim /Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nAmid suspected chemical attacks and shelling, medics treating nearly any injury in a conflict zone in Syria need supplies like anesthetics, IV catheters, syringes and sterile surgical gloves.\\n\\nThese items are routinely included in humanitarian aid shipments. But in February, they were among the 3,810 medical treatments that Syrian authorities removed from aid convoys headed to Nashabiyah, a city in Ghouta, according to the U.N. Security Council.\\n\\nThese convoys are systematically stripped of certain types of medical supplies, says Linda Tom, a Damascus-based spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\\n\\nIt's part of the Syrian government's larger strategy to control the flow of aid to conflict zones. In addition to repeatedly removing essential medical items from aid trucks at checkpoints, Syrian authorities require humanitarian groups to plod through a long bureaucratic process before trucks can even depart.\\n\\nShipments between areas of government control and non-government control require formal approval from the Syrian government — which means conflict zones may not receive aid for weeks or even months.\\n\\nPreventing rebel fighters from getting life-saving supplies is part of the government's military strategy, says Nathanael Chouraqui, a lead Middle East researcher at Iguacu, a nonprofit that studies humanitarian crises and charities. So manipulating aid shipments is a tool, he says. They want to control what, so to speak, the enemy gets.\\n\\nAid deliveries aren't intended to be politicized. They're meant to help anyone who needs assistance, Tom says.\\n\\nHer group coordinates shipments from U.N. convoys, which bring together items from agencies like the World Health Organization and the World Food Programme.\\n\\nAs a result of the Syrian government's administrative process, scores of aid, like basic medical supplies, food and clothing, are seized by authorities or sitting unused in U.N. warehouses in Syria and neighboring countries like Jordan and Turkey, says Tom.\\n\\nThat's not to say that aid isn't being delivered. Aid convoys that don't cross conflict lines have been able to continue. Deliveries from the World Food Programme reached 2 million people in February, for example.\\n\\nIt's more challenging to drive trucks of aid to conflict zones. The U.N. estimates that 2 million people are still trapped in hard-to-reach areas, like Douma, the city that sustained an alleged chemical attack over the weekend.\\n\\nTo travel into these places within Syria, the U.N. and its partners must specify exactly where trucks will go and what supplies will arrive far ahead of their departures. These convoys [heading to besieged areas], they're planned weeks in advance, Tom says. UNOCHA, for example, is currently planning the shipments it will propose to Syrian authorities for May and June.\\n\\nInitial government permissions are only the first step. After that, there's close to a dozen steps that follow, Tom says. The U.N. coordinates with the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, a relief group, to finalize routes and loading lists specifying hundreds of items.\\n\\nFrom his work with humanitarian organizations in Syria and surrounding countries, Chouraqui says that the process often involves negotiation over details like which healthcare supplies are shipped. The priority for the government is strategy, not civilians' welfare, he says. What is discussed at these negotiating tables is rarely for the good of the people and the severity of their needs.\\n\\nEven with government approval, Tom says, healthcare items like insulin and surgical kits are especially at risk of being seized or denied transport.\\n\\nThat was the case on March 5, when 46 trucks ferried food for thousands of people into eastern Ghouta. The Syrian government removed the majority of medical supplies before permitting trucks to travel.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization was allowed to retain these medical supplies for use later. Tom says there's usually not an apparent justification for halting these items' transport.\\n\\nChouraqui says that in other cases, when militias remove those [medical] supplies they tend to use them for themselves.\\n\\nShortages of supplies make it harder for medics to treat patients, especially in besieged areas. We are depending on the convoys, and the pressure of the international community [for medical supplies], says Dr. Rami Al Rayes, who directs Alameen, a nonprofit that works to provide health care and education in Syria, based in Gaziantep, Turkey.\\n\\nAl Rayes points out that doctors in areas under attack need medical items for trauma injuries, like saline solution, anesthesia and antibiotics. In many cases, lack of supplies, facilities and doctors means that evacuating a patient to a better-supplied hospital in another city is the best option, he says. But that transport depends on government approval, too.\\n\\nWithout access to aid, doctors are forced to make do with what's available, says James Denselow, head of conflict and humanitarian policy advocacy at Save the Children.\\n\\nThat might mean using equipment designed for children on adults, or reusing disposable items, Denselow says. Save the Children partners reported that medics have reused bandages and needles in times of short supply.\\n\\nDespite the complexity of accessing these areas and providing enough supplies, UNOCHA continues trying to transport aid to as many people as possible throughout Syria, including more remote places like rural Damascus, Homs and Deir ez-Zor, Tom says.\\n\\nEvery time we're requesting [access from the Syrian government] to reach hard-to-reach areas, she says, we put all the areas on the request."}
{"original": "Remembering Kofi Annan\\n\\nKofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations, has died at age 80. Colum Lynch of Foreign Policy talks with NPR's Jennifer Ludden.\\n\\nJENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST:\\n\\nFormer U.N. secretary-general and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Kofi Annan has died at the age of 80. Annan was from Ghana, the first black African to become the world's top diplomat. He spent most of his career at the U.N. and was the first to rise to the top spot from within the organization's ranks. During his tenure, the U.N. faced one of its most turbulent periods, including the Iraq War. But he also focused the organization on peacekeeping and combating HIV/AIDS.\\n\\nJoining us now is Colum Lynch, a senior diplomatic reporter with Foreign Policy magazine. Welcome.\\n\\nCOLUM LYNCH: Hello. Thanks for having me, Jennifer.\\n\\nLUDDEN: Kofi Annan served two terms as secretary-general, and you covered him during that time.\\n\\nLYNCH: Yes.\\n\\nLUDDEN: What is your most striking memory of him?\\n\\nLYNCH: The most striking memory - I mean, I think that - you mentioned the Iraq War. That was, you know, particularly sort of dramatic in the sense that he had worked quite strenuously to get the United States not to intervene in 2003 and was unsuccessful. And afterwards, you know, came out and challenged the Americans on the decision and has declared that, in his view, he found the U.S. intervention illegal.\\n\\nAnd that was something that I think was very risky diplomatically and probably had a very powerful impact on his ability to run the U.N. after that. It really set him up against, you know, a conservative administration that, I think, held that against him for years and used that as a kind of lever later to try him for some - I mean, among some conservatives in Congress, to try and push him out of the job.\\n\\nLUDDEN: So beyond that troubled relationship, what do you think was his lasting legacy at the U.N.?\\n\\nLYNCH: Well, I think that he was - part of it is style. I mean, he just came across as, you know, this sort of natural kind of international statesman. He wore these sort of impeccable suits from Brioni. I remember he was sort of pushed by one of his aides to sort of improve his style when he became secretary-general and took him to Brioni.\\n\\nLUDDEN: (Laughter) Really? What was his style before that?\\n\\nLYNCH: Well, I think he just wore, like, nice suits. But weren't - you know, wasn't like, you know - if you ever saw Kofi Annan when he was secretary-general, I mean, there was never a wrinkle on his suits or shirts. I mean, he always looked perfect. So but - and he was, like, the classic sort of movie U.N. secretary-general. He always looked the part.\\n\\nHe was very sort of articulate, very even-tempered, always looking for ways to try and mediate conflicts. I mean, he later, after secretary-general - he devoted a lot of his life to doing what, you know, he was experienced in doing, which was peacemaking.\\n\\nLUDDEN: I read that he called himself a stubborn optimist and was kind of known for offering comfort to colleagues who just got really frustrated.\\n\\nLYNCH: If you're a diplomat, you know, I mean, you shouldn't even be in the game if you're not somewhat optimistic because you always are sort of undertaking - particularly if you're a secretary-general, you know, you have limited power, right? And you have to convince countries that have real power to do things that they feel are not in their interest.\\n\\nAnd so he always approached things with a certain sense of - this may seem impossible, but it's really - you know, it's his job to try and - you know, to try and mediate between sort of opposing poles. So I think that that would probably sort of characterize how he went about it.\\n\\nLUDDEN: Colum Lynch, senior diplomatic reporter with Foreign Policy magazine, thank you.\\n\\nLYNCH: All right.

{"original": "'Punishment Without Crime' Highlights The Injustice Of America's Misdemeanor System\\n\\nFormer federal public defender Alexandra Natapoff says 13 million misdemeanors are filed each year in the U.S., trapping the innocent, punishing the poor and making society more unequal.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about a part of the criminal justice system that my guest describes as trapping the innocent and making America more unequal - the massive misdemeanor system. Depending on where you are, some misdemeanors are as minor as jaywalking. But the consequences of being charged with a misdemeanor, whether you are guilty or not, can be life-changing, especially if you are poor. My guest, Alexandra Natapoff, is the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime. Critics of how the criminal justice system deals with misdemeanors have described it as assembly line justice or McJustice.\\n\\nNatapoff is a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. From 2000 to 2003, she was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. She drew on those experiences for the book, but it's also based on extensive data she collected from every state around the country and on interviews with people who've gone through the misdemeanor process, as well as police, prosecutors, public defenders and judges.\\n\\nAlexandra Natapoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a precedent-setting case from 1997 in which a mother was driving with her 3 and 5-year-old children in the car, and she was arrested for a seatbelt violation. Describe what she was arrested for.\\n\\nALEXANDRA NATAPOFF: Gail Atwater and her kids were driving around their local park very slowly - about 15 miles an hour. Her child, Mac, had lost his toy and the kids were looking out the window of their truck to try to find the toy. And they didn't have their seatbelt on. Their mom had told them they could take their seatbelts off in order to see out the windows to look for the toy.\\n\\nAnd they were stopped by a police officer, Turek, who pulled them over and hollered at Gail Atwater that she would be arrested for the seatbelt violation for not having her children in the seatbelt restraints. Her children started to cry. Ms. Atwater asked if she could take her kids to the neighbor's house. Officer Turek said, no, they're going to come to jail with you. A neighbor happened to walk by and take care of the kids, but Gail Atwater went to jail.\\n\\nShe was booked, fingerprinted, spent a couple hours in the lockup and eventually pled guilty to and paid the fine for the seatbelt violation. The most she could have been punished for that violation was $50. It's a traffic misdemeanor. She could not have gone to jail for the seatbelt violation, but nevertheless spent time in jail as a result of the arrest.\\n\\nAnd she brought a lawsuit. She asked the Supreme Court to hold that it's unreasonable for police officers to effectuate what we call full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, lock someone up, book them, take them to jail for a crime like hers, for which she could not have gone to jail. It was a fine-only traffic offense. And the Supreme Court ruled against her.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court said no matter what the crime, no matter how minor the misdemeanor, no matter what the ultimate punishment is, even if you can't be incarcerated for it, the police have the power to effectuate a full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, take you to jail, book you, lock you up.\\n\\nAnd it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.\\n\\nGROSS: So how long was she in jail?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: Gail Atwater spent a few hours that day in jail. She was booked. They took her personal possessions. She was fingerprinted. She spent the time in the lockup as anybody would if they were arrested for any offense in that jurisdiction.\\n\\nSo although I don't know who Gail Atwater spent her afternoon with in the lockup, it's possible that anyone in her situation could have spent the afternoon with people accused of very serious crimes, violent offenders, people with mental health or substance abuse issues. And she had an arrest record, so her information now is in the booking system. And it's an arrest record that will follow her for the rest of her life.\\n\\nGROSS: When you say she had a record, this is her record. She didn't have one before this.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: Correct.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. So let's talk more about what a misdemeanor is. Not having your children wear seatbelts - that's a misdemeanor. But there's a wide range of crimes that qualify as misdemeanors. Can you give us a sense of that range?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.\\n\\nMany jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.\\n\\nGROSS: So your book is, in part, about the inequality of the misdemeanor system and how it's racially unequal and there's a class system within the misdemeanor system. So I don't know what kind of income the woman who was arrested for the seatbelt violation had, but what are the differences in how that might've been handled between a person who had money and a person who didn't?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: One of the startling things about our enormous misdemeanor system is just how unequal it is. It often goes after low income and impoverished individuals. It sweeps in people of color, often disproportionately, for order maintenance and other low-level offenses. One of the particularly burdensome and inegalitarian aspects of low-level offenses is the effect of imposing fines and fees on misdemeanor defendants.\\n\\nSo Gail Atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. And for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.\\n\\nJurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.\\n\\nIt can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. If they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. They may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. So now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.\\n\\nSo there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.\\n\\nGROSS: Let's talk about bail. I mean, what is the purpose of bail, and how do you think it's being misused now?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: The purpose of bail is supposed to be to ensure that people appear for court when they're charged with an offense. When people are charged with an offense, they're, of course, presumptively innocent. They haven't been convicted of anything. So bail has nothing to do with whether anyone is guilty or innocent. It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.\\n\\nBut what has happened in the misdemeanor system is that bail has morphed into a tool for raising money, for extracting fines and fees from individuals and has contributed to a sort of misdemeanor version of mass incarceration. Many jurisdictions have bail schedules, a set list of fees for various low-level offenses.\\n\\nSo if you're charged with trespassing, your bail is automatically $500. If you're charged with marijuana possession, your bail is automatically $1,000. These amounts have nothing to do with whether this particular individual is a flight risk, whether they're dangerous. Rather, they're just set schedules.\\n\\nAnd for many people, those bail fees are out of reach. And so they remain incarcerated because they can't pay. And so we've seen around the country - many jails are filled with individuals who are there not because they've done anything particularly wrong or pose any particular threat or even a risk of flight but simply because they can't afford to pay bail.\\n\\nGROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL SIMON SONG, HOW CAN YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHEAST?)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\\n\\nYou mentioned that fees and fines are used to fund things. And by things, do you mean, like, to fund cities and counties and municipalities - that those funds go into funding the system? So in that sense, kind of like traffic tickets, they're an important part of fundraising for the budget.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: And misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. They fund courts. They fund probation offices. They fund public defender offices. They fund prosecutor offices. Some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. It's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. It's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.\\n\\nOur criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. We need it to go after dangerous people. We need it for deterrence and for public safety. And yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. Whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.\\n\\nGROSS: I think, for some areas, the police are expected to - or may be required to - pull over a certain number of people per month. Like, there's a quota. And I'm wondering if you think that contributes to problems within the misdemeanor system.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: We've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.\\n\\nThere have been lawsuits in New York from police officers that, when they are assigned to low-income communities of color, under pressure from these quotas, they feel forced to contribute to the racial disproportion of the criminal system - that in essence, because they've been assigned to communities of color, that they have to issue citations, that they have to engage in arrests, even when some other police action or some other intervention might be more appropriate.\\n\\nAnd it is a distortion of the police function. Police discretion is an extraordinarily important resource in the criminal system. We rely on police discretion to advance public safety, to make sure people are treated fairly. And when we put pressure on police officers to produce citations and low-level arrests when they might not otherwise exercise their discretion that way, we're really interfering with a key aspect of the system's integrity.\\n\\nGROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: I learned an enormous amount from the people that I represented in Baltimore - listening to their stories, meeting them and their families and hearing how they grappled with the challenges of facing a low-level misdemeanor charge. And I learned that often the calculus of punishment doesn't necessarily shake out the way you would think.\\n\\nThere might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.\\n\\nMany of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.\\n\\nGROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing. So what are the consequences of that?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: The lack of resources in the misdemeanor system is one of the great challenges to the integrity of that process. And the reason that there's a lack of time is because the case loads are so enormous. There are so many people coming in to the misdemeanor system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed every year in this country. That's 80 percent of American criminal dockets.\\n\\nAnd so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along. For public defenders in particular, having hundreds, sometimes thousands of cases that they have to resolve means that they don't have time to talk to their clients.\\n\\nThey may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.\\n\\nThe lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.\\n\\nThe lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.\\n\\nWe've seen around the country examples of judges who actually punish public defenders when they try to litigate issues on behalf of their clients when they want to go to trial, when they want to file a motion. Judges have been known to hold public defenders in contempt or threaten to hold them in contempt because they're holding up the docket.\\n\\nAnd so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll talk more after a break, and Lloyd Schwartz will review a new recording of Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale made by Roger Waters, co-founder of the rock band Pink Floyd. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ANTONIO SANCHEZ AND BRAD MEHLDAU AND MATT BREWER'S NAR-THIS)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's a professor of law at the University of California Irvine and, before that, was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.\\n\\nYou mentioned that part of the misdemeanor system is often referred to as meet them and plead them, so, you know, lawyers encourage - often encourage their clients to just like plead guilty and get it done with. So if you decide to take the conviction and you take the plea, what are the consequences of that? Now you have a record.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So one of the great fallacies of the misdemeanor universe is that getting a misdemeanor is no big deal, that it's just a misdemeanor, that it won't dog you for your life. And that has come to be, you know, profoundly untrue. A misdemeanor conviction, although of course not as serious as a felony conviction, still imposes enormous burdens on the people who carry them.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nWe know that it interferes with employment. It can mean that they lose welfare benefits, become ineligible for financial aid for education. They can lose their housing. It can threaten their immigration status. It can disqualify them for all kinds of jobs and licenses.\\n\\nSo the consequences of a misdemeanor conviction are far from petty, even though the conversation around misdemeanors, you know, really doesn't appreciate the impact that they impose.\\n\\nGROSS: So we've talked a little bit about how the misdemeanor system penalizes the poor more than people who have money because the poor can't afford to pay bail or fines or fees. What are the fees that you're referring to?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.\\n\\nSo their fees can include jail fees, supervision fees, fees for applying for the public defender, fees for using the public defender, fees for drug testing, fees when they swab your cheek to put your DNA in the database. They'll charge you a fee if you don't show up to court, and they issue a warrant, they'll issue a fee. If you're late paying your fees, they'll charge you a fee.\\n\\nIn many jurisdictions, the list of fees, ranging from a few dollars here to $10, $20, $30 or a hundred dollars there, can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars on top of whatever punitive fine the court decides to impose.\\n\\nGROSS: So wait a minute. You're charged a fee for paying - paying for your own incarceration in jail. And you're charged a fee to have a public defender and - when the whole idea of having a public defender is that it's a free lawyer to represent you.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: I think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. One of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. Of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. So if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.\\n\\nJail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.\\n\\nGROSS: So I just want to make sure - I know a lot of our listeners are probably thinking, is this person arguing that misdemeanors should not be punished or that there shouldn't be misdemeanors or that everybody should just be left alone - no jail, no fees or fines or bail? So what are you arguing for? I mean, you want reform, but you're not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.\\n\\nWe need to dial back this enormous, bloated misdemeanor system. We need to dial back arrests. We need to dial back incarceration. We need to dial back the penalties and the use of debtors' prison so that the misdemeanor system can do its job, so that it can go after crime and low-level offenses in a meaningful way and impose punishments that are not so wildly disproportionate to the crime.\\n\\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\\n\\nWhat are a couple of the reforms you would like to see in the misdemeanor system?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.\\n\\nAnd prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. It was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. There are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.\\n\\nGROSS: Are you convinced that that would not encourage people to break laws because there wouldn't be consequences or at least there wouldn't be consequences as great as there are today.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.\\n\\nThey're caught up in a system that's using misdemeanor arrest and using misdemeanor processing in unfair and dysfunctional ways. And I think there is a lot of room in our misdemeanor system to scale back those practices so that we can concentrate on misdemeanors that cause real harm - the drunk driving and the assaults and the domestic violence that require our attention and make our misdemeanor system more truly effective and a better deterrent.\\n\\nGROSS: I want to switch topics to an earlier book that you wrote, a 2009 book called Snitching: Criminal Informants And The Erosion Of American Justice. And this book was about the government's use of criminal suspects and criminal defendants to get information in exchange for deals to get, you know, somebody to talk or to, you know, name another person who is guilty of something in return for leniency for the informant's crimes. What do you think is the problem with that kind of approach?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: The problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the American criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. It's essentially a market. Ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. They're not a result of a trial. We almost never litigate guilt anymore.\\n\\nAnd so within this market, we've created a kind of a black market, if you will, of cooperation, of deals between the government and individuals who are suspect or who have committed a crime in which guilt and information and cooperation are traded, often off the record, informally, without constraint.\\n\\nAnd so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses. Often, individual - vulnerable individuals are pressured into becoming informants at great risk to their lives. The government can launder a lot of its mistakes through cooperation and through the plea-bargaining process. So it's an opaque, under-regulated aspect of a market that is all - that hasn't gotten enough attention.\\n\\nGROSS: I know you're also concerned that somebody who is bargaining for leniency in return for information isn't necessarily telling the truth.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So there's some big, famous problems with the use of criminal informants. One is wrongful conviction. Informants often lie in order to get a deal. Informants also often continue to commit their own crimes. They get a kind of impunity from cooperating with the government. A lot of it is very secretive, so it's a kind of off-the-record aspect - big off-the-record aspect of the criminal justice system.\\n\\nAnd all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal. It's that for such an important public policy, we should know more about it. The government should be more accountable. These cases should be better scrutinized.\\n\\nGROSS: So in light of what you just told us about what you describe as snitching, what do you think of the use of giving information in return for a more lenient sentence as is being done by the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York in investigating the Trump administration?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.\\n\\nThe kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.\\n\\nGROSS: As good as we get, but do you think it's justified?\\n\\nNATAPOFF: I think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. And that's a matter for democratic debate. We will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. And then the American public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.\\n\\nI'm not against the use of criminal informant deals in a system where we have already made the decision to negotiate. We live in a world of plea bargaining. And sometimes, it's worth cutting a deal with a terrible person in order to advance public safety and advance justice.\\n\\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff, thank you so much for talking with us.\\n\\nNATAPOFF: Thanks so much for having me.\\n\\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime.

{"original": "When Biden Takes Office, Undoing Trump's Health Policies Won't Be Easy\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nEven with Democrats technically in the majority in Congress, the party split is so slim that passing major health care legislation will be extremely difficult.\\n\\nSo speculation about President-elect Joe Biden's health agenda has focused on the things he can accomplish using executive authority. Although there is a long list of things he could do, even longer is the list of things he is being urged to undo — actions taken by President Trump.\\n\\nWhile Trump was not able to make good on his highest-profile health-related promises from his 2016 campaign — including repealing the Affordable Care Act and broadly lowering prescription drug prices — his administration did make substantial changes to the nation's health care system using executive branch authority. And many of those changes are anathema to Democrats, particularly those aimed at hobbling the ACA.\\n\\nFor example, the Trump administration made it easier for those who buy their own insurance to purchase cheaper plans that don't cover all the ACA benefits and may not cover pre-existing conditions. It also eliminated protections from discrimination in health care to people who are transgender.\\n\\nTrump's use of tools like regulations, guidance and executive orders to modify health programs was like an attack by a thousand paper cuts, said Maura Calsyn, managing director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. Approaching the November election, she said, the administration was in the process of doing irreparable harm to the nation's health care system.\\n\\nReversing many of those changes will be a big part of Biden's health agenda, in many cases coming even before trying to act on his own campaign pledges, such as creating a government-sponsored health plan as part of the ACA.\\n\\nChris Jennings, a health aide to former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, said he refers to those Trump health policies as bird droppings. As in you have to clean up the bird droppings before you have a clean slate. Republicans, when they take over from a Democratic administration, think of their predecessors' policies the same way.\\n\\nThough changing policies made by the executive branch seems easy, that's not always the case.\\n\\nThese are issue-by-issue determinations that must be made, and they require process evaluation, legal evaluation, resource consideration and timeliness, said Jennings. In other words, some policies will take more time and personnel resources than others. And health policies will have to compete for White House attention with policies the new administration will want to change on anything from the environment to immigration to education.\\n\\nEven within health care, issues as diverse as the operations of the ACA marketplaces to women's reproductive health to stem cell research will vie to be high on the list.\\n\\nWhy the changes are hard to reverse\\n\\nSome types of actions are easier to reverse than others.\\n\\nExecutive orders issued by the president, for example, can be summarily overturned by a new executive order. Agency guidance can similarly be written over, although the Trump administration has worked to make that more onerous.\\n\\nSince the 1980s, for example, every time the presidency has changed parties, one of the incoming president's first actions has been to issue an executive order to either reimpose or eliminate the Mexico City Policy that governs funding for international family planning organizations that perform or promote abortion. Why do new administrations address abortion so quickly? Because the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v. Wade is two days after Inauguration Day, so the action is always politically timely.\\n\\nHarder to change are formal regulations, such as one effectively banning Planned Parenthood from the federal family planning program, Title X. They are governed by a law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that lays out a very specific — and often time-consuming — process. You have to cross your i's and dot your legal t's, said Nicholas Bagley, who teaches administrative law at the University of Michigan Law School.\\n\\nAnd if you don't? Then regulations can be challenged in court — as those of the Trump administration were dozens of times. That's something Biden officials will take pains to avoid, said Calsyn. I would expect to see very deliberate notice and comment rule-making, considering the reshaped judiciary with so many Trump-appointed judges, she said.\\n\\nWhat comes first?\\n\\nUndoing a previous administration's actions in a new administration is an exercise in trying to push many things through a very narrow tube in a short time. Department regulations have to go not just through the leadership in each department, but also through the Office of Management and Budget for a technical review, cost-benefit analysis and legal authority, said Bagley. That can take time.\\n\\nComplicating matters, many health regulations emanate not just from the Department of Health and Human Services, but jointly from HHS and other departments, including Labor and Treasury, which likely means more time to negotiate decisions among multiple departments.\\n\\nFinally, said Bagley, for really high-profile things, you've got to get the president's attention, and he's got limited time, too. Anything pandemic-related is likely to come first, he said.\\n\\nSome items get pushed to the front of the line due to calendar considerations, as with the abortion executive orders. Others need more immediate attention because they are part of active court cases.\\n\\nYou have all these court schedules and briefing schedules that will dictate the timeline where they make all these decisions, said Katie Keith, a health policy researcher and law professor at Georgetown University.\\n\\nA high-profile example in that category is the Trump administration's efforts to allow states to set work requirements for many low-income adults who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging HHS approval of work requirements for Arkansas and New Hampshire in the next few months. Some Democrats are concerned about how the high court with its new conservative majority might rule, and the Biden administration will have to move fast if officials decide they want to head off that case.\\n\\nBut court actions also might help the Biden administration short-circuit the onerous regulatory process. If a regulation the new administration wants to rewrite or repeal has already been blocked by a court, Biden officials can simply choose not to appeal that ruling. That's what Trump did in ending insurance company subsidies for enrollees with low incomes in 2017.\\n\\nAllowing a lower-court ruling to stand, however, is not a foolproof strategy. That raises the possibility of having someone [else] intervene, said Keith. For example, Democratic attorneys general stepped in to defend the ACA in a case now pending at the Supreme Court when the Trump administration chose not to. So, you have to be pretty strategic about not appealing, she said.\\n\\nAdding on?\\n\\nOne other big decision for the incoming administration is whether it wants to use the opportunity to tweak or add to Trump policies rather than eliminate them. Is it undoing and full stop? asked Keith. Or undoing and adding on?\\n\\nShe said there is a full slate of ideologically neutral policies Trump put out, including ones on price transparency and prescription drugs. If Biden officials don't want to keep those as they are, they can rewrite them and advance other policies at the same time, saving a round of regulatory effort.\\n\\nBut none of it is easy — or fast.\\n\\nOne big problem is just having enough bodies available to do the work. There was so much that undermined and hollowed out the federal workforce; there's a lot of rebuilding that needs to done, said Calsyn of the Center for American Progress. And Trump officials ran so roughshod over the regulatory process in many cases, she said, even putting those processes back in place is going to be hard.\\n\\nIncoming officials will also have other time-sensitive work to do. Writing regulations for the newly passed ban on surprise medical bills will almost certainly be a giant political fight between insurers and health care providers, who will try to re-litigate the legislation as it is implemented. Rules for insurers who sell policies under the ACA will need to be written almost immediately after Biden takes office.\\n\\nAnyone waiting for a particular Trump policy to be wiped from the books will likely have to pack their patience. But law professor Bagley said he's optimistic it will all get done.\\n\\nOne of the things we've grown unaccustomed to is a competent administration, he said. When people are competent, they can do a lot of things pretty quickly.\\n\\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

{"original": "Math Problem: What's The Best Strategy For COVID-19 Vaccination?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Octavio Jones/Getty Images Octavio Jones/Getty Images\\n\\nOnly a vaccine will save America from the COVID -19 pandemic. At least that's the opinion of nearly all public health officials.\\n\\nObviously, vaccine manufacturers are critical to any vaccine campaign. But there's another group that plays a less obvious but still crucial role in making sure vaccines do what they're intended: mathematicians.\\n\\nEven if the Biden administration releases all available doses of the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines, for a while at least, supplies will remain limited. How best to use that limited supply is a question mathematicians can help answer.\\n\\nMathematical models are very, very useful to guide policy, says Laura Matrajt, a builder of mathematical models at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. They can help with decisions about who gets the vaccine first when supplies are limited.\\n\\nThere are a few factors that really shift how the prioritization would go in a strong way, says Daniel Larremore, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado BioFrontiers Institute. One of those is how much is the virus spreading as the vaccine is being rolled out? And another factor is. How fast is the vaccine being rolled out?\\n\\nIt's also important to know how effective a vaccine is at preventing disease, how long protection lasts, and whether it not only prevents someone from getting sick but also from transmitting COVID-19. Unfortunately, only the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is known, not the other two variables.\\n\\nEven in the face of missing information, modelers can provide some guidance. Larremore says to end a pandemic, it generally makes sense to vaccinate those most capable of spreading disease.\\n\\nHowever, he says, if the vaccine is rolled out slowly, which is currently the case, and if community transmission is high, which is also currently the case, then it becomes better to prioritize adults over 60 to minimize mortality.\\n\\nThis is close to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently recommending, although the CDC guidelines also call for vaccinating people likely to be exposed to the virus, such as front-line health care workers.\\n\\nBut even if a mathematical model suggests the most effective path, it doesn't provide all the answers public health officials need.\\n\\nYou still have to make some difficult value decisions, says Mark Jit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Like how many lives in older people are you going to save, how many lives in younger people are you going to save, how many lives in different people, richer, poorer people. So there are some tricky value decisions, but those are inherent in the fact that we have limited supplies of the vaccine, so we have to make hard decisions about who to give it to first.\\n\\nRight now, modelers are trying to help public health officials decide if it makes sense to use a single dose of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine to extend the limited supply, even though the vaccine has only really been tested using a two-dose regimen.\\n\\nMatrajt of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a model that allows her to test various what if scenarios.\\n\\nIf the first dose is highly efficacious, and we have stringent social distancing interventions in place, then vaccinating with a single dose is optimal, Matrajt says, but the strategy only works if a single dose is efficacious.\\n\\nWe should do whatever it takes to know what the efficacy of a single dose is, she says.\\n\\nWhat's clear from all the models is that rolling out the vaccine as quickly as possible is essential.\\n\\nIf you don't roll out the vaccine fast enough, the effect of the vaccine will be very, very limited, Matrajt says.\\n\\nGerardo Chowell, a mathematical epidemiologist at Georgia State University, puts it even more bluntly. Delays in vaccination, delays in testing, are costing us lives."}
{"original": "Despite The End Of China's One-Child Policy, Births Are Still Lagging\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption VCG/VCG via Getty Images VCG/VCG via Getty Images\\n\\nTwo years after China officially ended its one-child policy in order to counter the country's aging society and shrinking workforce, Chinese couples are not having babies fast enough.\\n\\nIn 2017, there were 17.6 million births in China, representing 12.43 births per thousand people. However, that was a drop from 2016, when the one-child policy was first relaxed – a year that saw 12.95 births per 1,000 people.\\n\\nThe difficulty in quickly turning things around results from the old policy's successes as well as its failures.\\n\\nPromulgated in 1979 by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the one-child policy was an effort to ensure that China's population did not hold back its economic development.\\n\\nBy 2016, China's leadership faced the opposite problem and implemented a two-child policy in hopes of spurring births.\\n\\nThe latest drop in the birth rate, according to demographer Chen Youhua from Nanjing University quoted in The South China Morning Post, is due to a fall in the number of women of childbearing age. There are fewer childbearing women because of the lower birth rates in the 1990s, when the one-child policy was in full swing.\\n\\nBecause of China's strong preference for male children, the one-child policy infamously led to female infanticide, further exacerbated the problem and creating a gender imbalance of an estimated 30 million males, according to Post.\\n\\nThe Council on Foreign Relations writes, The fertility rate still hovers around 1.6, lower than the U.S. rate of 1.87. Even Brazil, which has a similar GDP per capita to China, has a rate of 1.75. Furthermore, Chinese parents have traditionally preferred boys over girls, leading to a massive gender imbalance. In 2017, men outnumbered women by 33 million, and the male to female birth ratio was 115 boys for every 100 girls, one of the most skewed in the world.\\n\\nEven so, there is one bright spot in the statistics: 51 percent of the births in 2017 were to couples who already have a child, proving that many who can have children are eager to have larger families.\\n\\nFor some, though, the idea of having more children could prove a difficult sell. As Bloomberg notes, High living costs, long work hours and surging child-care expenses mean that many couples feel that they can only afford to have one child — or none. A survey by Zhaopin.com, a job recruitment site, found that 33 percent of women had their pay cut after giving birth and 36 percent were demoted."}
{"original": "Millions Own Gas And Oil Under Their Land. Here's Why Only Some Strike It Rich\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Marie Cusick/StateImpact Pennsylvania Marie Cusick/StateImpact Pennsylvania\\n\\nThe U.S. is one of only a few countries in the world that allow private individuals to own the minerals under their land, a policy that dates to the Founding Fathers as they sought to elevate private interests over those of the British Crown. This financial incentive to allow new drilling goes a long way in explaining the nation's natural gas boom. The National Association of Royalty Owners estimates some 12 million American landowners receive royalties for the exploitation of oil, gas and other mineral resources under their property.\\n\\nBut as U.S. production reaches record levels — it recently surpassed the previous high point in 1970 — a complex web of laws and court rulings is evolving over how these royalties are distributed. That's creating vast differences in how much money property owners actually get and prompting a number of lawsuits accusing energy companies of shortchanging them.\\n\\nA tale of two mineral owners\\n\\nThis disparity is playing out across Pennsylvania's gas-rich Marcellus Shale.\\n\\nWhen natural gas companies approached Charlie Clark and Jim Barrett, two farmers living in neighboring counties, both decided to let them drill.\\n\\nClark says it felt like he had won the lottery, and he is grateful every day for the two gas wells drilled on his dairy farm. He estimates he receives about $10,000 per month in the form of gas royalties.\\n\\nThis is what we've done with our gas money, Clark says, standing in his new barn filled with cows. This barn here cost $40,000 to build it, and we were able to build it out of our pocket.\\n\\nWhen he was growing up in rural Susquehanna County in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, his family used to scrimp and save just to buy basics, like new shoes.\\n\\nNow, since the drilling rigs rolled into town and he started receiving royalty checks, Clark has a newfound sense of financial security.\\n\\nWe're living like we used to, but without the stress, Clark says. The bills are all paid. Your kid's gotta go to college? No problem.\\n\\nHe's a good example of when the royalty process works. It goes like this: Gas companies and landowners sign a lease agreement before drilling begins. The royalty is money paid to the mineral owner, like Clark, for the right to use his resource. It's negotiated to be a certain percentage of the revenue from the sale of the gas.\\n\\nClark is leased to a company called Chief Oil and Gas. The company gets gas it needs, and Clark gets paid. But he knows other people with similar gas wells are striking out.\\n\\nI thank God every day that it happened here, he says, and not a few miles to the west.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Marie Cusick/StateImpact Pennsylvania Marie Cusick/StateImpact Pennsylvania\\n\\nStriking out\\n\\nThat's where Jim Barrett lives, about 40 miles away in Bradford County on what he describes as a pretty typical mountain farm.\\n\\nLike Clark, he is grateful for the drilling.\\n\\nIt kept Bradford County alive, he says. If not for the gas industry, he says, his community would have been a ghost town in 2008 or 2010 after the Great Recession.\\n\\nBut for Barrett, the gas boom has not panned out the way he had hoped.\\n\\nHe says Chesapeake Energy, which operates four wells on his farm, is stealing from him, and he has joined a class-action lawsuit against the company. Chesapeake, which declined to comment for this story, is defending itself against lawsuits in at least seven states for allegedly underpaying royalties.\\n\\nBy Barrett's calculations, Chesapeake owes him hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gas it has pumped out of his farm. The company has said in the past that it is committed to working with its royalty owners to answer questions.\\n\\nClark and Barrett might have started out with similar hopes, but their different experiences show how tough it can be for landowners to navigate the gas business and how resolutions are hard to come by.\\n\\nWhy the disparity?\\n\\nMuch of the controversy surrounding royalty money boils down to a concept known as post-production costs: the expenses of moving and treating gas through a network of pipelines. To cover the costs, drillers might take deductions from royalty checks.\\n\\nSome landowners agree to that, while others negotiate a lease that prohibits it, says attorney John McFarland, who represents landowners with the Texas-based law firm Graves, Dougherty, Hearon and Moody. Many others sign leases that don't address it at all. Even when possible deductions are addressed, McFarland says, the lease language can be vague. That leaves room for a gas company to take deductions even if a landowner objects.\\n\\nDisputes over post-production costs have popped up all over the country as oil and gas production has soared, the result of new horizontal drilling and fracking technologies that allow drillers to tap into shale rock.\\n\\nBy 2014, the United States was producing so much oil and gas that it led to a global oversupply. That's when complaints over these deductions really started to roll in, says Gary Preszler, vice president of the National Association of Royalty Owners board.\\n\\nMany energy-producing states took a hit during the downturn, as companies went bankrupt, workers were laid off, and tax revenue collected from oil and gas dropped. In most of them, like North Dakota, where Preszler lives, wells produce both oil and gas. When prices plummeted, oil suddenly wasn't worth what it used to be, he says, but the gas still needed to be transported and treated, and that cost stayed constant.\\n\\nThat's when people saw their checks being reduced significantly, he says. Some even received statements with a negative balance, meaning they wouldn't receive more royalties until the balance turned positive again.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, wells produce mainly gas, so landowners like Barrett noticed right away when companies took out big, unexplained cuts. Some Pennsylvania landowners have been complaining for years about exorbitant deductions. Still, many never have a reason to complain. Clark, for example, says he feels his deductions are reasonable.\\n\\nA patchwork of court rulings, allegations of cheating\\n\\nOver the years, some landowners sued when they felt they were being cheated. That has led to a patchwork of court rulings in many states, determining how leases are interpreted.\\n\\nSome landowners hire a lawyer to negotiate a lease with explicit language that prohibits deductions or spells out exactly which costs can be taken out. The greater stake an individual has in a well, the more bargaining power he or she has to negotiate a lease that works in his or her favor, says University of Texas law professor Owen Anderson.\\n\\nBut not all go that route.\\n\\nAs often happens, these landowners and mineral owners sign these leases the company offers without negotiating terms and without getting legal advice, Anderson says.\\n\\nLater, if they believe they're not getting paid fairly, their options are slim. They can hire an expert to audit their royalties and go to court, but some can't afford to do that.\\n\\nPreszler says the better option is to prevent landowners from signing bad leases.\\n\\nIt's a lot easier to try to get the terms correctly done at the front end than to try to manage and fix a problem later, he says. His group is developing a seminar to better educate landowners.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, a decades-old law guarantees a minimum 12.5 percent royalty. But the state's Supreme Court has ruled that deductions can still be taken, even if they cut into that rate. For four years, mineral owners have pushed to keep that from happening, but so far the Legislature has not passed a bill.\\n\\nIt's a different story in West Virginia, where royalty owners just scored a victory. Lawmakers did step in after the state Supreme Court sided with energy companies in a case last year. Now, the governor has signed a new law prohibiting gas and oil companies from deducting post-production expenses in certain types of leases.\\n\\nMeanwhile, lawsuits are playing out in several states, including one brought by Pennsylvania's attorney general accusing several gas companies of stiffing thousands of landowners by promising royalty money that was never paid. So far, he has not agreed to an offer by Chesapeake Energy to settle its royalty cases in the state for $30 million.\\n\\nBack on his farm in Susquehanna County, Clark says even though he is pleased with his gas royalties, he thinks the law should ensure everyone is paid fairly.\\n\\nI guess I really don't understand why the government hasn't stepped in and done a little bit more, because it would benefit them too, he says. Any extra money we'd get, we'd be taxed on.\\n\\nOver in Bradford County, Barrett just wants to protect his family's legacy. Every farmer would say they want their farm to continue, he says.\\n\\nBarrett's land was passed down from his great-grandfather, and he hopes to hand it over to his grandchildren. But without the royalty money he expected, he and his wife may have to sell the farm to retire."}
{"original": "Logan Act Lingers For Others In Russia Probe, As All Eyes Look Up The Trump Ladder\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated Dec. 1 at 5:01 p.m. ET\\n\\nMichael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty Friday to providing false statements to the FBI. Those are less serious charges than he could have faced, because he is cooperating with special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigators.\\n\\nFlynn likely has something to trade, as NPR's Carrie Johnson noted on All Things Considered Friday. Flynn was not acting alone, according to charging documents against him. In fact, there were multiple members of the presidential transition team who spoke with Flynn about his communications with the Russian ambassador.\\n\\nThat included a very senior member, who directed Flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia ... Several news organizations have identified that individual as Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law.\\n\\nThe Logan Act often comes up in relation to the Russia investigation. Back in February, we noted that Flynn himself could have violated it. But now that Mueller is looking up the food chain, we dug out and refreshed our post explaining what it is, why it matters — and why it is seldom used.\\n\\nWhat is the Logan Act?\\n\\nThe Logan Act states, in part (emphasis ours):\\n\\nAny citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\\n\\nLet's break that down. This is saying that no private person can try to conduct foreign policy without the permission of the U.S. government.\\n\\nSpecifically, that person isn't allowed to talk with a foreign government or its representative and try to influence foreign policy — directly or indirectly.\\n\\nWhen was it put in place and why?\\n\\nIt's named for Dr. George Logan, a Democratic-Republican Party lawmaker from Pennsylvania, who traveled to France in 1798 and negotiated the lifting of an embargo and the release of American sailors held captive in French prisons.\\n\\nHe did so without the permission of President John Adams, though he was a friend of then-Vice President Thomas Jefferson's.\\n\\nIt was after the French Revolution, and the United States didn't help France because of a treaty with England. The French were upset and began robbing passing American ships and jailing its sailors.\\n\\nOfficial Adams administration envoys tried unsuccessfully to settle the unrest with France — and the country appeared tumbling toward war with France. That's when Logan, a Quaker, embarked on his effort.\\n\\nHe succeeded, but when he got back to the U.S., Adams, Washington and others were furious. Congress then acted to bar actions like Logan's from taking place again.\\n\\nHas anyone ever been convicted of violating it?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThis is important, because as often as this law is mentioned, no one has ever gone to jail for it, meaning the likelihood of its being used is pretty slim.\\n\\nWhy hasn't anyone been convicted?\\n\\nOften, the people who get mentioned are people who are in government and seem to defy the sitting president. For example, remember when then-House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress?\\n\\nObama and Netanyahu had an icy relationship because of Israeli settlement expansion. (Ironic considering what the charging documents say Flynn did in trying to get Russia to vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution dealing with that very issue.)\\n\\nSo some people raised the Logan Act and whether Boehner was in violation. Most said no. Here's why, per the Washington Post:\\n\\nThat's partly because the law is vague about which branch of government can give permission for someone to conduct foreign affairs, noted Eugene Volokh with The Volokh Conspiracy blog at The Post in 2015. It could be the executive branch, it could be Congress. It could even be the president telling just one member of Congress to go do something without telling the others. It seems like [there] are so many loopholes and uncertainties, it's hard for prosecutors to peg down how someone violated this law — and even harder for courts to make that determination. But the law is pretty clear that you need to have permission from the government to do something, and it doesn't look like Flynn had permission to talk to Russians about sanctions while the Obama administration was still in power.\\n\\nSo has there ever been an attempt to prosecute someone for it?\\n\\nYes, once someone was indicted.\\n\\nThat was way back in 1803, four years after the law was enacted.\\n\\nAn anonymous column ran in a Kentucky newspaper arguing for A Western America allied with France. The U.S. attorney for Kentucky was an Adams ally and persuaded a grand jury to indict Francis Flournoy, a farmer, who actually wrote the column.\\n\\nBut it never went to trial.\\n\\nLater that year, the Louisiana Purchase, which expanded the United States farther west, made it moot.\\n\\nHow else has the Logan Act been used?\\n\\nMostly as a political weapon.\\n\\nVarious courts have mentioned the Logan Act, according to the Congressional Research Service, but it has mostly been used to try to shame political opponents.\\n\\nFor example, in the 1980s, there was House Speaker Jim Wright's relationship with the Sandinista government in Nicaragua — and Jesse Jackson negotiating in Syria and Cuba for prisoner releases.\\n\\nThat is the law of the land, a frustrated President Ronald Reagan said in an interview in 1984 of the Logan Act and Jackson's efforts.\\n\\nHe added, We are not going to take legal action, but I do feel that while in this instance he was successful, there were things that make you pause and think.\\n\\nOK, that was the 1980s. Has it been mentioned more recently?\\n\\nYes, lots.\\n\\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a trip to Syria and talked about improving U.S.-Syria relations with that government, irritating the White House.\\n\\nFormer President Jimmy Carter also traveled to Syria in 2008 to meet with Hamas about Mideast peace.\\n\\nAs recently as 2015, the act was mentioned again when 47 Republican U.S. senators wrote a letter to Iran downplaying the nuclear deal. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has been rumored to be in line as Trump's next CIA director, penned the letter — and was accused of violating the act.\\n\\nThe potential of a Logan Act violation was raised again when Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii met with Syrian leader Bashar Assad in January of this year, before Trump was sworn in.\\n\\nI wanted to see if there was, in some small way, a way that I could express the love and the aloha and the care that the American people have for the people of Syria, she told CNN.\\n\\nThe Obama administration's official position was regime change in Syria. President Trump has said the U.S. should work with Russia to bring peace in Syria. Russia's policy is to leave Assad in place.\\n\\nCould the very senior member be susceptible?\\n\\nWe noted in February that if Flynn, in any way, reassured the Russian ambassador in his phone conversations or texts that the incoming Trump administration would loosen or drop the sanctions Obama put in place, that could potentially be a violation.\\n\\nThat could be the same for whoever directed Flynn (or whoever directed the person who directed Flynn) if there was reassurance on sanctions.\\n\\nThe charging documents note that:\\n\\nFlynn and the PTT official discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. The PTT official and Flynn also discussed that the members of the Presidential Transition Team at Mar-a-lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.\\n\\nThe charging documents do not make clear what Flynn urged exactly when it came to sanctions — if there was reassurance, for example. But there is a transcript of that call collected by the intelligence community, and presumably Mueller's team has reviewed it.\\n\\nThe White House said in February it was confident Flynn didn't say anything that violated the law.\\n\\nThere was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer contended after Flynn was fired in February.\\n\\nThe White House has not commented since Flynn's guilty plea."}
{"original": "Why Nations Fail, America Edition\\n\\nEditor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\\n\\nEnlarge this image Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nAs we approach Inauguration Day, exactly two weeks after the Capitol insurrection, Americans are on edge. About 20,000 National Guard troops will provide security on Wednesday — more than in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our political situation feels shaky and our institutions fragile. It's like we're living in a bad Tom Clancy novel. We couldn't reach Clancy, so we called up the authors of Why Nations Fail instead. We wanted to figure out if the insurrection is a sign that our nation is failing and, if so, whether there's anything we can do about it.\\n\\nI don't think Jan. 6 was a singular day of failure, says Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu, who co-authored the book with University of Chicago economist James Robinson. What surprises me is why it took until Jan. 6.\\n\\nDrawing on decades of economic research, Why Nations Fail argues that political institutions — not culture, natural resources or geography — explain why some nations have gotten rich while others remain poor. A good example is North Korea and South Korea. Eighty years ago, the two were virtually indistinguishable. But after a civil war, North Korea turned to communism, while South Korea embraced markets and, eventually, democracy. The authors argue that South Korea's institutions are the clear reason that it has grown insanely more rich than North Korea.\\n\\nNations like South Korea have what Acemoglu and Robinson call inclusive institutions, such as representative legislatures, good public schools, open markets and strong patent systems. Inclusive institutions educate their populations. They invest in infrastructure. They fight poverty and disease. They encourage innovation. They are far different from the extractive institutions found in countries like North Korea, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, where small groups of elites use state power for their own ends and prosper through corruption, rent-seeking or brutally forcing people to work.\\n\\nWhen Acemoglu and Robinson wrote Why Nations Fail almost a decade ago, they used the United States as an institutional success story. They acknowledge the nation has a dark side: slavery, genocide of Native Americans, the Civil War. But it's also a creature of the Enlightenment, a place with free and fair elections and world-renowned universities; a haven for immigrants, new ideas and new business models; and a country responsive to social movements for greater equality. Lucky for America — and its economy — its inclusive institutions have had a helluva run.\\n\\nSo, almost 10 years later, how do Acemoglu and Robinson feel about American institutions? U.S. institutions are really coming apart at the seams — and we have an amazingly difficult task of rebuilding them ahead of us, Acemoglu says. This is a perilous time.\\n\\nYikes.\\n\\nAcemoglu and Robinson see the rising tide against liberal democracy in America as a reaction to our political failure to deal with festering economic problems. In their view, our institutions have become less inclusive, and our economic growth now benefits a smaller fraction of the population. Some of the best economic research over the last couple of decades confirms this. Wage growth for most has stagnated. Social mobility has plummeted. Our labor market has been splitting into two, where the college educated thrive and those without a degree watch their opportunities shrivel, after automation and trade with China destroyed millions of jobs that once gave them good wages and dignity.\\n\\nAcemoglu and Robinson believe that while factors like the transformation of our media landscape play a role, these economic changes and our political institutions' failure to grapple with them are the primary cause of our growing cultural and political divides. As opposed to some of the left, who think this is all just the influence of big money or deluded masses, I think there is a set of true grievances that are justified, Acemoglu says. Working-class people in the United States have been left out, both economically and culturally.\\n\\nTrump understood these grievances in a way the traditional parties did not, Robinson says. But I don't think he has a solution to any of them. We saw something similar with the populist experiences in Latin America, where having solutions was not necessary for populist political success. Did Hugo Chávez or Juan Perón have a solution to these problems? No, but they exploited the problems brilliantly for political ends.\\n\\nFor Acemoglu and Robinson, more democracy is the answer to our political and economic problems. In a gigantic study of 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, they found that countries that democratized saw a 20% increase in GDP per capita over the long run.\\n\\nAsked how we can stop our slide into national dysfunction, Acemoglu argues that political leaders need to focus on those who've been left behind and give them a leg up and a stake in the system. He advocates for a good jobs agenda that envisions policy changes and public investments to create, naturally, good jobs and shared prosperity (read more here). Robinson, citing the work of Harvard University political scientist Robert Putnam, argues we should find ways to transcend our political and cultural differences and connect with fellow citizens beyond our political tribes.\\n\\nWe are still at a point where we can reverse things, Acemoglu says. But I think if we paper over these issues, we will most likely see a huge deterioration in institutions. And it can happen very rapidly.\\n\\nLet's hope they don't have to revise their book.\\n\\nDid you enjoy this newsletter segment? Well, it looks even better in your inbox! You can sign up here."}

Zoe Garbarino via AP\\n\\nUpdated at 4:34 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe Trump administration is changing the number of American troops that will remain in Syria.\\n\\nApproximately 400 troops will stay there, a senior administration official has told NPR. That's double the number announced Thursday night by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nIn Thursday's one-sentence statement, Sanders said: A small peacekeeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for a period of time. But the senior administration official said Friday the troops will be observers and monitors, and not a U.N.-style peacekeeping force.\\n\\nThe official said there is no timeline for the mission and no date for withdrawal.\\n\\nAbout 200 troops will remain in the Syrian town of al-Tanf, near the border with Iraq. Their mission is to counter Iran and support U.S. forces in Iraq.\\n\\nAnother 200 will remain in northern Syria and be part of a multinational observer force numbering between 800 and 1,500, mostly European NATO allies, including France and Britain. They are located in the safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border controlled by Kurdish allies of the U.S. who have led the ground war against ISIS. The American troops will be combat-ready but their role is to monitor the region.\\n\\nAccording to The New York Times, the Sanders announcement came after a phone call between President Trump and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which the two leaders agreed to create a safe zone in Syria.\\n\\nIn December, the White House said it would pull all 2,000 troops from Syria, a reversal of U.S. policy that reportedly was met with disapproval within the Pentagon and prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign in protest. Troops began withdrawing in January, sparking criticism that the U.S. was leaving before it had completely eradicated the Islamic State presence there.\\n\\nAt a security conference in Munich last week, the U.S. encouraged its European allies to remain in Syria even as it was withdrawing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the U.S. plan. Is it a good thing to immediately remove American troops from Syria, or will it not strengthen Russia and Iran's hand? she said.\\n\\nSome have worried that Russia and Iran would fill the vacuum created by a U.S. pullout.\\n\\nA senior administration official told the Times that the decision to leave some troops in Syria was intended to encourage France and Britain to also keep troops there. European countries had unanimously told the U.S. they wouldn't stay if American forces left, The Washington Post reported, quoting a senior administration official.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, applauded the decision. This will ensure ISIS does not return and Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew, he said in a statement.\\n\\nGraham, who had been critical of Trump's December decision to pull all troops, said keeping forces there ensures that the U.S. won't repeat the mistakes it made in Iraq. This also ensures Turkey and [Syrian Democratic Forces] elements that helped us defeat ISIS will not go into conflict, he said."}

Labor Board To Again Weigh In\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tiffany Yee-Vo/Graduate Workers of Columbia-UAW Tiffany Yee-Vo/Graduate Workers of Columbia-UAW\\n\\nGraduate students at private universities are asking regulators to consider these questions: Are we employees, or not? Can we join a union?\\n\\nThe National Labor Relations Board recently decided to review its previous position, reigniting debate within the ivory tower.\\n\\nFor Paul Katz, who's three years into a history Ph.D. program at Columbia University, the 15 to 20 hours a week he spends teaching university undergraduates should mean he's an employee. He teaches in addition to conducting his own research.\\n\\nI grade all of their papers, their exams, I run review sessions, I meet with them one-on-one, basically support them throughout the semester, Katz says. The university should treat me as an employee because I do work for them.\\n\\nBut technically, he doesn't. The university classifies him as a student — even though it pays him a stipend and provides health insurance.\\n\\nIt's more or less impossible to live in New York City on a graduate stipend and not spend at least 40 percent of your income in rent, he says.\\n\\nYou must be considered an employee to form a union, so it's hard for Katz and his fellow graduate students to do much about their status. There are 1.7 million graduate students in the U.S, according to the Council of Graduate Schools. A small fraction — about 2 percent — are represented by unions, nearly all of them at public universities, which are governed by state, instead of federal, labor laws.\\n\\nWith respect to private universities, the National Labor Relations Board has flip-flopped in its policy. For decades, it held that students were not employees, then ruled in favor of students in a case in 2000. Under a new administration, the board reversed itself again four years later. Now, students at Columbia and The New School are petitioning for another change.\\n\\nJohn Logan, a labor and employment professor at San Francisco State University, says the shifts are tied largely to the political makeup of the board.\\n\\nWhen we get a new administration and the composition of the board changes, then sometimes you get this process of policy oscillation where the pendulum swings from one side to the other, Logan says.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he says, grad students' interest in unionization continues to grow.\\n\\nAaron Nisenson, counsel at the American Association of University Professors (which has an affiliated union), argues that unions in higher education are increasingly necessary, as universities — like private corporations — rely more on cheaper labor.\\n\\nEverybody starting in a professional career can get some experience at a new job, but that doesn't make it not a job, Nisenson says. Universities more broadly have been pushing a lot of the work towards contingent faculty, towards graduate assistants and towards other non-tenure track faculty.\\n\\nIn an emailed statement, Columbia University spokesman Caroline Adelman says teaching and research are part of postdoctoral training. She says students' relationships with their mentors are unlike typical employer-employee relationships and not well served by a one-size-fits-all collective bargaining process.\\n\\nPeter McDonough, general counsel of the American Council on Education, agrees. His group represents university leadership.\\n\\nGraduate students are students — students first, he says.\\n\\nMcDonough says research universities in particular give their faculty wide latitude in setting up grad student work hours and schedules. He says losing that flexibility might jeopardize some kinds of research. He also says the process has become very politicized, and current labor board members are reconsidering this issue for political, instead of policy reasons. Even if his side loses this decision, he says, it could always change back when the composition of the labor board changes again.\\n\\nI have real doubts that it would be a sustaining view, McDonough says.\\n\\nThe NLRB has not said when it might issue a decision."}
{"original": "Miami-Dade Officials Attempt To Block Debate Over Immigration Orders\\n\\nProtesters disrupted a county commission meeting in Miami-Dade County after officials tried to bar comments on a new policy on immigrants in police custody. Following an executive order from President Trump, Miami-Dade has begun detaining inmates with federal deportation orders.\\n\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\n\\nProtesters disrupted a county commission meeting in Miami today. They were angry about a new policy adopted after President Trump threatened to cut off federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities. In reaction to the president's order, Miami-Dade County has made it easier for federal authorities to catch people in the country illegally. NPR's Greg Allen reports.\\n\\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: No metropolitan area in the U.S. has a higher percentage of immigrants than Greater Miami. That's one reason why the reaction was so immediate when Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced the new county policy last month. He instructed county Corrections officials to begin holding inmates who had federal immigration detention orders. On WPLG TV's This Week In South Florida Sunday, Gimenez defended his decision.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, THIS WEEK IN SOUTH FLORIDA)\\n\\nCARLOS GIMENEZ: When President Trump put out his orders, said, you know, this - I think this gentleman is serious. And by the way, we have $350 million in federal funding that we receive every year.\\n\\nALLEN: Gimenez changed the county policy the day after Trump signed an executive order threatening to cut off federal funds to sanctuary cities. Gimenez described the decision as one of dollars and cents. But in this immigrant-rich community, many see it differently. At Miami-Dade's county commission meeting today, Chairman Esteban Bovo asked protesters to hold their comments for a special meeting later this month.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nESTEBAN BOVO: Let's not encourage it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Say no. Fight back.\\n\\nALLEN: He rejected several speakers who mentioned the word immigrant. Some, like Gaby Garcia-Vera, would not be deterred.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGABY GARCIA-VERA: I will not sit in fear of this commission to say the word immigrant because I know that our communities are under attack. And immigrants form a crucial...\\n\\nBOVO: OK, thank you. Thank you for your participation.\\n\\nALLEN: Garcia-Vera's microphone was cut off, and he was escorted out of the meeting. Miami-Dade's policy change ordered by the mayor won't become final until it's ratified by the county commission. This week, advocacy groups and legal scholars sent a letter to the commissioners saying they believed Mayor Gimenez was misreading the law and had, in their words, been duped. Trump's executive order, they say, requires only the sharing of information with federal immigration authorities, not honoring detention requests.

{"original": "U.S. State Department Issues Permit For Keystone XL Pipeline\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 11 a.m. ET Friday\\n\\nThe U.S. State Department has signed and issued a presidential permit to construct the Keystone XL pipeline. That reverses former President Barack Obama's 2015 decision to reject the controversial pipeline.\\n\\nPipeline company TransCanada says that in conjunction with the Trump administration signing off on its pipeline, it will drop a claim for more than $15 billion that it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The company also says it will drop a lawsuit that claimed Obama's decision was unconstitutional.\\n\\nWe greatly appreciate President Trump's Administration for reviewing and approving this important initiative and we look forward to working with them as we continue to invest in and strengthen North America's energy infrastructure, said Russ Girling, TransCanada president and CEO.\\n\\nFour days after Trump was sworn into office, he invited TransCanada to resubmit its application for the pipeline. The president also directed the State Department to determine within 60 days whether the pipeline is in the national interest.\\n\\nPraising the pipeline on Friday as the greatest technology known to man or woman, Trump touted the reversal as the first of many energy and infrastructure projects his administration plans to spearhead.\\n\\nThis announcement is part of a new era of American energy policy that will lower costs for American families and very significantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create thousands of jobs right here in America,  the president said in remarks from the Oval Office.\\n\\nA State Department spokesman says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recused himself from that review process. Tillerson was CEO of Exxon Mobil, which has supported construction of the pipeline. Undersecretary for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon Jr. signed the determination.\\n\\nThe proposed pipeline is controversial because of the oil it would transport. It's designed to move crude from Canada's oil sands in Alberta south to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where it could be refined or exported. Environmentalists oppose oil sands because producing it requires additional processing that emits more pollution.\\n\\nThe same communities who defeated this pipeline before — indigenous leaders, landowners, farmers and grass-roots activists — are ready to fight again, says 350.org Executive Director May Boeve.\\n\\nThat fight is expected to take place in states the pipeline would travel through, especially in Nebraska, where some landowners and environmentalists have led a years-long legal battle to stop the pipeline.\\n\\nThe oil industry and some labor unions have supported the pipeline, largely for the thousands of construction jobs it would provide. But those jobs are temporary. The State Department has estimated that once built, the pipeline will employ about 35 people."}
{"original": "Trump Axes Officials Who Gave Damaging Testimony In Impeachment Inquiry\\n\\nLt. Colonel Alexander Vindman and his brother were fired from National Security Council staff and ambassador Gordon Sondland was recalled from Europe in moves top Democrats called shameful and weak.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nRiveting accusations against the man in the White House - a finding of not guilty in the U.S. Senate, anger from the White House and then dismissals. Is all of that retribution? I'm going to ask John Dean, who cooperated with Watergate investigators and provided testimony damaging to then-President Richard Nixon. John Dean joins us on the line.\\n\\nMr. Dean, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nJOHN DEAN: My pleasure.\\n\\nSIMON: How do you assess the dismissals from the National Security Council of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother?\\n\\nDEAN: Since Mr. Trump is going nowhere in the immediate future, I think this relates to his craving need for loyalty. He is now, with some revenge, going after people he perceives as disloyal. And obviously, Vindman and Sondland would fit in that category because they testified truthfully before the House and that their testimony was relied on in the Senate trial, which he did get through.\\n\\nSIMON: But in a practical world, it would have been awkward for the Vindman brothers to continue, too, in some ways, wouldn't it?\\n\\nDEAN: Well, the Vindmans, as I understand it, had already put in for a change of venue, so to speak.\\n\\nSIMON: Yeah.\\n\\nDEAN: They were requesting to go back from the National Security Council to the Pentagon. This is not unlike what he did with McCabe, who - on his last day at the FBI, he fired him so he couldn't get his 20-year pension or whatever number it was; purely a vindictive act.\\n\\nThis, to me, is a sign of a weakness in a leader who demands loyalty. I can't imagine, for example, an Eisenhower or a Truman, say, firing people because they were disloyal. They get their following because they're strong leaders. A weak leader like Trump has to demand and command loyalty. He did it with Comey when he was, really, being interviewed to stay on the job, and Comey said, I can't do that. So Comey was removed. This has just been a constant pattern throughout the Trump presidency.\\n\\nSIMON: Mr. Dean, you testified during the impeachment process this year. It's over now. How - did the process work, do you think?\\n\\nDEAN: I think the process worked, but it showed what's happened when one party of the Senate is in the same party as the president. We're in a time, a highly partisan time, where it is difficult for the process to work. But also, even in their rationalized votes against Trump or for Trump, I should say, to stay in office, they've said this is something the voters should decide. So what they've done is they've put all this impeachment - all the charges against Trump on him to carry into the election. And I think he's going to have to bear that burden, as are a lot of senators who voted that he should get a pass at this time.\\n\\nSIMON: But surely the impeachment provision wasn't put into work only when the president and the Congress or the Senate are from opposite parties, was it?\\n\\nDEAN: Well, it was put in at a time when the Senate was not to be selected by a popular vote but rather by the state legislatures of the various states, and that was further insulation. But not unlike the Electoral College, modern times have made the machinery of the 18th century a little bit creaky.\\n\\nSIMON: Half a minute left. Mr. Dean, do you see both Republicans and Democrats trying to use this as an election issue?\\n\\nDEAN: Yes, I do. I don't think - I think the Republicans will have to defend against it. Some Republicans who are challenging incumbents are certainly going to use it against the incumbent. But no question that Trump is going to have to carry and explain this throughout the election.\\n\\nSIMON: John Dean, thank you so much for being with us, sir.\\n\\nDEAN: Pleasure, Scott.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "FACT CHECK: The White House's Private-Sector Job Streak\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nFriday brought a pretty strong March jobs report. Labor force participation (that is, the share of Americans working or looking for work) picked up, and wages were solid — two areas that haven't always been confidence inspiring in past jobs reports.\\n\\nJobseekers weren't the only ones celebrating this report; the Obama administration took the opportunity to brag, as well, tweeting about the long, uninterrupted stretch of private-sector job growth.\\n\\nThey've been touting this streak for a long time now. So what's behind the claim? We decided to dig.\\n\\nThe Claim (and Chart):\\n\\nThe Question: Is that true?\\n\\nThe Short Answer: Yes. But Obama can't take credit for a lot of that job growth.\\n\\nThe Long Answer:\\n\\nThe White House is right about the numbers. The longest streak claim was true in 2014, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker found back then, and the streak has only grown. This was the 73rd straight recorded month of private sector job growth (barring revisions).\\n\\nBut hold on. Edelman's chart implies something more: there's that point where Obama took office (that is, where the bars in the chart turn blue) and then job growth flips direction. It looks like Obama is responsible for that long stretch of job growth. Is that true?\\n\\nProbably not. Yes, the president has some influence (more on that later), but he doesn't sit at the economy's steering wheel. Even a former Obama economic advisor Austan Goolsbee says that a president has little control over much of what happens in the economy.\\n\\nI think the world vests too much power — certainly in the president, probably in Washington in general — for its influence on the economy, because most all of the economy has nothing to do with the government, he told Marketplace in 2012.\\n\\nLikewise, when a Princeton University study found in 2014 that the economy tends to do better under Democratic presidents than Republicans, the authors also added that most of the reasons behind that growth in fact don't seem closely tied to the presidents themselves.\\n\\nWe find that oil shocks, productivity shocks, international growth shocks, and (perhaps) shocks to consumer expectations about the future jointly explain about half of the partisan gap, they wrote. The first three of these look a lot more like good luck than good policy.\\n\\n(However, the authors do note that foreign policy decisions could account for some of the oil shock effects. It's also possible that Democratic presidents somehow affect consumer expectations, though as the Washington Post's Brad Plumer wrote in 2014, it's surprisingly difficult to tease out why this might be.\\n\\nOK. So a president can't claim total (or even majority) credit for the economy. Exactly how much can Obama claim in this instance?\\n\\nThat, as so many things in the dismal science, is in the eye of the beholder.\\n\\nOne thing that seems certain: the stimulus package championed by the Obama administration did make the immediate shock of the recession less painful — mainstream economists agree on that — and created millions of jobs, as the CBO found. And as we wrote in a fact check last year, it also diminished the effect on poverty levels.\\n\\nBut he wasn't the only one at work on the economy at the time, as one economist points out.\\n\\nThere were a few things going on, there was TARP, which actually happened under his predecessor, says Doug Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO and president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. There were the extraordinary monetary policies the Fed was taking, and then there was the stimulus.\\n\\nAnd in Holtz-Eakin's estimation, the Fed's role was the biggest of those three. (Additionally, at the start of the Obama presidency, the Fed was led by Ben Bernanke — not (at that time) an Obama appointee.)\\n\\nSo the stimulus helped pull the U.S. out of recession, but other factors did, too. What about the rest of Obama's tenure?\\n\\nBrookings Institution economist Gary Burtless agrees that the stimulus was massively helpful, and he also thinks that Obama's indirect influence boosted the economy.\\n\\nSome of the achievement is due to the president though his indirect influence on monetary policy, he said. And in the first two years of his term, through his direct effect on fiscal policy that the U.S. decided to pursue.\\n\\nRegarding monetary policy, Burtless is referring to Obama's reappointment of Ben Bernanke and the subsequent appointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairs. Under Bernanke and Yellen, the Fed maintained near-zero interest rates for seven years and undertook three rounds of massive asset purchases known as quantitative easing — both of which were policies to stimulate the economy.\\n\\nSo to the extent that the Fed's policies were successful, Obama to some degree had a hand in boosting the economy through Fed policy, by Burtless' logic.\\n\\nThree more caveats. This is a long string of solid job growth, Burtless notes, but not extraordinary. Job gains in the mid-1990s, as well as the late 1970s, often reached into the 300,000s, even the 400,000s — levels rarely seen in this recovery.\\n\\nThese long strings of employment reports are good, but they're not spectacularly good as I think you would judge the employment reports for much of the 1990s after about 1993 or so, says Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economics at the Brookings Institution. It's not spectacular, but they're nonetheless quite good.\\n\\nIn addition, he points out, labor force participation and the employment-population ratio are still disappointingly low (despite March's gains). Once (slash if) those bounce back, then the recovery will seem more real.\\n\\nAnother point: this is private-sector job creation. The government has had a shakier job creation record during the recovery. At this point, it has created jobs for five consecutive months.\\n\\nIn addition, while most of those economists surveyed thought the stimulus' effects would be good in the long term, early one quarter of economists said they were uncertain whether the long-term potential costs of the stimulus would outweigh the benefits.\\n\\nWhatever potential knock-on effects an economic policy might cause, Holtz-Eakin adds, a president has to claim responsibility for the good and the bad.\\n\\nThey should get some credit, some blame, said Holtz-Eakin."}

{"original": "Have New Yorkers Seen Too Much Of Anthony Weiner?\\n\\nNew York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner has apologized for 'sexting' again, and he vows to move forward. The Barbershop guys ask whether he should step back from politics, and they weigh in on other news of the week.\\n\\nCELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:\\n\\nI'm Celeste Headlee and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. It's time, yet again, for our weekly visit to the barbershop where the guys talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Sitting in the chairs for shape-up this week are writer and culture critic Jimi Izrael, he's with us from Chicago. In New York City, we have Pablo Torre, he's a senior writer with ESPN. Neil Minkoff is a health care consultant and contributor to National Review Magazine, he joins us from Boston. And on the west coast - Gustavo Arellano, he joins us - he writes the syndicated Ask a Mexican column, and he joins us from Irvine, California. So, Jimi, take it away.\\n\\nJIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Celeste. Hey, fellas. Welcome to the shop. How're we doing?\\n\\nPABLO TORRE: What's up?\\n\\nNEIL MINKOFF: What's good?\\n\\nGUSTAVO ARELLANO: What's going on?\\n\\nIZRAEL: All right, all right, well, let's get it on. Uh-oh, all right, well, former congressman and now New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner - he's kind of the gift that keeps on giving. You know, Celeste, he kind of reminds me of - he, you know what, it's like we all have a brand-new pair of roller skates, and he's got a brand-new key that he wants to show us all...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...And despite his 2000 election resignation for sexting, he couldn't - he just can't keep his finger off the send button. What's up with that, Celeste?\\n\\nHEADLEE: Yeah, the details keep coming out. But during a campaign visit to a Brooklyn soup kitchen, Weiner was asked how many women he had been in touch with online and...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...No...\\n\\nHEADLEE: ...Here's a little snippet of that Q-and-A.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN VISIT)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: How many women were there? Can you remember?\\n\\nANTHONY WEINER: There are more than - there are a few - I don't have a specific number for you...\\n\\nSPEAKER: ...Can you ballpark it?\\n\\nWEINER: ...It's not dozens and dozens - it is six to ten, I suppose. But I can't tell you absolutely what someone else is going to consider inappropriate or not.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Ay caramba!\\n\\nARELLANO: ..Less than...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nIZRAEL: Carlos DeGrossa in la casa. I love that dude, man.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Oh, boy.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Thanks, Celeste. So Weiner says he's not stepping out of the race. And he says New Yorkers care more about their future than his pants - I mean his past. Pablo...\\n\\nTORRE: ...Yes...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...This is your city. What do you think?\\n\\nTORRE: Look, I kind of agree with him in that I don't think New Yorkers really do care so much about the moralizing element of it. I think it's really funny, I think we love the fact that the Daily News and The Post are coming out with these all-time great back covers, but, honestly, it's what it says about the man, right? I mean like, I don't really care what his personal life is like, to be perfectly honest, in so far as he violates the pact he made with his wife, that's certainly a problem.\\n\\nBut really, it's what it says about a guy who can't control himself and is defying the advice of everybody around him. I worry about what this guy is like with his finger over the figurative red button. What's his decision-making process like if he can't control himself in a way that is flabbergasting. Just absolutely insane that he would keep doing this. So it's clinical or it's very deep-seated, characteristic worrying that I have about him.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Dr. Neil - Weiner's numbers have set - they were hard at one point...\\n\\nMINKOFF: ...No...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...But they've suddenly gone limp in the polls...\\n\\nMINKOFF: ...Hey...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...I mean, should he stick with it?\\n\\nHEADLEE: Oh boy.\\n\\nMINKOFF: So, I mean, here's the thing - I agree, I think that this should become - I have two quick points. One is I think that this is going to serve as a very interesting referendum on just how much we care about somebody's personal life and their indiscretions.\\n\\nBut I have to say, that, you know, Pablo said the word clinical, and I actually went on the website and I read the text and I read the narrative, and I have to say that I don't think this is a sex thing. I think this is an insecurity thing. I think this is a neurosis thing. This is about finding affirmation and finding your worth in other people responding to you. And that's why there are all those really sad texts about, you know...\\n\\nTORRE: ...Very sad.\\n\\nMINKOFF: ...Am I pathetic, do you think that I'm a bad person? And I actually think that this is such a deep seeded neurosis, insecurity kind of thing that it actually made me sad.\\n\\nIZRAEL: You know, I look at this and I kind of admire his chutzpah. I mean, post Clinton, let's be honest, it's really - post Lewinsky-Clinton there's really no compelling reason for politicians to run and hide after scandals of this type. You know, as a matter of fact, I think it even worked for candidates, because it kind of suggests that, you know, they're like the rest of us. I mean, well, some of the rest of us. I mean, not me, of course.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIZRAEL: Some of the rest of us. Gustavo?\\n\\nARELLANO: Yeah, I agree - complete show of insecurity. Do you really want a politician who's insecure? Absolutely not. You want a guy who's confident of everything that he does, come hell or high water, whether you agree with it or not. Sexting - that's so teenager. I mean, this guy, as far as I know, he hasn't admitted to any actual infidelity on his wife, just sexting, you know. In terms of actual sexual relationships, this shows me that this guy has a fetish. This guy can't even complete the deal. Do New Yorkers really want somebody like that, who can't even finish the damn thing? No. I don't think so at all...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Hey, hey, hey, hey, bro. I mean, I think Prince in Chilla, he said it best - we all have - we all got a love bizarre, bro, I mean...\\n\\nARELLANO: ...That's true...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...So before we move on, you know, Weiner was using the name Carlos Danger online - it sounds like a character from Johnny Bravo. I'm not sure if he came up with that one on his own or he used the name of his first pet or the street he grew up on. Neil, you got an online alias of any kind? Dr. Danger?\\n\\nMINKOFF: I actually do. My online alias is pseudo-nym.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTORRE: I personally go by Jimi Izrael online.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIZRAEL: Gustavo....\\n\\nMINKOFF: ...Well, that explains...\\n\\nARELLANO: ...What I love about the name Carlos Danger - it again shows how Mexicanizing the United States is turning into. We're becoming more and more Mexican. Really, Carlos, that's awesome.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Well, my - just FYI, my online pseudonym is Sweet Sweet Bag — shout-out to the Van Peebles. So, like that.\\n\\nHEADLEE: I'm going to jump in here before this goes any further, Jimi. You are listening to our weekly barbershop roundtable. We are joined by culture critic Jimi Izrael, healthcare consultant Neil Minkoff, syndicated columnist Gustavo Arellano, and sports writer Pablo Torre. Back to you, Jimi.\\n\\nIZRAEL: And I thank you. All right, well, I had hoped that we'd be done talking about the George Zimmerman case, but another juror from his trial has come forward. Celeste, we got some tape, yup?\\n\\nHEADLEE: Yeah, we do. This juror, who identified herself as Mattie, was the only woman of color on the all-female jury. She is Puerto Rican - she's a mother of eight. And here's just a portion of what she said to ABC News.\\n\\nMATTIE: George Zimmerman got away with murder. But you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with. The law couldn't prove it, but, you know, you know, the world goes in circles.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Yes, we do Mattie. And we thank you - and we thank you, Celeste. You know, she also said that she has trouble sleeping and eating because she feels she was quote - forcefully included in Trayvon Martin's death. That's too bad. Listen, I am so sick of these jurors coming forward. I do not know what motivates them beyond some microwavable single-serving brand of catharsis. Also a book deal, maybe. In my opinion, jurors should let the verdict do the talking. That's just me. Gustavo, what stood out for you among Juror 529's comments?\\n\\nARELLANO: This woman obviously never saw 12 Angry Men.\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Obviously...\\n\\nARELLANO: ...If she really did believe - if she really did believe that Zimmerman was guilty of murder or, you know, second degree murder, whatever - it's her job as a juror, once she sees the facts, to be able to stand by that. Whether that means a hung jury, OK, it's a hung jury. So it always upsets me that after the fact these jurors say, oh, yeah, you know, we really think Zimmerman did this, this, and that, but we had to follow the intent of the law or however the law was written - too much, too little, too late.\\n\\nAnd frankly, now she's accusing Zimmerman of murder - for me, it almost sounds like another liable case Zimmerman could have against this person, in addition to, who was it, NBC News or whoever chopped up his tape...\\n\\nHEADLEE: ...It was ABC. And she's Juror B29 - as opposed to 529, which is like the college savings plan...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Oh, I'm sorry...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nARELLANO: ...Yeah, but it's all too much, too little, too late. It's just really annoying...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Thank you for that, Gustavo. And Celeste. You know, interestingly enough, just days after he - Zimmerman was acquitted - he got his Superman on and he and another man helped a family get out of an overturned car. Interesting. The family said they were grateful but they backed out of press conferences to talk about it, because they didn't want any kind of publicity. Nick Minkoff, is that unfair? Should Zimmerman get to, you know, start over and, you know, cape up and save the rest of the world?\\n\\nMINKOFF: It's not so much that I think it's unfair that he gets to cape up, as much as there, you now - a couple things. One, I don't know anybody who read that news who didn't immediately roll their eyes and go, really, did that really happen? And, you know, I started thinking about Morpheus saying that I do not believe in coincidence.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHEADLEE: Oh, god.\\n\\nTORRE: ...Nerd...\\n\\nMINKOFF: I have to say, I am so tired of this celebrity culture. You know, I don't want this man to become a celebrity. I don't want him to be somebody that TMZ is following around and know what he had to eat and what he's tweeting about. The best thing you can say about this person is that a bunch of really bad things happened around him leading to somebody's death. And that shouldn't be the kind of thing that we celebritize.\\n\\nIZRAEL: So Pablo Torre, it sounds like he - that he thinks Zimmerman is going to become like a Latino or Hispanic O.J.\\n\\nTORRE: Well, to quote another line from The Matrix - that, Mr. Minkoff, is the sound of inevitability. This is...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHEADLEE: ...All right, I'm going to call into the...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nTORRE: ...But yes, I just had to say that.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Nice. All right then. Is that it? Is that all you got on it, bro?\\n\\nTORRE: I can keep going, but I think we got limited amount of time.\\n\\nIZRAEL: All right, well, check this out, man. Let's keep it moving. The speaker of the house, you know, is asking Steve King, a republican from Iowa, to stop speaking so much. Celeste, what's up with that?\\n\\nHEADLEE: Well, King has, yet again, made some controversial comments. This time about undocumented immigrants. Just this past week he said he was speaking to Newsmax, he was talking about what people call DREAMers - those are the immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Here's a bit of it.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF STEVE KING)\\n\\nREPRESENTATIVE STEVE KING: For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that - they weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes, because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Steve King there...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Holy mackerel...\\n\\nHEADLEE: ...Explaining that allowing citizenship for some undocumented immigrants might also mean allowing citizenship for a whole lot of criminals.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Wow, thanks for that Celeste. Him and Don Young should go on the road. Wow, that guy...\\n\\nHEADLEE: ...And Carlos Danger....\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Carlos Danger, en su casa. All right. Gustavo, you want a piece of this man?\\n\\nARELLANO: Oh, man. You could have a whole soliloquy on this. But this is what I'll point out. He's talked about DREAMers, he's saying DREAMers are 130 pounds, by definition, DREAMers are kids who came to this country as infants, usually younger than 10 years old.\\n\\nThey're barely going to be weighing 75 pounds - that's for starters. And if you just see his stats - for every one valedictorian, that's a hundred. So that means 99 percent of all these DREAMers are ruthless criminals or people who're exploited by the Narco cartels - that's absolutely false. Really, no one should pay attention to King, because this is a guy who has a history of making very inane remarks. I think it's just a reflection of whatever district in Iowa he's in that they keep electing this fool again and again and again. And I was going to say a word in Spanish, but I can't say it.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Don't.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nIZRAEL: We're in enough trouble as it is, right.\\n\\nARELLANO: Exactly.\\n\\nIZRAEL: Neil Minkoff, you know, Speaker Boehner - he called the comments deeply offensive and wrong. Is this, kind of, just, you know, news dispatched from the church of the obvious? Or does he have a point?\\n\\nMINKOFF: It couldn't be - I find these things to just be incredibly upsetting, because it derails an important conversation. So you have somebody out there, grandstanding, showing off, talking to - you know, trying to throw some red meat to the base and going too far and saying things that are just ridiculous and inane and completely indefensible, and it paints an entire side of the aisle as being just racist and wrong. And I find it incredibly frustrating. And I'm not frustrated with the process, I'm frustrated with the speaker - not the speaker of the House, but King, who actually said these things.\\n\\nTORRE: Just to add...\\n\\nIZRAEL: ...Go ahead, Pablo.\\n\\nTORRE: ...One of the things I find most pernicious from people who are in elected office - is this presentation of things that sound empirical but are really just the same old, really dangerous stereotypes. And honestly, that's how these things really start and get perpetuated decade over decade - is these same people making stuff up. And, you know, if he has numbers on that - feel free to present them. But don't just traffic in the same dangerous stuff that has really, honestly, stigmatized an entire group of people.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Well, since you talked about numbers, let's move on here really quickly because we want to talk about Major League Baseball. Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun has been suspended for the season. He violated Major League Baseball's drug policy. And there are a lot of reports and certainly a lot of rumors that New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez could be next. So, Pablo Torre, let me go to you, obviously. Some people are saying A-Rod should get a lifetime ban. What is going on here?\\n\\nTORRE: Yeah, I don't know if a lifetime ban is what I would personally suggest. I think a lot of this, to be honest, I mean, this has been going on for a while. These guys aren't more guilty of anything that we believe Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to have done.\\n\\nThe difference now is that the commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig, actually cares. And my suspicion, as a cynical baseball fan, is that he cares because he sees his legacy being written as the guy who didn't care about steroids. That's not to, you know, say that Ryan Braun isn't a total jerk, and Alex Rodriguez isn't a total jerk and that he didn't do all of these things, but I wonder that they're being made examples of to fulfill a larger, more selfish mission on the part of Major League Baseball. Which, from a due process perspective, would have to be troubling.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Right. But, Neil, let me bring this to you. You love baseball.\\n\\nMINKOFF: I do.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Some people say look, it's ubiquitous, just allow it. What do you think?\\n\\nMINKOFF: Yeah, so that's something I think that we struggle with. But I am a firm believer that it's better to have a standard and have a hard time living up to it, but to know that the standard is there and that's the right thing and that's the right way to do it. And if people fail to live up to that standard because of temptation and incentive, then that's a failing rather than an acceptance.\\n\\nBecause if we start to - if we say, OK, it's fine and we're going to allow steroid use in the Tour de France and Major League Baseball and football, how far down does that go? Would we condone college athletes? Would we condone high school athletes trying to get a college scholarship? Should I start writing growth hormone prescriptions for my 11-year-old? Like, at what point do we say that it can't be tolerated if we start to open the door? And that worries me.\\n\\nHEADLEE: Well, Gustavo, what do you think? I mean, it's certainly telling that a lot of these scandals in terms of doping have to do with sports that rely on individual performance, right, as opposed to team performance like hockey.\\n\\nARELLANO: This is what's happened, because Major League Baseball didn't nip it at the bud about what, at this point - 15 years ago, if not more so. There's such fatigue now among fans of Major League Baseball and other sports that it's almost to the point where you have the majority of fans saying, you know what, just let them take steroids. These are men, these are adult men who know what they're doing to their bodies. They're trying to enhance their performance so they can, you know, they can win their contracts and they can please the rest of us.\\n\\nWhy not allow them? And I think it's a dangerous example to allow steroid use with major league athletes because then you do get high schoolers and people even younger than high school starting to take them and that's going to wreck their bodies. But that is going to be Selig's legacy. Selig's legacy is, you know, long ball powered by steroids and, you know, getting almost all the big stars of that era from McGwire and Sosa, nowadays, yeah, to Braun and Rodriguez. And these are just the people that we know. Now imagine all the people that we don't know.\\n\\nHEADLEE: OK. We'll have to leave it there for the week. You just heard Gustavo Arellano. He writes a syndicated column Ask a Mexican. He joined us from Irvine, California. Pablo Torre joined us from our bureau in New York, senior writer for ESPN. Joining us from NPR member station WGBH in Boston, Neil Minkoff. He's a healthcare consultant and contributor to National Review magazine. And Jimi Izrael, of course, writer and culture critic.

{"original": "Federal Court Suspends Injunction On Trump's 'Remain In Mexico' Program\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 11:35 p.m. ET\\n\\nA federal appeals court in California on Friday briefly blocked the Trump administration's Remain in Mexico program, seemingly dealing a blow to the president's controversial policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their day in U.S. immigration court.\\n\\nBut within hours, a three-judge panel voted unanimously to suspend its own order, giving the government until the end of Monday to respond with written arguments and plaintiffs until the end of Tuesday.\\n\\nEarlier Friday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 to uphold a lower-court's injunction on the program, also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. Judges said the policy is invalid in its entirety due to its inconsistency with federal asylum law.\\n\\nIt should be enjoined entirely, the judges had said before voting late Friday to suspend the ruling.\\n\\nAbout 60,000 migrants, mostly from Central America, have been forced to wait in Mexican border towns, often in dangerous and squalid conditions, as applications are slowly processed.\\n\\nTrump administration officials considered the program a game changer in their effort to end to what they call catch and release. They said that practice allowed migrants to enter the U.S. and stay illegally by avoiding authorities.\\n\\nOfficials have also credited the program with sharply reducing the number of migrants arriving at the southern border since it went into effect.\\n\\nThe lawsuit, Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, was filed by Innovation Law Lab, the Central American Resource Center of Northern California, and four other organizations on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were sent to Mexico to wait.\\n\\nA separate ruling by the court in East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump also upheld a block on the Trump administration's attempt to restrict asylum applications to ports of entry.\\n\\nACLU attorney Judy Rabinovitz, who argued the appeal against MPP said after the initial ruling: The court forcefully rejected the Trump administration's assertion that it could strand asylum seekers in Mexico and subject them to grave danger. It's time for the administration to follow the law and stop putting asylum seekers in harm's way.\\n\\nImmigration rights advocates argue that forcing vulnerable asylum seekers to wait in temporary, often makeshift, shelters exposes them to even more violence than that which they are trying to escape. Human Rights First has documented more than 600 violent crimes and at least one murder against migrants in the program.\\n\\nThe argument swayed two of the three judges on the panel who determined that the effects of the MPP is staggering, adding that the program runs afoul of existing asylum laws, which state that an undocumented migrant may apply for asylum when she is 'physically present in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival).'\\n\\nA May ruling by the Ninth Circuit allowed the MPP to restart after an initial ruling by a federal judge had halted the program.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as asylum-seekers are processed in temporary tent courts along the border, judges are granting far fewer asylum claims than other courts. As of November 2019, just 117 migrants had been granted protection out of tens of thousands of applicants, according to data released by the TRAC immigration project at Syracuse University. That's a success rate of less than 1%."}
{"original": "TERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest is the winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction, Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel, The Sympathizer, is set during and just after the war in Vietnam and is told in the form of a forced confession written by a spy for the North Vietnamese who worked undercover as an aid to a South Vietnamese general. It appears that part of his crime is sympathizing with the suffering on both sides. That sympathy is in part a function of his own divided self. The character's mother grew up in the north of Vietnam.\\n\\nHis father was a French colonialist in Vietnam. My guest tells part of his own story in an essay at the back of the book. Viet Thanh Nguyen's parents grew up in the north of Vietnam when the country was divided in the mid-1950s. With the North under communist control, his parents fled to the South. When the South fell to the North in 1975, the family fled to America. Viet Nguyen was 4 years old at the time. He is now a professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nViet Thanh Nguyen, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why did you want to write this novel from the point of view of a spy?\\n\\nVIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, when my agent told me I should write a novel, the first thing that came to me was a spy novel and partly it was because it's a genre that I really enjoy and I wanted to write a novel that was actually entertaining, that people would actually want to read because I knew that I would also be dealing with a lot of very serious political and literary matters. And then the other inspiration for that was that there really were spies in South Vietnam that rose to the very highest ranks of the South Vietnamese bureaucracy and military.\\n\\nAnd there was a very famous spy named Pham Xuan An who was so important that during his time as a mole he was promoted to a major general by the North Vietnamese. And he was friends with people like David Halberstam and all the important American journalists. And they had no idea that he was a communist spy who had studied in the United States. So all these factors were in my mind.\\n\\nGROSS: The war in Vietnam was central to your whole family's story. Your parents are from the north of Vietnam and fled to the South in the mid-50s when the country was divided. They were teenagers then. Why did they choose to leave North Vietnam and flee to the South?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, they were part of a great migration of about 800,000 North Vietnamese Catholics who had been persuaded by their parish priests that the communists were going to massacre them or at the very least persecute them. And that idea had been promulgated by the CIA, by Col. Edward Lansdale who became famous for helping the Philippines suppress a communist insurgency in the 1950s and then he brought his talents to South Vietnam. And he became the inspiration - so it was rumored - for Alden Pyle in Graham Greene's The Quiet American. So that was the history behind why my parents had decided to flee. And they came from a region in North Vietnam that was famous for producing hard-core revolutionaries like Ho Chi Minh, who was born 30 minutes from their home village. And it was a region famous for producing hard-core Catholics, and so my parents were among the hard-core Catholics.\\n\\nGROSS: Did - your parents were teenagers when they left North Vietnam for the South. Did their families come with them?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, my mother's family did go, so all my aunts on that side of the family and my grandparents on that side of the family went. My father's parents and his siblings decided to stay in North Vietnam. And the human consequences of this were that my parents left in 1954 to go south. My parents would not return to a unified Vietnam until the early 1990s, which meant my father didn't see his own relatives for 40 years. My mom, because her family came to the South and then, you know, she left in 1975 when Saigon fell, she wouldn't see her siblings again for 20 years.\\n\\nGROSS: So your father's family who stayed behind in the North, were they persecuted like they were told by the priests that they would be?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, they weren't subjected to pogroms or anything like that, but they certainly lived a marginalized life. You know, Catholics who stayed in the North were subject to suspicion because the communist regime, which was a really hardline regime, was very paranoid about any kind of subversion and they thought the Catholics would be a kind of subversive anti-communist force, and so that meant that their economic opportunities were really circumscribed. And so when I went back to visit in around 2004, all of my uncles were still living in the same compound that my grandfather had built and they, you know, had been sustained for a couple of decades in the 1970s and '80s, early '90s by the money that my parents had sent home as remittances. So I think they definitely did feel that - even if they weren't murdered - that they were definitely discriminated against by the communist regime.\\n\\nGROSS: So in 1975, when Saigon fell, and your parent's town had already been taken over by the North Vietnamese, your family fled. So it was you, your parents and your brother?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah, I mean, the story was that in March, 1975, my father had gone to Saigon on business and my mother was at home in Buon Ma Thuot with myself, my brother and my adopted sister, who was the oldest sibling. So March, 1975, the Communist Army invades, seizes the town, cuts off all communication. My mother can't communicate with my father, so she takes our lives into her hands and decides to flee the town on foot with my brother, who was 10 years old, and myself, who was 4, and leaves behind my adopted sister, who was about 16, to take care of the family property because she believed - and reasonably so - that we would be back because that's the way the war had happened for the last 10 or 15 years - you know. So you saw battles and people would leave and they'd get to go back.\\n\\nWell, of course we never got to go back. And my mom walked downhill to Nha Trang, that port town of about 150 miles south. And the best I can say about that is that at least it was all downhill and that I don't remember any of it even though my brother does and says it was horrible. And the historical accounts that I have read indicate that it was chaos and death and lots of civilians and Southern Vietnamese soldiers dead along the way. We caught a boat from Nha Trang to Saigon, met up with my father, fortunately enough.\\n\\nAnd then a month later, the communists came and took Saigon. And according to my brother, you know, we tried various ways to get out of the city - went to the airport, couldn't get out. Finally, we made it onto - we found a barge, but we got separated. And so again my father was somewhere else. My mother was with us. And without knowing where my father was, my mother decided to get on that boat. And then later we discovered my father gotten on that boat, too. So my parents have always been risk-takers. And for us, most of the time, it's worked out.\\n\\nGROSS: Most people form their earliest memories at around, I think, the age of 4 - 3 or 4. So, like, your earliest memories have to do with the war and with trying to escape and with being separated from your father. How do you think that affected your view of the world or your just, like, your basic identity?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, I have vague images of pre-April 1975 Saigon, which are not reliable. You know, for example, I thought I remembered that when we were on that boat leaving Saigon, that sailors were shooting at smaller fishing boats that were trying to come up to us. And my brother said, no, that never happened. But then I read somewhere else that it did happen. But my most reliable memory really begins after we had come to the United States and we - all Vietnamese refugees, in order to come to the United States, were settled in these refugee camps.\\n\\nAnd ours was Fort Indiantown Gap, Pa. And in order to leave one of these camps, you had to have sponsors take you. No sponsor would take my family of four. So my brother went to one family, my parents went to one family and at 4 years old, I was sent to live with a white family. And that's when my memory begins and - of being separated from my parents. And even though that was only for a few months, it was really traumatic for me.\\n\\nAnd it's taken me a long time to understand how deeply traumatic that was, that that experience remains an invisible brand stamped between my shoulder blades. And in many ways, I've been - I spent a lifetime trying to make sense of what that trauma has meant to me.\\n\\nGROSS: Did the family who was - did the family you were staying with take good care of you?\\n\\nNGUYEN: I think I stayed with two families, if I remember right. And I think the first family was in a mobile home. They were young. They had no idea what to do with me. And now being the father of a 3-year-old, I can just imagine what kind of a terror I was at 4 years old separated from my parents in a strange household. So then I was sent to another family with children. And they did take very good care of me. I remember them, you know, with fondness. But I also remember that, you know, they tried to make me comfortable.\\n\\nAnd one of the ways that they did that was to give me a pair of chopsticks. And they all had chopsticks. And they said, show us how to use chopsticks. At 4 years old, I had no idea how to use chopsticks. And I felt very badly about that. And that was, I think, my first initiation into the sense of being culturally and racially different than other Americans.\\n\\nGROSS: What happened to your 16-year-old adopted sister who was left behind?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, you know, she had to take care of the house, take care of the family business. And when the Communists were already there, I mean, basically what they did was they seized the property, kicked her out. And then she was forced to join a volunteer youth brigade. And they were called volunteers - obviously they weren't - and sent to, you know, rebuild the country. So eventually, she came back from that. She found a husband, got married, had kids.\\n\\nWhen I went back to Vietnam in 2004, for the second time, I finally was able to meet her. And she'd been a presence in my life because I remember, you know, we had a photograph of her when she was probably 16 - black-and-white photograph. And she was beautiful. And when I was growing up, I was always haunted by that face, her face, and thinking, why is she there and not here? I have no memory of her, but her memory obviously persists in the family.\\n\\nAnd that sense of loss and of haunting had always stayed with me. And I also knew that, you know, she had been one of the people that my parents had been sending money to for decades to help keep her alive. And my own family, my parents are very, very strict, very hard-working, very upright. And then I went to Vietnam, and I met her. And she was beautiful, and she was wearing fashionable clothes.\\n\\nAnd she had makeup on, and her hair was well done. And she laughed and smiled a lot. And I was really happy to find someone in my family who knew how to have fun.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) That's funny, actually, that the sister who gets left behind at the end of the war, you know, facing who knows what kind of doom, she's the one who knows how to have a good time.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah, well, I think that's one of the reasons why my parents think she's adopted and my brother and I are not because my brother and I are not good at having fun.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) So let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. And his novel, The Sympathizer, won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel, The Sympathizer, won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's written in the form of a forced confession by a spy from North Vietnam. The novel is about the end of the war from the points of view of Vietnamese characters. Viet Thanh Nguyen fled Vietnam with his family in 1975 after the fall of Saigon. He was 4 when they came to the United States. So after - what? - about three years or so, your family moved from Pennsylvania to San Jose. And why was there a big Vietnamese community there?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, there is a big Vietnamese community in San Jose because the weather was good, because one of the refugee camps for Vietnamese resettlement was in Camp Pendleton in San Diego. So there was a significant population of Vietnamese people who were in California. And they migrated to different cities.\\n\\nAnd what happened was - through their personal connections, they started to send the signal out that California was a good place to live. The weather was nice. The economy was good. There were excellent welfare benefits. And Vietnamese people who had been scattered all over the country by deliberate government policy in order to encourage assimilation - many of them heard that message and came to California and to other places like it, such as Texas. And that's how we ended up - that was one of the reasons why we ended up in San Jose.\\n\\nThe personal connection was that when we fled Buon Ma Thuot, the person that we had fled with was a very good friend of my mother's - a single woman who was an excellent businesswoman. She made it to San Jose. She opened possibly the first Vietnamese grocery store there. And she told my mom, you know, that they definitely needed to come to San Jose to just have a better economic opportunity. And that's why we went. And we went there. We worked for this family friend in her grocery store. And within a few months or maybe a year, we - my parents opened their own Vietnamese grocery store not far away.\\n\\nGROSS: What are some of the things your parents sold in the Vietnamese grocery that you couldn't get in a supermarket?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, rice. I remember that we had just - my dad had built these racks and racks that were just stocked full of rice up into the rafters. And I remember going there after school and hiding up in these rafters amid these sacks of rice and all kind of, you know, Vietnamese fruits and things like fish sauce - nuoc mam, which is the lifeblood of Vietnamese cuisine. And there was always a certain kind of odor in the Vietnamese grocery store that I came to recognize, which was the scent of rice and fruit and spices that you cannot find anywhere else - a certain kind of mustiness, which I assume might have been alien to Americans but to Vietnamese people was the smell of comfort.\\n\\nGROSS: Your family fled South Vietnam to avoid the violence or persecution. You write the violence they sought to escape caught up with them because once they - after they opened up their Vietnamese grocery store, they were shot one Christmas Eve during a holdup of their store. What happened?\\n\\nNGUYEN: I don't know. I was very young when that happened. And I was probably less than 10 years old because I remember I was - it was Christmas Eve. I was watching Scooby-Doo! Christmas. My brother got a phone call - said to me, hey, mom and dad have been shot. And I had no reaction. I just wanted to watch my cartoon. And it's not that I didn't care. I just - I didn't know what to do with that incident. And then I remember my brother yelling at me because I didn't react.\\n\\nAnd it was really difficult, you know, to try to understand what was happening to my parents and to my brother and myself there - that there was violence. It was partly violent because my parents were shopkeepers, and this is what happens to immigrant shopkeepers. They get robbed. They get beaten. They get shot all the time.\\n\\nBut it was also the fact that, I think, a lot of South - a lot of Vietnamese refugees to the United States brought violence with them. There was a lot of domestic violence, a lot of domestic abuse. People were traumatized. They were hurt. They were scared. The men faced downward mobility and alienation. And of course, they took it out on their families - their wives and their children. And these children, a lot of them joined gangs. I was in a so-called gang when I was in the second grade. You know, I mean, it wasn't a real gang, but I got to this public high school. There were Vietnamese kids there. And immediately, we split up into gangs to fight each other.\\n\\nAnd that became a much more serious issue with, you know, teenage Vietnamese and younger Vietnamese-American boys who formed real gangs with guns and terrorized the Vietnamese community with this new phenomenon of - called home invasions. And they knew - they did this because they knew that these families kept money in gold at home and that these people were vulnerable. And my parents always told me watch out for Vietnamese people. Do not let them into the house because they may rob us.\\n\\nAnd ironically, what happened was that one day, someone knocked on our door when I was 16. And he was not Vietnamese. He was a white guy. And because he was a white guy, one of my parents - I think it was my father - let him in. And that man had a gun. And that man put that - pointed that gun in all of our faces. You know, it was only because my mother ran out into the street screaming that our lives were saved.\\n\\nGROSS: Wow. It seems just so tragic that you have this community of Vietnamese people who have so much in common. They fled their country for the same reason. They're living together in a community to - in part, to avoid the kind of hostility they may face in the larger American culture. And then they hurt each other.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, it was a revolutionary war. It was a civil war, depending on how you look at it. And what that means is that Vietnamese people were already hurting each other in Vietnam. They'd had a long tradition...\\n\\nGROSS: Good point (laughter).\\n\\nNGUYEN: ...Of doing that even before...\\n\\nGROSS: Right (laughter).\\n\\nNGUYEN: ...(Laughter) Even before the French came.\\n\\nGROSS: Right.\\n\\nNGUYEN: You know, it's a hierarchal feudal society. The Vietnamese were already exploting each other. And then that was exacerbated by colonialism and American occupation - or intervention - however you want to describe it. And so it was ironic and not ironic that when they came to the United States, they would do the exact same thing to each other because in Vietnam during the war years, you know, in order to survive in Vietnam, you had to exploit each other.\\n\\nIt was a country that was corrupted by American aid, and people brought those habits of corruption and brutal competition with them to the U.S. And they also brought the memories of Vietnamese people killing other Vietnamese people to the United States. And I'm sure that affected them and their children and created the conditions for violence and brutality towards each other in this - the very same community, as you said, that was created in order to protect each other.\\n\\nBut that is one of the basic facts of ethnic communities in the United States. They gather together for comfort, but these people who know each other and love each other so well also know where the weak spots are.\\n\\nGROSS: So I want to get back to your parents being shot when you were 10. So you were watching Scooby-Doo! Christmas, and you kind of initially paid no attention to it. You just wanted to watch your cartoon. And you don't know the circumstances of this shooting. I understand you were 10 then, but many years have elapsed since then. You've never asked your parents to tell you what happened?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah. I've asked my parents certain kinds of questions that I thought were the important ones, you know, about their life in general. And then there's certain things that I have - I don't know if I've passed over them deliberately or not. I just - why? Why reopen old wounds? I think that's been my parents' attitude towards many issues.\\n\\nAnd I think back to this one particular incident. And I'm like - you know, they were shot. And they weren't shot badly. I mean, they were released from the hospital the next day. But do I really want to go there? Do I really want to talk about this incident? I mean, it's for me to know something, but it's for them to maybe safeguard and protect.\\n\\nWhat I do know in general is that their life as shopkeepers was intensely difficult. They literally worked seven days a week every day of the year except Christmas, New Year's and Easter. And they literally worked 12 to 14 hour days. They would work at the store. And then they would come back. They would cook dinner or barely cook dinner. They were - you know, dinner was a really horrible experience. And then I would help them, you know, do the checks and tabulate the accounts. And, you know, by the time I was 10 or 11, I was helping to do the accounting.\\n\\nAnd it was a hard life. And I sympathize with this idea that maybe we shouldn't ask our parents to have to relive the difficult things that they've survived.\\n\\nGROSS: Were you afraid in the store after that?\\n\\nNGUYEN: I hated that store. You know, I am thankful to my parents that they were not the kind of - I mean, they made me do certain kinds of things, like do the accounting and all of that. But they rarely actually made me go physically to the store to help them do that kind of work. And I didn't like being there.\\n\\nAnd I think they didn't make me do these kinds of things because they wanted me to study. They sacrificed their lives in order for my brother and I to always have food, to always have clothing and to always have an education - and to have religion. Those were their priorities. But they didn't want us to become shopkeepers and to do their kind of work. So fortunately, we were protected from that.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel, The Sympathizer, won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. We'll talk more after we take a short break. And our TV critic, David Bianculli, will talk about how Jimmy Fallon, James Corden and Jerry Seinfeld's viral videos are changing comedy. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel The Sympathizer won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's set in Vietnam during the war and in LA just after. The main character is a spy for North Vietnam working undercover as an aide to a general in South Vietnam. Viet Thanh Nguyen was born in South Vietnam. He was 4 in 1975 when the war ended. The North, which was Communist, took over the South. The Americans pulled out. And he and his family fled to the U.S.\\n\\nDo you remember when you started realizing that there was an enormous conflict in the United States about the war in Vietnam and that the war had really divided America?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, I knew that we were different as Vietnamese people really early. And, you know, soon after I came - we came to San Jose, Calif., - my parents had to open this grocery. And I walked on that street, and I saw a sign in a window that said another American business driven out by Vietnamese people. So that was my first sense that, somehow, we had arrived in a place that looked at us as different. And then not long after that, the VCR arrived on the scene. And I was about 10 years old. We got a VCR.\\n\\nAnd one of the first movies that I remember watching was Apocalypse Now. I was probably about 10. And I think that was the first indication, also, that I had that there was something called this war and that this was how Americans saw this war as one that had divided them. And that was my first glimmering that there was something like a civil war happening in the American soul and that we as Vietnamese people were caught up in that because I watched that movie as a good, American boy who had already seen some American war movies - John Wayne in World War II.\\n\\nAnd I was cheering for the American soldiers until the moment in Apocalypse Now where they started killing Vietnamese people. And that was an impossible moment for me because I didn't know who I was supposed to identify with, the Americans who were doing the killing or the Vietnamese who were dying and not being able to speak?\\n\\nAnd that moment has never left me as the symbolic moment of my understanding that this was our place in an American war, that the Vietnam War was an American war from the American perspective and that, eventually, I would have to do something about that.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, you kind of work that out a little bit in your new novel because the main character, the spy, after the fall of Saigon when he comes to the U.S., he ends up being an advisor on a film called The Hamlet, that's very much modeled on Apocalypse Now. It's like your fictional version of Apocalypse Now. And in the acknowledgments for your book, you mention, like, a whole bunch of, like, books and movies that you, like, read or watched that have to do with Apocalypse Now. So your spy is, like, an advisor on this movie. What is expected of him?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, he's an advisor on this movie, which is certainly, you know, clearly alluding to Apocalypse Now. But it's really a compilation of all the movies that I'd scene about the Vietnam War because Apocalypse Now is actually a great movie, even though it traumatized me. And it's a problematic movie. But so many of the movies that were made about the Vietnam War were not that great. And The Hamlet is going to be one of these films. But his job on this film is to be the authenticity consultant.\\n\\nAnd, you know, his basic understanding of this is that Hollywood is interested in the authenticity of details when it comes to others. So they have to get the right costume down, for example. But they're not interested in the authenticity of the people that they're dealing with. So all of these Vietnamese people who've been brought in to have roles in this American epic about the Vietnam War literally have nothing to say.\\n\\nTheir function is to literally just be stage props for an American drama. And my narrator understands this. And he understands it very intellectually and viscerally that what is happening here is that Hollywood is the unofficial ministry of propaganda for the Pentagon, that its role is to basically prepare Americans to go fight wars by making them focus only on the American understanding of things and to understand others as alien and different and marginal, even to their own histories, right?\\n\\nAnd so his belief is that he can somehow try to subvert this ministry of propaganda, this vast war epic that is going to continue to kill Vietnamese people in a cinematic fashion, which is simply the prelude to actually killing Vietnamese people in real life. So he believes that he can try to make a difference. And, of course, the humor and the tragedy is that he can't.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, one of the things you say about the war and Hollywood is that, like, this is one war where the losers get to write the story.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah, and that's one of the tremendous ironies, you know, that the United States lost the war, in fact, in 1975. But for the very same reason that the United States was able to wage a war in which it lost 58,000 American soldiers, which is a human tragedy, but was able to create the conditions by which 3 million Vietnamese people died of all sides and 3 million Laotians and Cambodians died during those years and in the years afterwards.\\n\\nFor the very same reasons that the industrial power of the United States is able to produce this vast inequity of death, that's the same reason that the United States, in the years afterward, through its incredibly powerful cultural industry, is able to win the war in memory because wherever you go outside of Vietnam, you have to deal with American memories of the Vietnam War. Inside Vietnam, you have to confront Vietnamese memories. But outside, wherever I've gone and talked about the Vietnam War and memory, one of the first questions that I get is what do you think of Apocalypse Now? So...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNGUYEN: ...That's what we have to confront - right? - that American soft power is tremendously powerful. And it goes hand-in-hand with American hard power.\\n\\nGROSS: Of course, so many of the movies made about Vietnam are about the divisions in American about whether it was a just war or not and whether American soldiers committed atrocities or not.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah, and this is one of the things that people have a hard time getting their minds around. I often get questions, people saying, well, if you look at these Vietnam War movies, Americans come off really badly. And my response to that is, yes, that's true, but they're still the movie stars. And given an option between being a virtuous extra who gets to say nothing and being the demonic antihero who occupies center stage, I think everybody would choose being the demonic antihero. And that's what's happening.\\n\\nThe basic reality of the Vietnam War that Americans can't get around is that it was, in many ways, a really bad war. And so Hollywood has at least acknowledged that much. But the way that it has contained the meaning of that war is to make Americans the stars of this drama and relegate the Vietnamese to the margins, even though in reality, the Vietnamese paid the heaviest price. And that is one of the ways by which cultural power, soft power, prepares Americans to do the same things over again, that now as we confront the same parallels and analogous situations in the Middle East, the irony is that, you know, it's mostly people from these other countries that are dying.\\n\\nBut Americans are preoccupied with their own experiences. That's an exact replication of the mindset that got us into Vietnam and that has now allowed Americans to remember the Vietnam War in a certain way that makes it an America war.\\n\\nGROSS: Do you see your novel The Sympathizer in part as an answer to that, as an alternative way of seeing the war, a way of seeing it through Vietnamese eyes as opposed to through American eyes?\\n\\nNGUYEN: You know, absolutely. It's my revenge on Francis Ford Coppola.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nNGUYEN: It's my revenge on Hollywood (laughter). And, you know, my lonely, small effort - not even lovely and small. Many Vietnamese-American artists and writers are doing very similar things to try to get Americans to understand that Vietnam is a country and not a war. And they're also trying to get Vietnamese people to understand this war in a different way, too, because the Vietnamese understanding of it in Vietnam is equally problematic from a very different way. But, you know, we write novels. And what that means is my novel, even though it won this prize, is just a book.\\n\\nAnd Hollywood produces $200 million, $500 million blockbuster epics that will totally destroy my book.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, at least your book won the Pulitzer Prize (laughter).\\n\\nNGUYEN: At least, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. And his novel The Sympathizer won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us my guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel The Sympathizer won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's written in the form of a forced confession by a spy for North Vietnam. The novel is about the end of the war from the points of view of Vietnamese characters. Viet Thanh Nguyen fled Vietnam with his family in 1975 after the fall of Saigon, when he was 4 years old. They came to the United States.\\n\\nYour novel is written in the form of a confession - the confession of a North Vietnamese spy whose name we don't know. And I'm wondering if you read any confessions before writing this book, or if you read what you describe as the discourse of steady groups, committees and parties - parties as in Communist Party, not like New Year's party.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Right exactly. Well, you know, I certainly knew that the confession or the autobiographical self-criticism was a really important part of Chinese and Vietnamese Communist efforts to reeducate - that's a euphemism - reeducate the people that they had defeated. And I hadn't actually read any of those but I'd heard about them repeatedly. And I had read autobiographical accounts of people who had survived these kinds of reeducation camps or reeducation experiences. So I had a pretty good idea of what these kinds of autobiographies would look like. And to me it seemed like this was a great literary form, to try to adapt and to integrate with the spy story that is a part of the novel because the confession certainly has other roots - Christians have been writing confessions since Saint Augustine, at the very least - and it meshed very well with the idea of a political confession, too. And my narrator struggles with both what it means to be a communist and what it means to be a Catholic.\\n\\nAnd the other reason why the confession became really important to the novel is that it's confession written from one Vietnamese person to another Vietnamese person who was the interrogator. And what that meant was that what I could do in the novel was to construct an implied audience of Vietnamese people. So it was Vietnamese people talking to Vietnamese people, which is not how minority literature typically works in this country. Typically if you're a minority writer in this country you're expected to write towards the white audience. I mean, the literary industry is 89 percent white. They're the first line of defense in terms of getting published in this country and minority writers understand that. And I really did not want to write this novel with a first audience of white Americans. I wanted to write it with a first audience of other Vietnamese people. And I knew that this would fundamentally change the way that the novel was written and how it would situate the American readership.\\n\\nGROSS: You write that your parents are prosperous, your brother is a doctor who leads a White House advisory committee on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, you're a professor, you're a novelist, you're a Pulitzer Prize winner, but you say our family story is story of loss and death, for we are here only because the U.S. fought a war that killed 3 million of our countrymen, not counting over 2 million others who died in neighboring Laos and Cambodia. Do often think about what your life would've been like if your family had stayed in Vietnam?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Well, of course because I have my sister's story as an example. And I have the stories of many, many Vietnamese people who stayed behind or were left behind who are relatives of people who came to the United States or to other countries. And of course for many of them it was a really, really difficult time and a really horrible experience. And I know that when I talk about these kinds of things in this context that what people are hearing in your audience is that my family and myself are examples of the American dream - we've made it, right? And I really resist that idea.\\n\\nI mean, obviously we're successful and we're successful partially because of the opportunities that America has offered. But, again, it's only possible because of a war that the United States waged in Vietnam. And there are so many Asian immigrants and refugees who have come from countries like the Philippines, Korea, Laos, Cambodia who are here in the United States because of wars that the U.S. waged overseas. And the difficulty for Americans and for these refugees and immigrants is to think about both of these kinds of things at the same time - economic opportunity domestically in the United States for some Asian immigrants and refugees, not all of them - that are made possible because of foreign wars that the United States have waged abroad.\\n\\nAnd the way that I think about it is that I have to insist all the time that I am not an immigrant and that I - the story that I'm telling in my novel is not an immigrant story. I'm a refugee and the story I'm telling is a war story because one of the ways that the United States tries to contain the meaning of these histories is to think that all of these Asians are here because they're immigrants, and that their story begins once they get to the United States. But again, my understanding is that many of these Asians are here because of the consequences of wars. And many immigrant stories and refugee stories need to be understood as war stories.\\n\\nGROSS: So your first name is Viet, which is I think a very common name for people from Vietnam. It's also the first half of the name of the country that you were born in - Vietnam. What does Viet mean?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Viet just means the name of the people. So my parents chose for me a very nationalist and patriotic name. And in combination with my last name - Nguyen - I am basically John Smith in Vietnam. But what's also interesting is that, you know, I've always understood that even as common as that name is - my name is for Vietnamese people here in the United States, it's obviously for many Americans - for most Americans - a very foreign name that they have a hard time getting their tongue around. But I've never changed my name because I think for whatever reason, as ambivalent as I feel about coming from Vietnam - especially, you know, when I was an adolescent growing up in the United States - as ambivalent as I felt about it, I also felt that I was Vietnamese. And whether or not Vietnamese people accept me as Vietnamese or see me as authentically Vietnamese, I always felt that there was a part of me that had been marked by being born in Vietnam, that had marked indelibly by being a refugee, by war and that I would not give up my name for anybody. My parents, for example, I think are more pragmatic. They have adopted American names legally, even though they're very, very, very Vietnamese.\\n\\nGROSS: Really? Your parents changed their names?\\n\\nNGUYEN: Yeah, they have. They changed their names. I mean, in the Vietnamese community they go by their Vietnamese names. But they're very pragmatic. As business people outside of that community, to do business they go by their American names on their driver's licenses. And I had that option when I - when we became citizens, to change my name. And I thought, maybe I can be Troy.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nNGUYEN: Though whatever name I tried - see, you laugh. Nothing sounded right. Nothing sounded right except my own name. So I've always stayed with it despite the minor cost that it might have entailed in terms of not seeming to be quite as American as everybody else. But obviously the ambition is to make Americans say my name, to make Americans recognize that this is also now an American name. It is also now a French name. It is also now an Australian name. My surname, Nguyen, is the fourth most popular surname in Australia. You know, we've transformed the countries that we've come to and the people who live in these countries will eventually be able to say our names in the same ways that they say Coppola.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, Viet, thank you so much for talking with us. And congratulations on winning the Pulitzer.\\n\\nNGUYEN: Thank you so much for having me, Terry. It's been a pleasure.\\n\\nGROSS: Viet Thanh Nguyen won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction for his novel The Sympathizer.

{"original": "Warren Kicks Off 2020 Presidential Campaign In Iowa\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., took her economic message to Iowa during her first campaign trip since announcing her exploratory committee for a presidential bid in December.\\n\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\\n\\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is kicking off her presidential run this weekend with a swing through the early voting state of Iowa. Warren is the first major candidate to visit the state this political season. But she's just one of some two dozen Democrats expected to run for president in 2020. NPR's Asma Khalid is in Iowa and has been talking to Democratic voters about what they're looking for in a candidate in these early stages of the 2020 primary campaign.\\n\\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Elizabeth Warren has one central message for voters. The middle class is getting hollowed out. And this weekend, she took that message across Iowa with pit stops in a couple of pretty Republican counties.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nELIZABETH WARREN: It's a dangerous time for our country. And I very much appreciate the effort that folks here in Iowa put into helping us determine the direction our country will take from here.\\n\\nKHALID: When you ask Democrats in Iowa what's important to them, a lot of them mention the same few issues - health care, college affordability, the climate and the economy. In the huge field of potential presidential Democratic candidates, there's a degree of nuance on these issues. But voters do not necessarily see major policy differences - at least not yet. And so what it comes down to for a lot of folks, like Richard Malloy from Sioux City, is just somebody who can beat Donald Trump.\\n\\nRICHARD MALLOY: Oh, right now it's very strong we get another Democrat back in, and we get Trump out. It's my main objective right there.\\n\\nKHALID: You cannot overstate how frequently Democrats bring this up. They want someone electable. But that word, electability, means different things to different people. Some voters want a candidate who'll bring a more aspirational message. Others, like Geri Frederiksen, want a politician who will punch back against Donald Trump.\\n\\nGERI FREDERIKSEN: Whoever it is has to be able to stand up to him. I don't think you have to stoop to his level. But you have to be firm.\\n\\nKHALID: This is Iowa. And so Democrats here, like Jean McGinnis, feel their party needs a candidate who can talk to voters in red states. McGinnis was in line to get her picture taken with Warren.\\n\\nJEAN MCGINNIS: I'm looking for somebody with broad appeal so that we can pull in some of the independents and the Republicans.\\n\\nKHALID: And for McGinnis, Warren could be that person. But another voter in the crowd, Leif Erickson, is not so sure she is.\\n\\nLEIF ERICKSON: She stood up to Trump. And I don't know. Maybe it backfired on her a little bit.\\n\\nKHALID: The thing is, even though Iowans make their choice first, they're not necessarily representative of what Democrats across the country want. Some Democrats in other states say the party ought to forget about winning Trump voters back and, instead, focus on boosting turnout among minorities. But here in Iowa, the consensus is the party needs someone who can go into rural neighborhoods and try to win them over. Warren's economic message resonates with voters at her rallies. And some say they're impressed with how she's taken on the banking industry. But they also say they've got a year to make up their minds. They want to see more candidates.\\n\\nMARILYNN LEGGIO: I want somebody to get Trump out of there big time.\\n\\nKHALID: That's Marilynn Leggio. She brought her teenage granddaughter with her to a Warren rally. She says she has no doubt the Massachusetts senator would do a good job. But she's not sure, after what happened with Hillary Clinton, whether a woman can win.\\n\\nLEGGIO: I think there's a lot of men out there that would never vote for a woman. I hate to say that. But I think that, especially a woman that's strong, you know, very opinionated - I think a lot of men think she's pushy.\\n\\nKHALID: But even if voters, including Leggio, cannot agree on exactly what this idea of electability means, they point to a common trait - authenticity, someone who just feels real, whether or not that alienates people.

{"original": "Outgoing NPR Health Policy Correspondent Reflects On Her Favorite Story\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nYou meet a lot of people in a 40-year reporting career. That is how long Patti Neighmond has worked for NPR, much of it with our science desk. As she retires this month, she looks back on one person who stuck with her - a young woman named Jenny Langley, who was paralyzed from the neck down. Her fight with the state of Georgia in the early '90s made a difference for countless people with disabilities like hers. Here's Patti's reflection.\\n\\nPATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: I've always felt that as a journalist, it's a privilege to be allowed into people's lives and hear their stories, especially stories like Jenny Langley's. I met Jenny when she was 28 and living with her sister's family in Atlanta, Ga. Jenny takes long breaths from the ventilator so she has enough oxygen to speak.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nJENNY LANGLEY: And if I didn't have my family and friends, I wouldn't have the will to go on and have fun and do what - they make life fun for me.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: The day I met her, Jenny was seated in her wheelchair at the dining room table with her sister. Jenny was all smiles, joking that she sounds like Darth Vader when she breathes. But then she tells me about the diving accident that paralyzed her from the waist down at 14 and, 10 years later, the car accident that paralyzed her from her neck down and left her dependent on a ventilator. For years, her parents cared for her at home, but the costs were overwhelming. Eventually, they went bankrupt and lost their home. Her sister, Sheryl Langley, wanted Jenny to move in with her and her family.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nSHERYL LANGLEY: I can do the physical. I can do the love. I can do every bit of it. I can't come up with the money. Jenny is a very expensive young lady, through no fault of her own.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: Jenny had no choice but to go on Medicaid, which only paid for long-term care in a nursing home, and that scared her. She knew her roommates could be decades older and maybe demented.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nJ LANGLEY: I would have laid in the bed all day with them. No contact with the outside world, nobody to talk to. And if I did get up, they wouldn't have let me go outside. And one of the most favorite things in the world to me - just to go outside and sit in the sun.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: Jenny and her family decided to fight the state's Medicaid policy. They partnered with the Shepherd Center, which specializes in spinal cord injury and cared for Jenny after her accidents. Together, they built a case to prove to the state of Georgia that it was cost-effective and more compassionate to allow Medicaid to pay for long-term home care. At the time, Mark Johnson was director of patient advocacy for the center. He took Jenny to the state Capitol, where she boldly approached and talked to lawmakers.\\n\\nMARK JOHNSON: Her willingness to tell her story encouraged other people to tell their stories. And ultimately, that led to some policy change in Georgia.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: It took two years, but Jenny was victorious. In 1992, the state of Georgia changed its laws. It gave Medicaid recipients a waiver, a choice to pay for long-term care in an institution or at home. Only about five other states offered such a choice, but since then, Johnson says, a lot has changed.\\n\\nJOHNSON: If you think about Jenny's story, it was almost 30 years ago. Through the efforts of more people advocating, every state has some form of waiver.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: Jenny was able to move in with her sister. The family cared for Jenny until she died in 2002 at just 40 years old. Sarah Morrison was Jenny's physical therapist. Today, she's president of the Shepherd Center and says that now quadriplegics can have a normal life expectancy, thanks to advances in technology. For me, the most poignant advance is one that could have helped Jenny - a diaphragm pacing system.\\n\\nSARAH MORRISON: This is an electric stimulation that is implanted into your diaphragm muscle that helps you inhale, which is a much more natural way of breathing because you're breathing through your mouth, not having air forced through a tube into your lungs, which is what a ventilator essentially does.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: And Morrison says some people can go for years without using a ventilator, something that would have transformed Jenny's life. Even so, I remember Jenny as a self-possessed, grateful woman who relished life despite her disability and cherished the time she had with her boyfriend.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nJ LANGLEY: He plays a piano in a band. Yeah, we like to go to Bennigan's and hang out, eat fried mushrooms, drink margaritas (laughter). He's a real nice guy. I've known him for years. He knows me, the real person. He doesn't see a wheelchair and a ventilator.\\n\\nNEIGHMOND: Jenny is no longer with us, but her legacy is strong. And today, because of her effort and accomplishment, people with disabilities like hers now have greater power and choice over how they live their lives.\\n\\nPatti Neighmond, NPR News.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "House Passes Historic Health Care Bill\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP Charles Dharapak/AP\\n\\nCapping a year of legislative activity and ending decades of Democratic frustration, the House on Sunday passed a bill that would extend health care coverage to more than 30 million Americans.\\n\\nQuoting a letter from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to President Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, Passing health care is the great unfinished business of our country. She added, That is, until today.\\n\\nAs the GOP promised, not a single Republican voted for either health care measure before the chamber. This is truly a remarkable moment in the life of this nation. Some say we're making history. I say we're breaking history, breaking with our best traditions, said Mike Pence (R-IN), who chairs the House GOP Conference. Only in Washington, D.C., can you spend a trillion dollars and say that you're saving the taxpayers money.\\n\\n'A Victory For The American People' Obama's Remarks On The Bill's Passage\\n\\nWith a vote count of 219 to 212, the House gave its approval to a measure initially passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve. Thirty-four Democrats joined 178 Republicans in voting no. That bill now goes to President Obama for signing.\\n\\nThe House also passed a so-called reconciliation measure on a 220 to 211 vote that makes significant changes to the main health care bill. Thirty-three Democrats voted against the bill, along with 178 Republicans. That measure heads to the Senate, which is expected to begin debate within days.\\n\\nObama watched the votes in the White House's Roosevelt Room with Vice President Joe Biden and about 40 staff aides. When the long sought 216th vote came in on the reconciliation bill — the magic number needed for passage — the room burst into applause and hugs. An exultant president exchanged a high-five with his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.\\n\\nWe proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things, the president said a short while later in televised remarks. We proved that this government — a government of the people and by the people — still works for the people.\\n\\nA Democratic Victory Lap\\n\\nSenate action on the reconciliation bill will be marked by extensive parliamentary maneuvering. But Democrats are optimistic about their chances in that chamber.\\n\\nAnd, for now, they are giddy about passing landmark legislation to provide insurance to 32 million Americans.\\n\\nWe have come to a defining moment in our nation's history, said James Clyburn (D-SC), the House Democratic whip. This is the civil rights act of the 21st century.\\n\\nAt their victory news conference following the vote, Democratic leaders gave a place of honor to John Dingell (D-MI), the House's longest-serving member. Dingell followed his father into a Detroit-area House seat in 1955 and like his father has introduced universal health legislation throughout his career.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nWe finally did it, Dingell said. This is an extraordinary bill. If you're looking at me, you're seeing a great big Polish smile.\\n\\nDingell was credited with keeping at his protege Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) at the negotiating table over the weekend to work out an agreement on abortion restrictions that secured the Democrats' legislative victory.\\n\\nMr. Dingell had a piece of me yesterday for quite some time, Stupak told reporters Sunday.\\n\\nA Fundamental Transformation\\n\\nDemocratic presidents — as well as occasional Republicans including Richard M. Nixon — have long sought to enact universal health care legislation. President Bill Clinton's failed effort in 1993-94 had taken the issue off the table for over a decade.\\n\\nPresident Obama has received considerable criticism for having over-learned the lessons of Clinton's experience. In contrast to Clinton's strategy of crafting a highly-detailed proposal, Obama let Congress work its will.\\n\\nWe have come to a defining moment in our nation's history. This is the civil rights act of the 21st century.\\n\\nThat looked like it might have been a mistake as legislation bogged down at various points — especially when it appeared to have been nearly derailed by the special election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts in January, costing Democrats their 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.\\n\\nBut Democrats have now successfully jumped through most of the procedural hoops. Passage of the bill represents the biggest change in domestic policy since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, says Sara Rosenbaum, who chairs the department of health policy at George Washington University.\\n\\nWe have now fundamentally transformed American society, she says. We have gone from assuming many people will not have insurance to expecting that people will have insurance.\\n\\nHighlights Of The Bill\\n\\nThe $940 billion bill seeks to extend health coverage to most Americans. Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, will be expanded to cover all adults earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\\n\\nPrivate health insurance will be made available to individuals and small companies through exchanges that will be run by the states. Individuals who do not buy insurance face fines, as do most employers who do not offer coverage to workers.\\n\\nBill sponsors predict that all but about 5 percent of non-elderly Americans will ultimately be covered. Half of those currently uninsured will receive coverage through the expansion of Medicaid and half through private insurance through the exchanges — often with subsidies that make up the bulk of the legislation's projected costs.\\n\\nThere will be a broad public education effort, so that people understand what's in the legislation, says Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group that lobbied for the bill. As a result, I think there's going to be growing and substantial support for the reform.\\n\\ntoggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nSavings In The Future\\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation will reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years and by some $1.2 trillion over the following decade.\\n\\nIt's the biggest deficit reduction we will be able to vote on in this Congress, and other Congresses as well, said Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the House majority leader.\\n\\nCritics of the bill say such savings are a fiction, as they are dependent on future Congresses sticking to plans to impose major cuts in Medicare and unpopular new taxes on health plans. We are creating a massive new entitlement, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) said during floor debate Sunday.\\n\\nPledging To Repeal\\n\\nRepublicans who are unanimous in their opposition to the legislation will continue their efforts to stymie it in the Senate. They have also vowed to make the issue the centerpiece of their campaign to regain control of Congress come November.\\n\\nThis debate is not about the uninsured, it is about socialized medicine, said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA). Alluding to the ghosts of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union, he said, With passage of this bill, they will haunt Americans for generations.\\n\\nTwo hundred Republican candidates and members of Congress have signed a pledge, promulgated by the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, to repeal the legislation upon the party's return to power.\\n\\nIf this bill passes, we will have an effort to repeal the bill, House GOP Leader John Boehner (R-OH), said on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. I'd have a bill on the floor the first thing out.\\n\\nBut even if Republicans do regain control of one or both chambers, they still would have to contend with Obama's potential veto of any major changes to the law, at least for two more years. And getting such changes to the president's desk might be just as problematic as passing the health bills in the first place.\\n\\nWhat are they going to be able to repeal without 60 votes? says Robert L. Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. The 60-vote rule suddenly works to their disadvantage.\\n\\nConstitutional Challenges\\n\\nThe legislation will face legal challenges as well. On Wednesday, Butch Otter (R-ID) became the first governor to sign a law requiring the state attorney general to sue the federal government if it forces individuals to buy health insurance – a central tenet of the legislation. Other states are likely to pass similar measures, including Arizona, where the question will be put directly to voters.\\n\\nChallenges on states' rights grounds are not likely to succeed. But because of the novelty of the requirement that individuals buy insurance, other constitutional challenges are certain.\\n\\nTwo attorneys for the Congressional Research Service determined last summer that Congress is on shaky ground relying on its authority to regulate interstate commerce to create the so-called individual mandate.\\n\\nWhether such a requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal, they wrote, as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service.\\n\\n-- With reporting from the Associated Press"}
{"original": "Border Patrol Crackdown Shines Light On Rising Number Of Migrant Deaths\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/Associated Press Guillermo Arias/Associated Press\\n\\nThe recent arrest of an activist from the group No More Deaths is highlighting the rising number of people who die crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and the challenges that humanitarian workers confront when they try to help.\\n\\nAt least 7,209 people have died while illegally crossing the southwestern border over the past 20 years, according to U.S. Border Patrol data, but an investigation by USA Today finds official statistics underestimate the number of deaths. The number is much higher because, for the most part, federal authorities' casualty count does not include people whose remains are recovered by local authorities.\\n\\nWhile data reveal that fewer people are crossing illegally overall, more migrants are taking remote and dangerous routes in Arizona due to increased border security at safer crossing points in California and Texas, says Alicia Dinsmore, a volunteer with No More Deaths.\\n\\nPeople weren't crossing through treacherous terrain like the terrain they currently are until the 2000s, she tells Here & Now's Robin Young. In the mid-'90s, Border Patrol changed its enforcement policy to build up enforcement in the easy-to-cross areas and funnel people into the harsh, desolate desert terrain.\\n\\nSince 2001, the remains of at least 2,832 migrants have been recovered in southern Arizona, according to the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants. Before the start of the decade, fewer than five dead border crossers were found in Arizona each year; that number jumped to 79 in 2001.\\n\\nHumanitarian groups have stepped in to help the migrants by providing food, water and medical services. But a report published last week by No More Deaths and La Coalición de Derechos Humanos found that Border Patrol agents routinely sabotage those efforts.\\n\\nWater containers were vandalized almost twice a week on average in an area of the desert southwest of Tucson from March 2012 to December 2015, the report found. Videos posted online also show agents kicking over water jugs in the desert.\\n\\nOn the same day the report was released, agents arrested No More Deaths volunteer Scott Warren, a faculty associate at Arizona State University, on charges of harboring immigrants trying to enter the country illegally in a building in Ajo, Ariz.\\n\\nNo More Deaths stopped short of calling Warren's arrest retaliation for the report but said the timing was suspicious. Seven other volunteers were also charged with federal crimes this week.\\n\\nWe don't smuggle them, we don't do anything to help them enter the United States, we do nothing illegal, said Bill Walker, Warren's attorney. This place that they raided is not in the middle of the desert, it's not hidden anywhere. It's in the city of Ajo, and it's been used for a long time, not to help smuggle migrants, but to give medical care and food and water.\\n\\nA Border Patrol spokesperson declined to comment on the Warren case and deferred to the U.S. attorney's office. Denying that the agency targeted Warren or the aid group, spokesman Carlos Diaz said, It wasn't retaliation.\\n\\nIn previous cases, federal officials have accused volunteers of littering in wildlife areas, but aid workers say water jugs left in the desert save lives.\\n\\nBorder Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security say they are preventing deaths by discouraging migrants from trying to cross in the first place, but critics say that is not happening.\\n\\nThe agency said we are going to ... put enforcement in the easy-to-cross areas and use the risk of death in the desert as a deterrence to crossing, Dinsmore says. So the idea that Border Patrol is the actor that should be saving people's lives is absurd because they are creating this crisis in the first place."}
{"original": "Ben Carson Endorses Donald Trump\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images\\n\\nOne week after he formally dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is endorsing New York businessman Donald Trump.\\n\\nCarson said a major factor for the endorsement was the growing talk among many Republicans of working to deny Trump the majority of delegates he'd need to clinch the party's nomination, and instead hold a contested convention this summer.\\n\\nOne of the real factors for me is what will happen if we allow the political operatives to succeed in their endeavor to stop Donald Trump, said Carson at a Friday morning press conference in Florida. I think it would fracture the party irreparably, and it would hand the election to the Democrats.\\n\\nNow some people said, 'now why would you get behind a man like Donald Trump?' Carson said. I'll tell you why. First of all, I've come to know Donald Trump over the last few years. He is actually a very intellegent man who cares deeply about America.\\n\\nThere's two different Donald Trumps, Carson continued. There's the one you see on the stage, and the one who's very cerebral, sits there, and considers things very carefully. You can have a very good conversation with him. And that's the Donald Trump that you're going to start seeing more and more of right now.\\n\\nCarson's support comes just a week after he officially ended his campaign. The famed African-American physician had a surge of support last fall, but faltered after his comments regarding terrorist attacks exposed his weaknesses on foreign policy.\\n\\nThe conservative favorite could help boost Trump heading into a critical primary day on Tuesday, where big winner-take-all prizes are up for grabs in Florida and Ohio.\\n\\nThe relationship between the two hasn't always been warm and fuzzy. Late last year as Carson was on the rise, Trump came out swinging at him, questioning the redemption story at the heart of Carson's narrative — how he overcame a violent childhood and a pathological temper to become a world-renowned surgeon.\\n\\nIf you're a child molester, there's no cure. They can't stop you. Pathological? There's no cure, Trump said.\\n\\nBoth men attempted to move past that history during the Friday morning press conference.\\n\\nThe one person that just kept sneaking up on me - I couldn't lose him - was Dr. Ben Carson. ...And so I started going after Ben said Trump, bluntly acknowledging the political calculations that go into political attacks. It's politics. Ben understands that. And I was really impressed by the way he fought back. Because he fought back with silence and strength.\\n\\nWe buried the hatchet, said Carson. That was political stuff. And that happens in American politics."}

Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nDemocrats officially took control of the House of Representatives one month ago with a promise of moving quickly on a fresh agenda centered on protecting health care and making Washington work better.\\n\\nUntil last week, those plans were on pause. Committees couldn't form, legislation stalled and their whole message was about ending the shutdown. Now, as Washington returns to legislating with a three-week period to focus on a spending deal, Democrats are working to catch up before Trump takes center stage with a prime-time State of the Union address delivered from their home turf — the House floor.\\n\\nThere's no question that the government shutdown consumed everyone's attention, said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. The president I think did that purposefully.\\n\\nCicilline, who leads a team of Democrats tasked with setting policy and messaging priorities, said he believes Trump deliberately timed the shutdown to take the wind out of Democrats' sails.\\n\\nBut Cicilline and other top Democrats say that's changing now. Committee members have been announced, staff is coming on board and Democrats have begun to introduce a backlog of bills, like a revival of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\nThat legislation, paired with HR 1, a bill to reform campaign and ethics rules, were the backbone of Democrats' messaging in the single week of open government before the State of the Union.\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., says members will have even more chances to make their mark in the weeks to come.\\n\\nThere's this frustration about focusing on the negative aspect of shutting down the government of the United States of America, Hoyer said in an interview with NPR. But I think they're going to feel a lot better four months from now because I think we're going to have dealt with a lot of very substantive issues that we talked about in the campaign.\\n\\nHoyer says committees are getting ready to take up plans to lower the cost of prescription drugs and move bills designed to retrain workers and get more people higher paying jobs.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd some Democratic lawmakers say they have the opportunity to launch their agenda with new attention now that the shutdown is over. Democrats in Congress have higher than usual approval ratings after the shutdown, and polls showed a majority of voters sided with Democrats in that fight.\\n\\nMembers like Progressive Caucus Co-chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., say that gives Democrats a powerful platform.\\n\\nWe didn't back down on this president and we showed that we will hold him accountable, Jayapal said. That got us enormous credibility with the American public.\\n\\nBut that may not be helpful for many of the more moderate Democrats who won tough races in previously Republican districts on promises to overcome gridlock.\\n\\nThat's why losing the early weeks of legislating has been particularly frustrating for a lot of freshmen. They wanted a head start before the State of the Union, where Trump will set his own agenda.\\n\\nAnd their class co-chair, Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, says his fellow newbies are itching to show their constituents that they can deliver on their campaign promises.\\n\\nWe are the class that delivered the majority and we are the class that I think in many ways is closest to the people, Allred said. We want to make sure folks that have been here are aware of what our priorities are.\\n\\nSpecifically, Allred says Democrats want to protect pre-existing conditions, the defining issue that helped them win this new majority. Focusing narrowly on policies with broad support also helps Democrats avoid internal bickering over more complicated issues — like the finer details of how far left the party can go in embracing a Medicare-for-all proposal.\\n\\nThose are things that no matter where you are on the spectrum you have a common denominator of agreement, Allred said. Those complicated areas — like how far left to go on Medicare-for-all will wait.\\n\\nPlus, as Hoyer and Jayapal are quick to remind members, there's still lots of time before the 2020 election begins.\\n\\nA lot of members just spent the last year, two years in some cases, campaigning, so a few weeks feels like a lifetime, Jayapal said. We're in January, we're not in June. If this is still the case in June that would be a problem."}
{"original": "Not All Fun And Games: New Guidelines Urge Schools To Rethink Recess\\n\\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\\n\\nWhat's the best time for students to have recess? Before lunch, or after? What happens if it rains? If students are misbehaving, is it a good idea to punish them by making them sit out recess?\\n\\nThose are just a few of the issues addressed in new guidelines designed to help schools have good recess. The recommendations come from a group called SHAPE (Society of Health and Physical Educators) America and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nRecess might seem simple — just open the doors and let the kids run free. But only eight states have policies that require it, according to last year's Shape of the Nation report. And when researchers started looking, they found very little consistency or guidance about what makes recess effective.\\n\\nThe new guidelines, in two documents, offer educators a list of 19 evidence-based strategies and a template to show them what a good recess policy looks like.\\n\\nSome of the suggestions seem obvious, like promote a physically active environment or designate spaces for outdoor and indoor recess. But there's a point there. Without a designated indoor space, for example, schools might just cancel recess when it's raining or snowing.\\n\\nOh, and the answers to those other questions above? Before lunch is better, the guidelines say, because recess can make kids hungry, and thus more likely to eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. And maybe they won't throw food away uneaten. And they say recess should never be used as punishment, because it deprives students of physical activity — which can be a much-needed outlet.\\n\\nThere's a lot that has to be squeezed in[to] that time a student is in class, says Michelle Carter, senior program manager at SHAPE who helped develop the guidelines. I don't think there's a value placed in recess and physical activity.\\n\\nThe guidelines seek to impress on schools that recess isn't just downtime for educators or playtime for students. Research has shown that play helps students pay attention in class, prevents bullying and develops social and emotional learning.\\n\\nAn evolving process\\n\\nOne school that has tried to put these guidelines into practice is Thomasville Primary School in Thomasville, N.C. The researchers at SHAPE and the CDC used the pre-K through third grade school as a case study in developing the new policies.\\n\\nAlyson Shoaf, the school's active living wellness coordinator, says the guidelines helped make recess part of the curriculum. There was really just nothing out there to help the school-level people support and implement this stuff, she says.\\n\\nBefore the new policy, Shoaf says, recess was often withheld from students as punishment. Teachers might be looking at their phones and not paying attention. And sometimes, students got into arguments.\\n\\nThe new approach brought several key changes: creating special zones on the playground where teachers monitor students, scheduling teachers for recess duty and giving students access to the entire playground. The goals? More structure, more freedom and more fun.\\n\\nInitially, Thomasville's principal wasn't too wild about the idea.\\n\\nAbsolutely not, said principal Angela Moore. When Shoaf first brought the idea to her, Moore says the program seemed too structured, and she thought it would force the students to play games that didn't interest them.\\n\\nBut Moore says she changed her mind when she saw how much more active students were at recess. And how much more the teachers were involved. The numbers prove it was working: Schoolwide discipline referrals, she says, have declined — from more than 100 last school year, to 24 so far this year. If that pattern continues for the rest of the school year, Moore notes, it would be a roughly 50 percent drop.\\n\\nAlyson Shoaf says some teachers needed extra convincing, too.\\n\\nThis was a process. It did not just happen overnight, Moore says. And it's still a process.\\n\\nNo equipment? No problem\\n\\nA concern at some schools — especially in low-income neighborhoods — might be whether a structured recess program would require a lot of expensive equipment. Not so, says Michelle Carter of SHAPE.\\n\\nShe's a former physical education teacher, and she knows the struggle educators face when there are minimal resources.\\n\\nYou don't need equipment to have recess, Carter says. If you have a place for them to go and you have adult supervision and this plan in place, you can have recess for students."}

They were told their tickets will cost not $16 — but $25,000.\\n\\nWhen Adam Ballard saw what Amtrak wanted to charge, he couldn't believe it.\\n\\nI thought it was a mistake. That's the price of a car, Ballard says. How can that be possible? I was sure it was a mistake. But I've seen it in writing. So I know it's not.\\n\\nBallard works for a disability service and advocacy center in Chicago called Access Living. He is its housing and transportation policy analyst, and a group from his office is headed to Bloomington next Wednesday for a work retreat.\\n\\nThere are 10 of them, and five — including Ballard — use wheelchairs. Their train has three cars. Each car has one space for a wheelchair. That makes three spaces for five people in wheelchairs. In the past, when Access Living gave advance notice that it was sending a large group, Amtrak took out more seats to fit more wheelchairs. Once, it took out seats in the dining car and charged a few hundred dollars extra.\\n\\nI use a power wheelchair. It is standard size for a power chair, but it's larger than most manual chairs. So I take up a little extra space, Ballard says. But always in the past, no matter what kind of assortment of people and devices we had together for our group, it was never a problem to get everybody on board.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vivian McCall for NPR Vivian McCall for NPR\\n\\nBut not this time.\\n\\nOn Dec. 30, an Amtrak agent for group sales based in Philadelphia wrote: I received a cost regarding the removal of seats and I've been advised this will be over $25 K. Would you like for me to proceed with the request?\\n\\nSomeone from the group wrote back: Am I reading this correctly?\\n\\nThe answer came back on Jan. 2. The cost is correct, the agent wrote, citing a new policy for taking out those seats. The agent explained that it's expensive to take out extra seats and that it means taking a car out of service.\\n\\nWith removal of seats, it can be quite costly, the agent wrote. In previous years, the removal of seats from the coach cars incurred fees that Amtrak absorbed ... We understand and appreciate your loyalty with Amtrak. Going forward, we cannot continue to absorb these fees. These polices have changed nationwide as of 2019.\\n\\nOfficials at Access Living then reached out to senior officials at Amtrak asking for a return to the prior arrangement, according to Bridget Hayman, director of communications for Access Living. She says Amtrak officials agreed to present the situation to upper management and give the disability group an answer by Jan. 13.\\n\\nBut there was no response by the promised deadline, Hayman says, and then no communication when officials at Access Living tried to follow up.\\n\\nJonathan Mook is an attorney who advises companies about their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. He was surprised by the $25,000 figure.\\n\\nThe $25,000 ... that's a Hobson's choice. It's no choice at all. Obviously, the group can't pay $25,000, Mook says.\\n\\nThe ADA, which became law 30 years ago this year, is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in jobs, schools, public places and transportation — including trains. It requires companies like Amtrak to make reasonable accommodations so that people with disabilities have comparable access to transportation as do people without disabilities. The law says a business can get an exemption from the requirement to make an accommodation if doing so would require an undue burden on the company.\\n\\nMook, who is with the Virginia-based law firm DiMuro Ginsberg, says that's mostly a protection for small businesses, or maybe for a big project — like a renovation that adds ramps and elevators to a historic train station.\\n\\nStill, he says, it's a gray area in the law to determine how much money a company is required to spend. But even if it really costs Amtrak $25,000 to take a train car out of service and pull up the seats, Mook says, that doesn't end the story ... [Amtrak] has to reach out and say, 'Let's talk about some alternatives here. What can we devise?' \\n\\nThat is what it did with Access Living in the past.\\n\\nNPR contacted Amtrak several times. One spokesperson noted that the policy about reconfiguring seats is not directed at people with disabilities but applies to anyone who makes a request that requires removing seating or making other physical changes to the service.\\n\\nThe official referred NPR to a page on Amtrak's website. It doesn't mention a new policy for people with disabilities or pulling up seats. At the top of the page it says: Amtrak is happy to provide accessible transportation to all of our guests.\\n\\nIn fact, many wheelchair users — like Adam Ballard — prefer trains to buses and airplanes.\\n\\nWe've looked at other options, like buses, Ballard says. And nothing compares to Amtrak.\\n\\nOn the train, the bathrooms are spacious, large enough to fit a wheelchair. And Ballard can stay in his wheelchair, instead of checking it like luggage — and then worrying that this expensive piece of equipment that is hard to fix and crucial to his mobility — will be damaged.\\n\\nBallard still plans to go to the meeting next week. Access Living is using one of its vans to take him and a colleague. The other eight people in the group will buy those $16 one-way tickets on the train.\\n\\nFor $25,000, they could buy more than 1,500 tickets.\\n\\nAfter publication of the NPR story, Amtrak released a statement reiterating its earlier comments that the charges were part of the company's policy to charge passengers an additional fee when any group requires reconfiguration of our railcars.\\n\\nThe statement went on to say: We will contact Access Living and suggest costs could be avoided by using the two separate trains on this route, with each train separated by about three hours and having three spaces for wheelchairs without any reconfiguration. We will also confirm the pricing for a railcar reconfiguration given to this important and valued customer.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran and double amputee, said in a series of tweets that she was disappointed that Amtrak appears to have failed to offer a public apology for its initial mistake.\\n\\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act has been the law of the land for 30 years, she said. Yet in 2020, @ Amtrak believes it would be an unreasonable burden to remove architectural barriers that would enable a group with five wheelchair users to travel together.\\n\\nDuckworth, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety, went on to say she planned to request a meeting with Amtrak President and CEO Richard Anderson to discuss eliminating Amtrak's nationwide policy of refusing to absorb any costs associated with reconfiguring a railcar to accommodate a group of wheelchair users."}

{"original": "A Pioneer In 'Flat-Fee Primary Care' Had To Close Its Clinics. What Went Wrong?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption BraunS /Getty Images BraunS /Getty Images\\n\\nIn recent years, a small but growing number of medical practices embraced a buffet approach to primary care, offering patients unlimited services for a modest flat fee — say, $50 to $150 per month — instead of billing them a la carte for every office visit and test.\\n\\nBut a pioneer in the field — Seattle-based Qliance — shut its public clinics as of June 15, and some health care analysts are questioning whether the approach to medical care is valid and viable.\\n\\nThis style of medical practice is called direct primary care, and many doctors and patients say they like the arrangement. Typically, these physicians don't accept insurance — which frees the doctors from having to get preapprovals from insurers on treatment and lets them skip the paperwork involved in insurance claims. Doctors say that allows them more time and energy for their patients.\\n\\nMeanwhile, patients say they like being able to consult with their doctor or a nurse practitioner as often as they need to, at a relatively low cost. (Some employers buy the service for their workers.) Patients who are signed up for the plan still need to carry a regular insurance plan (typically a high-deductible policy) to cover hospitalizations, consultations with specialists and other services.\\n\\nIn theory, the result should be better health for patients and lower health care costs overall.\\n\\nBut some who analyze the use of health care are concerned that the approach encourages the worried well to get more care than they need. They describe unlimited primary care as a blunt instrument that doesn't necessarily improve the odds that patients will get evidence-based services that improve their health. Others argue it's important to find a way to provide cost-effective primary care within the health insurance context, not outside it.\\n\\nAlthough only a sliver of medical practices operate this way, the number is on the rise, says Shawn Martin, a senior vice president at the American Academy of Family Physicians. He puts the figure at about 3 percent.\\n\\nQliance, founded in 2007, was an early leader in this type of care. With startup funding from high-profile investors Jeff Bezos and Michael Dell, the company was serving 35,000 patients at several clinics in the Seattle area by 2015. Those patients included individuals, workers at large companies like Expedia and Comcast, and Medicaid patients through a contract with the state's Medicaid insurer.\\n\\nIn a 2015 press release, Qliance said medical claims for its patients were 20 percent lower than those of other patients because, among other things, Qliance members went to the emergency room less often, were hospitalized less frequently and saw fewer specialists.\\n\\nBy early 2017, though, Qliance was faltering. The company had lost some of the big employers, and its patient base had shrunk to 13,000. Last week, it closed the last of its private clinics, though its CEO, Dr. Erika Bliss, will continue to operate one site that provides occupational health services for Seattle firefighters.\\n\\nIn general, Bliss says, the market is reluctant to pay what is required for primary care to flourish. In some cases, she says, payers were resistant to rewarding Qliance even when it exceeded its targets for quality and savings.\\n\\nThe bottom line is it's not for free, Bliss says.\\n\\nThe closure took January Gens, a 45-year-old Seattle resident, by surprise. A Qliance patient for a couple of years, Gens had worked with her primary care doctor to manage crippling pain from endometriosis. The $79 monthly fee was worth every penny, she thought. She had been able to reduce the dosage of some of her medications and was awaiting a referral to start physical therapy when she learned that Qliance was shutting down. Now she's not sure what she'll do.\\n\\nI had felt very lucky to have found Qliance, to know I had a doctor and could always be seen when needed without causing more damage to the family budget, Gens says. Now it's just gone.\\n\\nPatients who have chronic conditions that need ongoing management may benefit from this sort of flat-fee program, says Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, an internist who directs the University of Michigan's Center for Value-Based Insurance Design.\\n\\nBut for people who are generally healthy and without symptoms that need to be diagnosed, unlimited primary care is no guarantee that the services that are provided will improve the health of those people, he says.\\n\\nAs an example, Fendrick notes that the annual checkup — one of the most popular primary care services — isn't clinically helpful for most people, according to the Choosing Wisely initiative, a program of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation that identifies overused and unnecessary medical services.\\n\\nAn examination of research related to direct primary care practices, published in the November-December 2015 issue of the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, found that they charged patients an average $77.38 per month. In contrast, concierge or boutique medical practices — which are similar to direct primary care programs, but charge more — typically have higher fees for patients — averaging $182.76, the study found — and they generally also bill insurers for their services.\\n\\nHowever, there was a paucity of data related to the quality of care provided by these practices, the study found.\\n\\nSome analysts say that while they're sympathetic to doctors' frustration with insurance companies' intrusion into patient care and the billing hassles that go along with that, the answer isn't to turn their backs on insurance.\\n\\nI think, absolutely, this type of care could be done inside insurance, says Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute who specializes in health care delivery. But it means we have to learn how to pay within the system for the things that doctors should be doing — and are doing — in direct primary care.\\n\\nAs things stand now, the direct-care model can create difficulties for some patients. Take the situation in which someone in this sort of practice goes to his primary care provider for an earache, but antibiotics don't work and he needs to be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist. That patient, who likely has a high-deductible insurance policy to cover care that goes beyond the primary practitioner's purview, will probably be on the hook financially for the entire cost of medical services provided by the specialist — rather than insurance paying a share.\\n\\nQliance's Bliss scoffs at the idea that patients may get stuck paying more out of pocket if they have direct primary care. Most people these days have high-deductible health plans, she says. The reality is that, unless you have Medicaid, you are on the hook no matter what.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

{"original": "Low Snowpack In California Mountains May Mean More Wildfires This Summer\\n\\nThe snowpack in California is dangerously low. The state gets most of its water from snow melt that begins high in the Sierra Nevada. Low snowpack means a drier summer and potentially more wildfires.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nThis month is shaping up to be one of the driest Februarys in California's history. State water officials said today that snowpack across the Sierra Nevada is measuring less than half of what's normal for this time of year. That matters to skiers and snowboarders. But more critically, sunny skies in the winter could mean more wildfires come summer and fall. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Peter Arcuni reports.\\n\\nPETER ARCUNI, BYLINE: Armed with aluminum survey poles and electronic sensors, hydrologists in California flock to the Sierra Nevada each winter to measure snowpack. That's because about a third of the state's annual water supply for drinking and agriculture gets stored as snow.\\n\\nCHRIS ORRICK: Then when the snowpack starts to melt in the late spring, early summer, that water will hopefully slowly melt off and replenish the water that is held in our reservoirs.\\n\\nARCUNI: Chris Orrick is with the California Department of Water Resources. He says the dry winter is in stark contrast to last year.\\n\\nORRICK: It was probably one of the wettest Februarys we've ever had. Some areas of the Sierra accumulated up to 50 feet of snow, whereas this year, in the majority of the Central Valley and Northern California, we had a little to no measurable precipitation.\\n\\nARCUNI: The silver lining, Orrick says, is that the state's reservoirs still have plenty of water, thanks to all the snow and rain from last year. While officials aren't ready to declare a drought, a dry winter can signal an early start to California's wildfire season, which has devastated parts of the state in recent years.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The massive Carr Fire.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The Mendocino Complex.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The Atlas and Tubbs fires.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: The Camp Fire is now the most destructive fire in state history.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: The name that they've given to two fires that are close enough to one another that it essentially is one incident. And this fire is a monster. It is...\\n\\nARCUNI: The snowpack is an important insurance policy to protect against wildfire, says John Abatzoglou. He's a climatologist with the University of California, Merced.\\n\\nJOHN ABATZOGLOU: So that snowmelt provides a gradual source of moisture, keeping those fuels in our forested areas wet later into the spring and early summer. And so when we don't have the snowpack in place, when we have a subpar snowpack, those fuels are allowed to green up and actually dry out earlier in the year.\\n\\nARCUNI: And that, says Abatzoglou, sets the stage for an early start to fire season.\\n\\nABATZOGLOU: So California certainly has seen longer fire seasons lasting both later into the fall and starting early in the spring. And unfortunately, the lack of precipitation across the state - we basically struck out during the two wettest months of the year.\\n\\nARCUNI: A spokesman for Cal Fire, the agency responsible for fire prevention in California, says that the current dry, windy conditions have already contributed to more wildfires than usual this winter. But fire officials and water managers point out that California's wet season isn't over yet. They're hoping for a repeat of 2018, when a series of March storms replenished the snowpack in time for the spring runoff.\\n\\nFor NPR News, I'm Peter Arcuni in San Francisco.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "#MemeOfTheWeek: Shouting Politicans\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP\\n\\nDuring an exchange over how high to raise the minimum wage in Thursday night's Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders began to shout over each other, hands raised, fingers pointed, both seeming to get a bit red in the face, while the audience cheered and booed in equal parts.\\n\\nBernie: SHOUTING\\n\\nHillary: SHOUTING\\n\\nWolf: SHOUTING — Keith Reynolds (@keeftweet) April 15, 2016\\n\\nIt was quite a scene. As NPR's Ron Elving put it, Both Sanders and Clinton showed flashes of animosity bordering on contempt.\\n\\nModerator Wolf Blitzer of CNN tried several times to calm things down, saying, Secretary, Senator, please, over and over. Finally, he exclaimed, almost shouting himself, If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you. So please don't talk over each other.\\n\\nWolf Blitzer: If you are both screaming at each other the viewers won't be able to hear either of you #DemDebate https://t.co/O0Y3VqAi3J — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) April 15, 2016\\n\\nIt was the latest example of something we've seen over and over during this presidential campaign: candidates yelling — at themselves, their competition, moderators and even the audience — with the message getting lost in the process.\\n\\nOn Twitter, there were complaints about the noise. Some joked about the candidates' ages.\\n\\nHave we considered that Hillary and Bernie were shouting last night because their hearing aids weren't working? #OldPeoplesParty — KevinC (@ExurbanKevin) April 15, 2016\\n\\nAnd others seemed to touch on gender, and the way it might affect how different candidates are heard.\\n\\nTo everyone who's said Hillary was yelling: Bernie's quite a shouter himself. Ask yourself why you hear her shouting, and not him #DemDebate — Indira Lakshmanan (@Indira_L) April 15, 2016\\n\\nBernie is shouting more. And sounding more shrill tonight than Hillary. #DemDebate — D. Wil (@davidkwilson19) April 15, 2016\\n\\nFor months, the Democratic side of the presidential debate had been considered to conduct quieter, more restrained presidential debates. But the tables seemed to have turned this week. Democrats were at their fieriest yet, and the Republican contenders are coming off a week of family filled town halls and a recent debate that seemed to focus a lot on policy instead of hand size and insulting nicknames.\\n\\nSo the Dem debate was full of shouting & the GOP debate is full of calm discourse? Did everyone hire the same consultant? #GOPDebate — Roger Simon (@politicoroger) March 11, 2016\\n\\nIn the run-up to Tuesday's New York primary, Clinton and Sanders have been engaged in multiple battles — over who's more New York, who's more qualified, and who can make the most change.\\n\\nWe may have to add another battle to this list — which of these two is the loudest."}
{"original": "Will The Real Donald Trump Please Stand Up?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Julie Jacobson/AP Julie Jacobson/AP\\n\\nLately, it's been a political guessing game of which Donald Trump is going to show up.\\n\\nIn the past 24 hours alone, the whiplash between what rival-turned-uneven-surrogate Ben Carson called the two different Donald Trumps was on bold display.\\n\\nFrom a serious foreign policy address in the morning, he returned just hours later to his regular slapstick mockery of his rivals. But as Trump moves even closer to securing his party's White House nomination, the unpredictable dichotomy is one that's sure to worry GOP leaders, anxious over which Trump will show up when it matters most in November.\\n\\nOn Wednesday evening, it was pure, unfiltered Trump who took the stage in Indiana. Hoosier legend, former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight (whose own temper is controversial in itself), introduced him, endorsing the real estate mogul as the most prepared man in history to step in as president of the United States.\\n\\nThere has never been a more honest politician than Donald Trump, said Knight, who was fired from IU in 2000 after uncivil, defiant and unacceptable behavior that included allegedly choking a player.\\n\\nThey say he isn't presidential. I don't know what the hell that means, Knight thundered to loud applause.\\n\\nTrump's speech that followed was largely of the mold that many GOP leaders worry is decidedly unpresidential. The mocking of Ohio Gov. Kasich's eating habits was a staple. He again berated Ted Cruz, boasting that he has won evangelical voters this cycle while Cruz holds up the Bible, puts it down, and then he lies.\\n\\nAnd even though he had some kind words about the Fourth Estate after his Tuesday night landslide, Trump was back to calling the press corps following him the world's most dishonest people on Wednesday evening in Indiana. The crowd, as usual, ate it up and joined along in the jeers.\\n\\nJust a week earlier, there seemed to be a shift in Trump land. Ever since the GOP presidential front-runner hired political strategist Paul Manafort to helm his maligned delegate operation, the longtime Republican hand has tried to telegraph the message that the controversial reality TV star would eventually evolve and tone down his temper and tenor on the campaign trail.\\n\\nThat promise seemed to have been fulfilled after Trump's landslide win in New York last week. In a more subdued victory speech at Trump Tower, he was cordial to his bitter rival Cruz, even referring to him as senator instead of the Lyin' Ted moniker he's bestowed on him.\\n\\nBut a week later, that collegiality was gone after Trump himself pushed back on the idea that any change was forthcoming. Campaigning in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania ahead of his sweep of five states Tuesday, Trump was back to insults and his usual freewheeling, unpredictable style. That's where he premiered his critique of his struggling rival Kasich's eating style on the campaign trail.\\n\\nHe has the news conference all the time when he's eating. I've never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion, Trump thundered.\\n\\nAfter his big wins on Tuesday — which possibly put him on an irreversible path toward winning the GOP nomination — Trump was back to a more unplugged style.\\n\\nTurning an eye toward the general election and likely rival Hillary Clinton, he went hard after the Democrat for playing the woman's card. It was a new line of attacks that likely worry many party strategists as they seek to woo the important female voting bloc in November, among whom Trump has high unfavorables in general election polling.\\n\\nIf Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she would get 5 percent of the vote, he jabbed at the end of his remarks. Calling in to news shows the next morning, he continued that line of criticism.\\n\\nLater Wednesday afternoon, however, a more presidential sounding and looking Donald Trump showed up. Giving a major foreign policy speech in Washington, he was far more straight-laced, reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter.\\n\\nHere's how NPR's Domenico Montanaro described it:\\n\\nThe speech was more a litany of what Trump doesn't think has worked rather than a prescription of specifics — he did not mention his wall with Mexico and only alluded to his call for a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the U.S. But his 38-minute remarks did offer a peek into Trump's worldview, a window into a 'Trump Doctrine' that is reflexively protectionist, against nation-building — underlined by the slogan 'America First' — and reliant on a backbone of military strength. It also gave Trump the opportunity to appear more serious and less bombastic. If there are two Trumps, as Ben Carson has said, this was 'Presidential Trump.' There were no 'Lyin' Ted' references or mocking of John Kasich's eating habits.\\n\\nJust hours later though, he was back to his usual routine — for the most part. There was one subtle instance of restraint during his Indiana rally Wednesday night. He still took glee in mocking Cruz's decision to tap Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential pick even though the Texas senator is mathematically unable to get enough delegates on the first convention ballot.\\n\\nBut he refrained from any overt attacks on Fiorina herself, a departure from last fall, when he derided her appearance.\\n\\nOverall, Trump perhaps summed up his philosophy best during his Trump Tower victory speech Tuesday night: If you have a football team, and you're winning, and then you get to the Super Bowl, you don't change your quarterback, right?\\n\\nTrump may take a knee more often on the campaign trail and give voters flashes of that more subdued version of himself. But Wednesday alone demonstrated he's going to continue to blitz in his own way, like it or not, for the foreseeable future."}
{"original": "U.S. Hospitals Prepare For A COVID-19 Wave\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Kaste/NPR Martin Kaste/NPR\\n\\nAs the coronavirus spreads in the U.S., public health agencies are starting to worry about hospital capacity.\\n\\nOverseas, China was forced to build two new hospitals on an emergency basis, and in South Korea earlier this week, the government said over two thousand people were waiting for hospital care.\\n\\nThe potential numbers in the U.S. are daunting. Richard Waldhorn is a pulmonary critical care physician who's studied hospital preparedness for the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Last week, he co-wrote an article arguing that American hospitals should prepare for the possibility of too many patients.\\n\\nThe arithmetic suggests that we will outstrip hospital resources, particularly instensive care resources, in waves as the pandemic spreads, he says.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Kaste/Martin Kaste Martin Kaste/Martin Kaste\\n\\nHe says government planning assumptions based on past flu pandemics suggest a surge in demand for intensive care that could range somewhere between 200,000 thousand and 2.9 million patients.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association says the total number of Intensive Care Unit beds is about 65,000.\\n\\nWaldhorn says hospitals can make more ICU beds available in a crisis, perhaps doubling the capacity, but there's still a chance it won't be enough.\\n\\nWe're going to have to face the problem of how do we allocate limited health care resources in some sort of rational and ethical and organized way with the goal of doing the greatest good for the greatest number, he says.\\n\\nHe gives the example of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a technique for oxygenating blood outside the body, in cases of respiratory failure. Chinese doctors reported some success using the procedure to keep COVID-19 patients alive, but it's not something that could be easily provided to hundreds or thousands of patients.\\n\\nIn Washington State, things have not yet reached the stage of tough choices.\\n\\nEvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland identified the country's first fatal case of COVID-19 last Friday, and since then it's borne the brunt of the most serious cases — and most of the country's deaths. Many stem from the outbreak at the nearby Life Care nursing facility.\\n\\nOne week later, the hospital has made plans to house even more of the patients, by taking steps such as converting more sections of its buildings into negative pressure wards, in which HVAC systems keep germs from spreading. Still, they're feeling the strain.\\n\\nRight now I know for certain, we have one critical care bed left, the CEO, Jeff Tomlin, said on Thursday night. We're right now already talking to the other facilities to see what their capacity is.\\n\\nOther hospitals in the region are preparing for the possibility of that overflow by designating floors or wings to be used for cohorts of COVID-19 patients, which would allow more efficiency in caring for groups of them, especially given the cumbersome protective suits that medical workers have to wear when treating them.\\n\\nSome nurses in the Seattle area and California have complained about a shortage of protective gear, especially N95 masks. The union representing nurses at EvergreenHealth said many of them didn't have sufficient supplies of protective gear, and didn't have enough orientation for how to safely handle suspected coronavirus cases.\\n\\nIn Washington State, officials say they've received more masks and other protective gear from the federal government, to help alleviate the shortage.\\n\\nA complicating factor is that even without COVID-19, this has been a bad flu season. Many American hospitals have been running close to capacity, says Mahshid Abir, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and an emergency physician at the University of Michigan.\\n\\nWe in the last few weeks, in our health care system, have gotten multiple notifications of the hosptial being at full capacity. And I would say this is not unusual for most academic centers across the U.S., Abir says.\\n\\nShe blames this in part on the fact that many Americans with poor access to health care don't come in until they're very sick, which adds to the burden for emergency departments and ICU's.\\n\\nNow, as coronavirus fears spread, she predicts an even bigger load on hospitals.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Kaste/Martin Kaste Martin Kaste/Martin Kaste\\n\\nI think we're going to see a lot of anxiety, and it will be not all coronavirus, necessary. It could be a lot of people who are the 'worried well,' she says.\\n\\nWhile most people who get the virus suffer only mild symptoms, there's a subset that will need critical care. If the overall infection rate is large, that subset could be very numerous.\\n\\nIn anticipation, hospitals in the Seattle area are trying to clear more beds.\\n\\nWe should not have people in the hospitals who do not need hospital care and there's a lot of them, says Cassie Sauer, CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association.\\n\\nThe association has long argued that too many people take up beds after treatment because there's no place for them to go — such as long-term care. Sauer says the COVID-19 crisis has focused minds on moving those patients out.\\n\\nWe are working very closely with the state and with the health insurers to say, 'Those people need to be moved out,' she says. That's the number one way to create capacity.\\n\\nIn the meantime, public health officials in Washington State are implementing a strategy of trying to flatten the anticipated wave of patients.\\n\\nKing County, site of the biggest known American outbreak of COVID-19, is setting up modular housing and repurposing a motel to house patients with milder symptoms. The goal is to keep them from swamping the hospitals, while still keeping them isolated, to slow the rate of infection in the general population.\\n\\nAt EvergreenHealth, Francis Riedo is a big believer in the flatten the wave strategy. He's the infectious disease specialist who last week made the call to test two patients suffering from unexplained severe respiratory disease, which ended up identifying the country's first COVID-19 death. Since then, he's been emailing colleagues around the country, advising them to do the same.\\n\\nStart looking now, he says. Go out and find your high-risk, critically-ill patients with unexplained, undiagnosed infections, and start testing them.\\n\\nHe says it'll be better — and the wave of patients will be flatter — if hospitals act sooner.\\n\\nYou may have another two weeks, you may have another four weeks, he says. Be ready now."}
{"original": "Vatican Sex Crimes Investigator On Summit\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nArchbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta is the Vatican's top sex crimes investigator. He joins us now from Rome.\\n\\nWelcome to the program.\\n\\nCHARLES SCICLUNA: Thank you. Thank you, Lulu.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The pope ended the summit calling for all-out battle against abuse by priests. What does that mean?\\n\\nSCICLUNA: It means that the guidelines we have, the laws we have need to be implemented across the board. But it also means a change of heart. He talked about conversion because this is a fight against one of the greatest evils. And this is, obviously, theological language. But it is a very important language for us. The pope, actually, put the abuse of kids and cover-up of that abuse on the same level of gravity. And we need to get it right.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What are the next steps though? For example, former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was defrocked earlier this month. In fact, you were instrumental in that decision. Victims want zero tolerance and that all priests who are found guilty have the same thing happen. Will it?\\n\\nSCICLUNA: Well, first of all, that is the law for the United States of America and Canada. Victims also need to be reminded that we need to be reminded of the very important words by Saint John Paul II, who said that people should know that there is no place in the priesthood for anybody who would harm the young, who would harm our kids. And this has to be the way forward.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So you think that the pope now will embrace that for every single diocese in the world.\\n\\nSCICLUNA: I think that the quote from Saint John Paul II has been policy since 2002. Now we need to audit ourselves in order to make sure that that is the case.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you saying that this needs to happen everywhere now? When a priest has been convicted of a sex crime, he should be defrocked everywhere.\\n\\nSCICLUNA: I wouldn't say defrocked. He should not be in ministry. And that is something that people need to know. He will not be in parishes. He will not be around with kids.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You have been working on clerical sex abuse cases for decades. You are the top investigator now. Under Benedict, now Pope Emeritus, you were the church's top sex crimes prosecutor, before that, the Vatican's promoter of justice. And yet this problem persists. Why has it persisted? And is there something that you think should've been done earlier?\\n\\nSCICLUNA: Well, sin will always be with us. And crime will always happen. I don't think that we can guarantee that no unfortunate incident of sex abuse will ever happen again. But we will do whatever it takes to prevent it from happening. This is something that we owe our church, we owe our faith community. Yet...\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Are there any regrets on your part, though, Archbishop? - because the church is in crisis.\\n\\nSCICLUNA: Well, I think crisis is also an opportunity. And I think that this is a moment where we need to listen to the victims, to the communities there asking that we get it right. This will not go away easily. This will create a lot of hurt. But the United States has moved - I'm talking about the Catholic Church in the United States - has moved forward since 2002. The United States Catholic Church is an example of good practice.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Archbishop, why should anyone trust that the church will do anything different? We're talking tens of thousands of victims - conservatively - a culture of secrecy that hid crimes, that protected abusers, that silenced victims. These new revelations continue. Why should they trust the church?\\n\\nSCICLUNA: That is a legitimate question. We need to own our credibility on a day by day basis. And there is no easy way to be credible but doing the right thing.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, thank you so much.\\n\\nSCICLUNA: Thank you.

No one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now.\\n\\nThe White House's coronavirus task force detailed the modeling and other data that compelled President Trump to extend virus countermeasures deeper into the spring.\\n\\nFauci and another top physician, Dr. Deborah Birx, renewed their pleas for Americans to observe social distancing and other precautions to try to depress the rate of infections and deaths.\\n\\nThis is not a number we need to accept. We can influence this to a varying degree, Fauci said.\\n\\nTrump, however, suggested that he has been told that 100,000 could be a floor and not the ceiling.\\n\\nThey're very sobering, yeah, the president said of the estimates. When you see 100,000 people and that's a minimum number ... and they said it's unlikely you'll be able to attain that. Think of what would have happened if we didn't do anything.\\n\\nHard days lie ahead\\n\\nThe president had earlier described an imaginary scene of full church pews on Easter Sunday — but then acknowledged Sunday that federal guidelines for social distancing and other mitigation measures would need to remain in place through April 30.\\n\\nIt's life and death, frankly, Trump said. It's a matter of life and death.\\n\\nPublic health officials warn that infections and deaths may not peak for the next few weeks; it isn't clear when, except that the disaster will get worse.\\n\\nI want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead, Trump said. This is going to be three weeks that we haven't seen before.\\n\\nTask force members used Tuesday's briefing to detail the metrics that informed those warnings and that prompted Trump to extend the countermeasure guidelines.\\n\\nThe blue mountain\\n\\nBirx showed reporters at the White House on Tuesday a chart that showed what she called a blue mountain of deaths hitting a peak of around 2.2 million — a projection of what could have taken place without any countermeasures at all.\\n\\nSocial distancing and other protocols cause that estimated curve to be shorter in height, which is why they're so essential, Birx said. She and Fauci said the models they've cited still were subject to change based on the ongoing response.\\n\\nBut she also warned that the stark reality of the coronavirus justifies the grave warning Trump gave and underscores why she said Americans must continue to isolate and take the other precautionary measures.\\n\\nThe United States is still climbing the statistical curve of infections as the virus spreads into and within new regions such as the South and the Midwest. A statistical curve of mortality will follow and likely abate over a longer period of time, officials say.\\n\\nAmericans must continue to stay home, keep apart, wash their hands and take the other steps that public health officials have urged, Birx said.\\n\\nIt's communities that will do this, she said. There's no magic bullet. There's no magic vaccine or therapy. It's just behaviors.\\n\\nIn terms of the types of countermeasures required, the officials said nothing more is likely needed beyond what's already recommended: the closure of restaurants, businesses and other public places; avoiding groups; washing hands; and so forth.\\n\\nWe hope it's enough, Trump said. We hope we're at a level where we can say, 'Let's go.' \\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nThe number of test-confirmed cases nationwide is nearing 200,000, and more than 3,800 Americans have died as of Tuesday evening, per Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nFauci told reporters that the coming weeks' worth of data might be grim, but he said that the nation must hold fast. Data from Washington state and elsewhere show that social distancing makes the statistical curves shorter in height and stops transmissions.\\n\\nWe're going to continue to see things go up, Fauci said. We cannot be discouraged by that, because the mitigation is actually working.\\n\\nThe United States, he added, can't take its foot off the accelerator and put it onto the brakes — I know that's what we can do over the next 30 days.\\n\\nLife in isolation\\n\\nAmericans in many places are under more stringent restrictions than those in the federal guidelines. Governors and mayors have ordered people to stay at home and business to close through May and into June in some cases.\\n\\nOthers, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, haven't yet. Trump was asked Tuesday whether he'd get involved with those leaders' decisions.\\n\\nNot unless he felt that was necessary, the president said.

{"original": "A Travel Ban To Contain The Coronavirus Could Worsen Conditions In Wuhan\\n\\nChina is enforcing travel restrictions on several cities, affecting millions of people. But research shows that these measures are not effective. In fact, they might make the situation even worse.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nChina is taking some extraordinary measures in an effort to stop the spread of a potentially deadly coronavirus. The government has suspended travel in and out of some cities where the virus may be circulating. But as NPR science correspondent Joe Palca reports, these extreme steps might actually be counterproductive.\\n\\nJOE PALCA, BYLINE: The Chinese outbreak started in the city of Wuhan. So it may seem obvious that if you want to keep a contagious virus from spreading from Wuhan to, say, Beijing, you simply ban people from traveling from Wuhan to Beijing. Obvious, yes, but public health experts will tell you that there are several reasons why it doesn't work.\\n\\nCATHERINE WORSNOP: The first is that they may not actually be effective for stopping spread.\\n\\nPALCA: Catherine Worsnop is at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. First of all, she says, travel bans don't work because they come too late.\\n\\nWORSNOP: The bans were put in place after many people had already left Wuhan and other cities, so it had already had a chance to spread.\\n\\nPALCA: You can't put a ban in place before there's a reason to put a ban in place. And by then, it's too late. What's more, Worsnop says people will try to sneak out of the city.\\n\\nWORSNOP: That can make it much harder to track potential cases and contact, which is one of the most effective ways to contain this outbreak.\\n\\nPALCA: And if you prevent people and goods from moving in or out of an affected city, shortages of food and medicine and medical equipment can occur. Worsnop says besides the practical problems travel bans cause, there are also psychological impacts.\\n\\nWORSNOP: These extreme measures domestically have raised worries that the government has not actually been fully transparent about this outbreak.\\n\\nPALCA: Worsnop says the Chinese government had been sending the message that things were pretty much under control. The surprising decision to implement extensive travel bans suggests just the opposite. And this can have ripple effects around the world.\\n\\nWORSNOP: The worries about a lack of transparency could actually contribute to incentives that other countries already have to impose their own border measures.\\n\\nPALCA: Worsnop says other countries may feel that they need to do something and may consider their own travel restrictions.\\n\\nLawrence Gostin is a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. He agrees a travel ban is not the solution to China's problems.\\n\\nLAWRENCE GOSTIN: I think it's a very significant mistake, and it will be counterproductive from a public health point of view.\\n\\nPALCA: Gostin cites the experience with two other outbreaks, SARS and MERS, caused by a virus similar to the one that's cropped up in China.\\n\\nGOSTIN: We never had lockdowns with all of those, but we brought them under control with traditional public health measures.\\n\\nPALCA: Those include things like educating people about the symptoms of an infection with the virus, urging people to report such symptoms immediately and tracking those who come in contact with people who got sick.\\n\\nThere's one more key element to successfully responding to a disease outbreak. Don't panic. Gostin says that's especially true for people living in this country who might be worried about the outbreak in China.\\n\\nGOSTIN: The risk is extraordinarily low for people in the United States.\\n\\nPALCA: With reasonable precautions, Gostin says it should stay that way. And Catherine Worsnop says the situation in China is a reminder of something that's well known to anyone who works in public health.\\n\\nWORSNOP: Prevention is more effective than response once an outbreak actually occurs.\\n\\nPALCA: It's a lesson people seem to need to learn over and over and over.\\n\\nJoe Palca, NPR News.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "In A Border Region Where Immigrants Are Wary, A Health Center Travels To Its Patients\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christina Chung for NPR Christina Chung for NPR\\n\\nOur Take A Number series is exploring problems around the world through the lens of a single number.\\n\\nIt's about 7 p.m. on a chilly night, and Sirene Garcia is standing outside an apartment building about an hour's drive from Rochester, N.Y.\\n\\nEven though Garcia has had a cold for the past few days, she has her laptop perched on the hood of her car, trying to test out the new telehealth program. Once the program kicks off, Finger Lakes Community Health's doctors and nurse practitioners will be able to see patients at their homes through video calls.\\n\\nAnd there are a lot of patients who could use this: The center serves some 9,000 farm workers in this region near the Canadian border.\\n\\nBut all of that depends tonight on whether or not Garcia, the center's special programs director, can find a decent Internet connection.\\n\\nCan you hear me OK? Garcia says to her laptop, garbled sound spitting back at her through the speakers. She's on a video call with one of her colleagues who's based at one of FLCH's eight locations.\\n\\nThe Finger Lakes region, well-known for its rolling farmland and vineyards, is also home to a diverse and sizable refugee and immigrant population.\\n\\nMost of the challenges that plague FLCH revolve around place, and the issue of spotty cell and Internet service is no different. The rural communities FLCH serve include Mennonites, refugees from Burma and immigrants from China, Saudi Arabia, Haiti and Mexico. Yet being in rural places means potential patients may often be isolated, low-income and not have easy access to transportation — and therefore difficult to serve.\\n\\nMary Zelazny, the health center's CEO, says they've come up with a variety of approaches to trying to crack the location puzzle, including providing transportation to patients, and providing in-camp services, where doctors or nurse practitioners visit patients' homes, often accompanied by translators or community outreach workers.\\n\\nIncluding the farm workers, the organization serves about 27,000 patients overall.\\n\\nAnd in a region so close to the border, a big fear for many of the farm workers is the heavy presence of the Border Patrol. Many fear being out on the roads for things like going to the doctor, so the telehealth clinic offers a chance to reach them in a safe place.\\n\\nWe just have more presence here of border patrol, Zelazny says. I don't ask any patients that come into my health centers what their immigration status is, because I don't care. My job, and my team's job, is to make sure that we give them the best healthcare they can get.\\n\\nThe organization's eight clinics are within 100 miles from the Canadian border. By U.S. law, Border Patrol can board — and search — any vehicle within a reasonable distance of the the border.\\n\\nAnd so if the patients can't get to health care, Zelazny says, then the clinic will come to them.\\n\\nOne the patients being served tonight is Pablo Lopez, 42, who came to the U.S. from Oaxaca two weeks earlier on a temporary work visa. Lopez, who's been to the U.S. seven times in as many years, said that when he first came, he was worried. On TV, he'd seen reports about immigration, the police and language barriers that were alarming.\\n\\nZelazny says that, throughout the years, even her own staff — many of whom are people of color — have been stopped by agents. And for a lot of farmworkers, regardless of their citizenship status, any run-ins with law enforcement cause a lot of anxiety.\\n\\nYou know, there's just this fear factor that makes everything harder, Zelazny says. They don't know what's going to happen to them. You hear a lot of stories, and they may not be true, but some of them are.\\n\\nAt a training for the new pilot telehealth program earlier in the day, Terri Hannon, a nurse practitioner, says she was at a dairy farm recently, giving vaccinations. A farmer came up to her, Hannon recalls, and he stated that his farm workers are very frightened and won't leave the farm at all — not to go to the grocery store, or Walmart or medical appointments.\\n\\nHannon's and her colleagues have heard similar things from patients they've visited.\\n\\nOrlando O'Neill, one of the health center's outreach coordinators, thinks the new video program will help.\\n\\nThey're afraid to come health center — even if they're sick or ill, O'Neill says. This will be a good tool for them.\\n\\nThe program will eliminate the need to travel at least an hour to the health clinics, and it'll keep the patients from having to take time out of their days.\\n\\nSara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, points to the public health issues at stake: Keeping your patients feeling that they can trust that using the health center services will not expose them is a huge, huge challenge."}
{"original": "Why Trade Is An Important Issue In the Presidential Campaign\\n\\nSteve Inskeep talks to Dartmouth Economist Douglas Irwin about the perceptions and realities of trade policy in the current political primary season.\\n\\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\\n\\nOf the states voting for presidential candidates today, Michigan is the biggest prize. It's a state sensitive to debates over trade.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nA poll shows 60 percent of Michigan Republicans want more trade restrictions on China, just to give one example that may help to explain why the candidates talk so much about trade.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBERNIE SANDERS: Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of these disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON: I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, this will help raise your wages. And I concluded I could not.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP: Does Mexico come here and build a plant in the United States? We lose a fortune with every deal we have.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are among those critiquing trade deals from NAFTA, 20 years ago, to the Trans-Pacific Partnership now.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And Douglas Irwin has been following all this and more. He's a Dartmouth College economist who specializes in trade policy. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nDOUGLAS IRWIN: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nINSKEEP: What really is making trade such a potent issue in both parties?\\n\\nIRWIN: Well, historically that's really been the case. We think back to 1992 when Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot ran on an anti-NAFTA platform. In 2008, Barack Obama ran against NAFTA - 2012, Mitt Romney raised issues with China. So trade has always been a sensitive issue in American politics because jobs are at stake.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And you say jobs are at stake. In what way is that really true? You mentioned NAFTA. It's more than 20 years old now. Is there enough evidence to say whether free trade deals cost American jobs or add American jobs or something else?\\n\\nIRWIN: Well, trade does destroy jobs in import-competing sectors, such as apparel and furniture. But so does technological change. And it also has to be pointed out that trade creates jobs in export-oriented sectors, such as aircraft and high-tech. So trade doesn't affect the number of jobs in the United States so much as it affects the composition of jobs. And unfortunately, some of those jobs are located in Ohio and Michigan, where heavy industry has traditionally been.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Which makes sense. Does it affect how much people can get paid? Are there higher-paying jobs being destroyed for lower-paying jobs?\\n\\nIRWIN: Actually, it's sort of the opposite. A lot of the jobs that are being destroyed in apparel and furniture were low-paying jobs. And a lot of the jobs that are being created are in aircraft and high-tech - are high-paying jobs. But still that said, wages have been flat even though total compensation is up because health care costs are taking that wedge, that bite out of people's paycheck. So people don't think they've been getting a pay increase at all.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, tell me about something else that I think is in peoples' heads and that is part of the argument here. There's a sense that jobs may well be created. But jobs are also destroyed. People are thrown out of work. And the people who are really profiting are investors or stockholders. It may be good for the broader economy to do a trade deal. But it's really people at the top who are benefiting. Is that statistically true?\\n\\nIRWIN: Well, people at the top have been benefiting. But it's not so much because of trade. If you look at the people in top 1 percent in law and entertainment, financial services, it's not because of international trade so much. And we sometimes forget that consumers and, particularly, downstream industries really benefit from imports. A lot of the imports that we bring into the country are needed by our manufacturing industries as inputs into production.\\n\\nINSKEEP: For example, if we're talking about the auto manufacturing industry, which is centered in Michigan. They may get auto parts out of a Mexican factory, just to give one example.\\n\\nIRWIN: Absolutely. And even our candy and confectionery industry depends on cheap sugar. And we have a sugar policy that keeps out cheap sugar. Marco Rubio from Florida defends that. But we've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in our candy and confectionery industry.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So we have a wide range of trade positions. Donald Trump has very loudly denounced NAFTA and other trade deals, has said the United States has done a terrible job of negotiating them. Bernie Sanders has a position on this. He's very skeptical of trade deals. Hillary Clinton favored the idea of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But does not like the reality. We could go on for some time. What is the basic difference here as you follow the different campaigns? What are the sides?\\n\\nIRWIN: Well, it's very interesting. Both parties have this division within them. Interestingly, public opinion polls suggest that Democrats support trade more than Republicans. But the Democratic candidates are speaking more to their union base in the party and opposing these trade agreements. Meanwhile, the Republicans traditionally have been, in recent decades, much more in favor of free trade. But the Republican base does not support trade as much. And now you see some candidates moving in that direction as well.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Wow. Are you saying that on both sides the interest groups within the party are in a different place than the mass of voters within the party?\\n\\nIRWIN: Well, it's a matter of degree. But it is surprising that in public opinion polls, Democrats tend to support trade more than Republicans, despite what you'd expect from the party leadership, which would be exactly the opposite.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Professor Irwin, thanks very much.\\n\\nIRWIN: You're welcome.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College, we reached him by Skype.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

{"original": "Passing The Torch, California Gov. Jerry Brown Tells Newsom, 'Don't Screw It Up'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP\\n\\nDepending on how you interpreted Gavin Newsom's campaign slogan Courage For a Change, he either has more courage than Jerry Brown — his campaign says that's not what they meant — or that Newsom has the courage needed to bring about big changes.\\n\\nFor a man who often struggled to win Brown's praise or even his attention, it's an attempt to promise fresh ideas and perhaps a willingness to embrace issues the outgoing governor left for others, such as single-payer health care.\\n\\nEither way, Newsom could be challenged by a possible economic downturn and a newly emboldened California Legislature with massive majorities in both houses.\\n\\nIf you're looking for timidity, I'm not your person, Newsom said before the election. If you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous, lean into issues, change the order of things, I'm committing myself to that cause as the next governor.\\n\\nNewsom takes office Monday, bringing to the state capital a very different style and set of priorities. Journalists often referred to Gov. Jerry Brown as the adult in the room when he huddled with legislators to close their differences. It was not a label legislators much cared for.\\n\\nI would resent it, too, if I was the Legislature, Brown told KQED, insisting he never said that. The governor said he expected legislators would push back against the next governor in ways they did not with him.\\n\\nWhen he became governor in 2011, Brown said legislators were willing to embrace a cooperative approach partially because the economy was bad. He added that he appreciated how lawmakers worked with him to solve problems and to compromise when necessary.\\n\\nAs things get easier, then people get more restive, and I think there is a desire for the Legislature to assert [itself], Brown said. Gavin will have his challenges, but he's older now than I was when I left the first time, he said, referring to the end of his second term in 1983. Brown said Newsom's age and experience will serve him well.\\n\\nOver the years, Newsom has shown a tendency to get out in front of issues.\\n\\nIn February 2004, he had been mayor of San Francisco for about a month when he made a bold — some would say reckless — decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. For weeks on end, hundreds of couples from all over the state and nation lined up to get married.\\n\\nThe California Supreme Court soon put a stop to the weddings, but four years later, it ruled 4-3 that preventing same-sex couples from marrying violated the state constitution. It helped pave the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision 10 years later legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\\n\\nTo his growing number of supporters, it also signaled Newsom's willingness to push the envelope.\\n\\nI think he's a risk taker, and I think he's a true intellectual believer in the notion that you can fail fast as long as you're moving forward, says Joyce Newstat, Newsom's policy director in the early part of his mayoralty.\\n\\nA risk taker\\n\\nNewsom's penchant for taking risks may have its roots in his childhood. He was not a particularly good student and was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia. Figuring out how to compensate for that learning disability was a gift, he says.\\n\\nYou know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. I had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently, Newsom told KQED. It allowed me to think outside the box. I've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.\\n\\nWhether it was outside the box thinking, political courage or just trying to keep his name in the headlines while he was lieutenant governor, Newsom helped lay the groundwork for a statewide ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.\\n\\nI think Gavin Newsom has demonstrated a really deep understanding of where the zeitgeist is going, says technology forecaster and Stanford University professor, Paul Saffo. He sees Newsom as fitting in well with the attitude of innovators in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nSaffo says Newsom seems to share what he calls their disrespect for authority. The entrepreneurs' creed is that it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.\\n\\nThat tendency in Newsom was not always appreciated. After his first marriage fell apart, he had an affair with a top aide's wife. Some felt he often seemed bored being mayor; spending too much time thinking about his political future including a run for governor a decade ago.\\n\\nI'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier, Paul Saffo says, adding that Newsom's eight years watching political master Jerry Brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. I suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever.\\n\\nPassing the torch\\n\\nAt age 51, Gavin Newsom is 30 years younger than the outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown and totally different in style and temperament.\\n\\nThis transition is really a passing of the torch, not just of one governor to another but from one generation to another, says former California Gov. Gray Davis. It's great that they have different styles. It's almost by necessity you have to govern for the times.\\n\\nNewsom is taking over a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world, and he has ambitions to match. California has the nation's highest rate of childhood poverty, which Newsom wants to address. He also wants to reform the health care system and provide government-subsidized child care.\\n\\nBut he can't do it alone. He'll need help from people like Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\\n\\nRendon and Newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. Asked about Newsom's ambitious agenda, Rendon says that compared to Brown — who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform — the new governor has a wider range of policy interests.\\n\\nWhich I guess makes a lot of sense at the beginning of an administration, Rendon says.\\n\\nRendon declined to compare Newsom to Brown, saying only that they're both exceptionally thoughtful leaders.\\n\\nAs Brown prepares to exit, he's leaving the state flush with cash, including a rainy day fund of $14 billion. Brown's parting piece of advice for Newsom? Don't screw it up."}
{"original": "Where Brunch And Housing Segregation Collide\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christopher Cornelius/Flickr Creative Commons Christopher Cornelius/Flickr Creative Commons\\n\\nThere's been a lot of conversation lately about people of color dealing with only one in the room syndrome in the workplace. But in 2016, it's still remarkably easy to be the only person of color in any given social situation. My Code Switch teammate Gene Demby and I were talking about this yesterday. We've both been to parties in D.C., Philadelphia, LA — all majority nonwhite cities — where we at some point looked up and realized we were the only one in the room. We live in Chocolate City, for goodness' sake! How are we ending up at all these potlucks with nary another person of color around?\\n\\nTurns out, it's pretty easy. As the Washington Post's Christopher Ingraham put it, writing about a study on race and social circles released last year, the average black person's friend network is eight percent white, but the average white person's network is only one percent black. To put it another way: Blacks have ten times as many black friends as white friends. But white Americans have an astonishing 91 times as many white friends as black friends.\\n\\nOn Friday, Rajini Vaidyanathan of BBC News wrote about housing segregation in the United States. According to the Brookings Institution study that he references, more than half of blacks would have to move to achieve complete integration. Predictably, housing segregation leads to racially distinct social spaces even in the nation's most ostensibly diverse cities, and not just when it comes to schools or offices:\\n\\nIn my reporting across the United States I've seen this first hand — from Louisiana to Kansas, Alabama to Wisconsin, Georgia to Nebraska. In so many of these places people of other races simply don't mix, not through choice but circumstance. And if there's no interaction between races, it's harder for conversations on how to solve race problems to even begin.\\n\\nThis separation, Vaidyanathan says, isn't an accident; it's the end result of decades of governmental discrimination; from redlining, racial covenants and blockbusting. Decades on from the civil rights movement, many black and white Americans simply don't mix, he writes. And as the U.S. contends with race problems, getting to know each other better is one step in understanding and fixing some of those problems.\\n\\nThe consequences of housing segregation can be severe. Gene has written about the effects segregation can have on life expectancy, education and incarceration rates.\\n\\nThey can also be intimate and nebulous, and pop up in the most unexpected places, like a holiday party or a Sunday brunch. Statistically speaking, this isn't that surprising.\\n\\nOver at the Toast, Nicole Chung recently wrote about what it feels like to encounter casual racism in a room full of white friends and family members. Chung was at a post-Christmas dinner at her in-laws' when an acquaintance leaned over the dinner table to share her observation that Chung looks just like everyone on that show — Fresh Off the Boat — leaving Chung grasping for words. She hoped that someone would step in and say something, and when no one did, she realized that the pressure to make sure everyone keeps having a good time was on her:\\n\\nThe social pressure on people of color to keep the peace, not get mad, just make sure everyone keeps having a nice time — even when we hear these remarks in public, at our workplaces and schools, in our own homes and from our friends' mouths — can be overwhelming, bearing down on us in so many situations we do not see coming and therefore cannot avoid. What does our dignity matter, what do our feelings amount to, when we could embarrass white people we care about? When our white relatives or friends or colleagues might experience a moment's discomfort, anxiety, or guilt?\\n\\nReading Chung's piece reminded me of a potluck I was at in Philadelphia last summer with my then-boyfriend, who is white, and his crew of white friends. I had gotten back from the beach a few days earlier and was several shades darker than usual. Everyone was busy gossiping about their summer adventures when one guy turned to me and asked, So, did he realize you were black when he started dating you?\\n\\nIn that moment, my instinct was to say something snarky (Did he realize you were a doofus when he became your friend?). But like Chung, I didn't want to ruin a good time. So I laughed, poured myself a drink, and let everyone move on.\\n\\nIn the scheme of things, did I experience that socially awkward interaction as a trauma on the scale of white-flight-induced school budget shortages, or the redlining-driven concentration of poverty in black neighborhoods? Of course not. But if we're going to have conversations on the effects of housing segregation, it's worth understanding how the accumulation of decades of racially driven policy may have leached into every aspect of our lives, and how a thorough scrubbing may be in store."}

{"original": "TERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. One of the most audacious exercises in education reform is how journalist Dale Russakoff describes the plan to fix the schools in Newark, N.J., a city beset by poverty and violence. In 2010, Cory Booker, who was then mayor of Newark and is now a U.S. senator, wanted to create a series of reforms in the Newark schools that could serve as a model for other cities.\\n\\nHe enlisted the support of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg donated $100 million with the understanding it would be matched by another 100 million from other sources. The optics were perfect - an African-American Democratic mayor, a white Republican governor and the cofounder of a social media giant come together to rescue the schools.\\n\\nRussakoff writes that almost everyone on all sides was well-intentioned, and that makes the failures, as well as the successes, of this five-year experiment important to wrestle with. Russakoff chronicles this experiment in school reform in her new book The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools. Dale Russakoff was a reporter for The Washington Post for 28 years, covering politics, education and social policy.\\n\\nDale Russakoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Can you give us a sense of where you think the Newark story fits into the larger story about the education reform movement in America?\\n\\nDALE RUSSAKOFF: Yes. I think this is one city where the ideas of the education reform movement were tried all in one place. Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, had the idea that just to bring of these ideas to one city and use the extraordinary powers of a governor who controlled that school district and the money from Mark Zuckerberg of a hundred million dollars to try everything that - as he said, what was working in the school reform movement. So in that view, it was dramatically expanding charter schools, getting rid of teachers whose evaluations found them to be weak, judging other teachers by their test scores and rewarding them and streamlining the management of the school district so that it ran more like a business.\\n\\nGROSS: So right from the start, there's a problem. Booker and Zuckerberg announce this gift of a hundred million dollars to reform the Newark schools. They announce it on Oprah.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: Which is great, but they hadn't told the community yet. So parents and teachers learn about this big reform movement that's about to hit them from Oprah's show. How did that play in the community?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, it played disastrously in the community because, immediately, nobody understood why do we have to turn on Oprah at 4 o'clock to find out what's going on in our own city? And if you want to save the schools for the benefit of our children, why weren't we told? And, by the way, there's a very large consensus on the ground in Newark at this time that the schools really need change, that the schools are failing in unacceptable ways. And so there wasn't really, you know, a roadmap for how to do that, but there were a lot of people, including some very skilled, experienced teachers, who deeply understood the needs of the children in Newark who would have been eager to be part of that conversation. And not only were they insulted that they were left out, there was an agenda that was crafted that didn't have the benefit of their really important insights into what was needed in Newark.\\n\\nGROSS: So Cory Booker takes the Zuckerberg money and creates a local foundation to handle the Zuckerberg gift and the matching donations. It's called Foundation for Newark's Future. But you're right that the seats on this foundation went only to donors who gave $10 million or more. That was later reduced to $5 million or more, which meant that virtually no one from Newark could afford to serve on this foundation that was trying to change the Newark schools. How did that play in the community?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, that was again totally alienating of the community because there were a number of local foundations in Newark that had been involved for years in education. And, you know, $5 million as an annual gift just was not in their budget. And so they were excluded from having any say, but more importantly, there was no way for the parents, the teachers, the principals, the community leaders - just, you know, really, really intelligence, smart, committed people who had been in the fray for years in the lives of children in education - to be part of this. And so basically, the board decided to spend the money the way the wealthy donors wanted it spent. And the priorities were not about getting money to the classroom or to the children. The priorities were to have to this kind of business model, top-down reform that had become very popular in the reform movement.\\n\\nGROSS: One of the criticisms of how the money was handled was that $20 million went to consultants, and a lot of the consultants were paid, like, a thousand dollars a day. And you compare that to what teachers make in a year, and that what was their response to that?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, that was another case of, like, you know, this enormous gap between the people who have come to save the Newark children and the people who actually cared for and taught the Newark children. And it became a huge flashpoint because Mark Zuckerberg had indicated that he wanted to give teachers enormous bonuses if they were the top teachers in the district. And that wasn't possible because the district just didn't have the money to pay those bonuses beyond the time that they would have the Zuckerberg money. So there were some merit bonuses put into the contract, but they were relatively small. And the new contract that came out of this reform effort also required teachers in quite a few schools to work longer hours, longer years and to work some weekends for a pretty small stipend that was added to their annual pay. It was $3,000, which they calculated came to about $10 an hour. And they were just - you know, they felt they had been kind of conscripted into working these extra hours and extra days while the people who were in the district, you know, scripting these plans as consultants were getting a thousand dollars a day. And it really became something that turned the teachers - even teachers who wanted - very much wanted change - it turned them against the reform effort.\\n\\nGROSS: If you're just joining us my guest is journalist Dale Russakoff, a former Washington Post reporter who's written a new book called The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? And it's about the attempts to reform the schools in Newark, N.J.\\n\\nSo let's talk about what the plan actually was for reform - the plan that was put into effect by the then-superintendent of schools. And this plan was called One Newark. You want to give us an overview of what the plan was?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes. Cami Anderson, the superintendent, saw this plan as a way to expand charter schools and stabilize the school district at the same time. This is one of the great challenges of, you know, urban districts where charter schools are expanding rapidly - is, you know, that when children leave the school district and go to charters, the money goes with them, and the school district ends up under tremendous stress. The other huge thing that she did in this was that she created something called universal enrollment.\\n\\nNewark, throughout all time, had been a city where kids walked to school. There were many small neighborhood schools, and there was no bus system that took kids to school, except in the case of kids with special needs who had to go to special schools. But the average child in Newark just walked to a neighborhood school. And the feeling that she had - and this is a strong feeling in the reform movement - is that children and families should have choice. They should be able to choose to leave a failing neighborhood school if they want to.\\n\\nAnd so from One Newark onward, which started in the fall of 2013, no family automatically was sending a child to a neighborhood school. They had to go online and pick one of 60-something schools in the city - some charter, some district - and then algorithm would sort whether they got into that school. In theory, it's a great idea because everybody wants to be able to choose the right school for their kid, but it was a huge upheaval in the way people had always lived in Newark. And at the same time, she was closing, consolidating and rearranging the district schools to make way for the charter school growth and to basically downsize the district, which already had lost a lot of kids to charter schools.\\n\\nAnd it turned into a massive upheaval in just the way school was experienced by children and families in Newark. And it was done, again, without a process of vetting with the community to see, well, how if, you know - will this new system work for these children and families? When a school is closed, children had to walk through very dangerous territory, you know, sometimes through gang territory, through drug dealing neighborhoods. And none of that was kind of vetted in advance to see what can we do for these kids to make sure they're safe?\\n\\nGROSS: Something else that didn't work out as planned - Mark Zuckerberg was hoping to use his hundred million dollars to, in part, negotiate different contracts with teachers to have more flexibility in who got hired and who got fired and who got placed in what school. And then he found out something he didn't know initially, which was the seniority thing was controlled by New Jersey law.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes.\\n\\nGROSS: And not by anything you could negotiate with the school district.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes. He put up - half his money, he said, he wanted to go to reforming teachers' contracts to create this new flexibility and to be able to reward the best teachers and eliminate the worst teachers. But he had - I guess Cory Booker never made clear to him that seniority protections for the most senior teachers - the way it work is that when there's a downsizing or a layoff, the most senior teachers are protected, and those who have the least seniority go first, regardless of whether the senior teachers are better than the junior teachers who are being left off.\\n\\nAnd so those were provisions of state law - the state tenure law in New Jersey. That was something that could be controlled by contract. And so the process of trying to get rid of the seniority protections, which was one of his number one priorities, had to go through the New Jersey legislature. And the legislature in New Jersey is controlled by the teachers' union. The New Jersey Education Association's by far the biggest contributor to members of the legislature.\\n\\nGROSS: Right. OK. So Zuckerberg had no idea what he was getting himself into in terms of that aspect of his - of his goal. So...\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes. I want to point out, though, that Chris Cerf, who was the - at the time, the state commissioner of education, did negotiate with the legislature a new tenure law that won a lot of new accountability measures from the teachers' union. And the one thing that the teachers' union insisted on was that they would make all these compromises, but they had to leave the seniority protections absolutely intact. And so that was the compromise that Christie made. And so the seniority protections became automatically a part of this new contract in Newark, which was supposed to be, you know, in the words that the reformers were using, a transformational contract that would become a model for how to reform school districts all across the country, and it was not.\\n\\nGROSS: So how far did the Newark model get in terms of shutting down failing schools, consolidating schools, starting new charter schools?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, I think that the most visible thing they did was that they doubled the number of children going to charter schools in Newark in just a short period of time. Twenty percent of kids were in charters at the time this effort started, and within a year or two, 40 percent of children will be in charters. And in Newark, that's an improvement for kids because the charter schools in Newark dramatically outperform the district schools, even though statewide, that's not true of charter schools, and nationally, it's not. But Newark has, you know, a very superior group of charter schools that are doing, you know, a lot of good work with kids.\\n\\nGROSS: So were the charter schools public schools?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes, yes, these were public schools. And they're just - they're charter schools, so they're not part of the school district. They're independent.\\n\\nGROSS: So from what you observed, why is it that the charter schools in Newark perform better than the public schools?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, I think a key reason is that the charter schools get a lot of more money to the classroom and to the school building than the district schools do. District schools, although they get $19,000 to $20,000 per pupil in public funds to spend, get fewer than $10,000 to the district schools for the principals and teachers to spend on educating the kids.\\n\\nThe charter schools, while starting out with less money, get more of it to the classroom. So they get, like, $12,000 to $13,000 per student. And what they do with that money is really critical because they actually use the resources to support kids who would otherwise have a lot of trouble learning because of the issues that growing up in poverty cause for them. So, you know, there are children who literally - and it's not unusual. Children suffer trauma in Newark from having grown up amid violence, family strife and constant instability in their homes.\\n\\nAnd so when you go into these charter schools - the one that I spent a lot of time in was a KIPP elementary school called SPARK Academy. There were two certified teachers in every grade from kindergarten through third. There was also a learning specialist or a tutor for every grade so that children who couldn't learn in the small groups that these two teachers set up for those who were academically behind or just struggling - there would be a learning specialist who would push in and do extra work with them.\\n\\nThe charter school had three social workers for 520 kids, and they actually had - the school had their time organized so they did therapy. At this particular school, 70 children had therapy every week for different kinds of emotional issues that were interfering with their learning. In the district school, there's one social worker for over 600 kids. And they don't have time to do any therapy because they're just juggling so much, and they have tons of paperwork they're responsible for.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that, the charter school had created a position called the dean of student and family engagement, whose job it was to work with children whose issues outside the classroom were making it virtually impossible for them to learn effectively. So this particular dean would find someone in each child's family to be responsible for their learning. If it wasn't a parent or a grandparent, it would be a neighbor. One time, there was a stepfather who had just come out of prison and wanted to have a relationship with his stepson, and they engaged him to be the sort of chief learning officer for that child. And all of these people were there to be present and to support kids who otherwise wouldn't have been able to learn.\\n\\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Dale Russakoff, a former Washington Post reporter who's written a new book called The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? And it's about the attempts to reform the schools in Newark, N. J. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk about how this plan worked out. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is former Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, who's written a new book, The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? And it's the plan that was put into effect by then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who donated a hundred million dollars to help reform Newark's schools. And that was supposed to be matched by a hundred million dollars from other sources.\\n\\nWhy is it that the charter schools are able to get more money directly to the students and teachers than the district schools are?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: I think it's almost like the difference between FedEx and the post office. The district schools have a lot of legacy costs, and some of those are just extra jobs and incredibly sweet, fat contracts that, you know, people who were friends of politicians over the years have gotten. And there needs to be some kind of - almost a forensic accounting of where the money in the central office of the school district is going so that more of it gets to the classroom. And I think that charter schools are just an illustration of what that money could be doing if it were spent differently. The problem is, of course, that, you know, you run up into, you know, union protections and civil service protections and political organizations that have a real stake in keeping things the way they are. So it probably sounds naive to say that that needs to happen, but if it doesn't happen, I don't see what the future of school districts is in cities like Newark.\\n\\nGROSS: So the education reform movement that we've been discussing in Newark was initiated by then-Mayor Cory Booker who brought in Governor Chris Christie. And then Booker enlisted Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, to donate a hundred million dollars. And then the two politicians kind of moved on to other things. Cory Booker becomes a senator. And you say he hasn't really spoken about the Newark reform initiative since becoming a senator. I don't know if that's changed since you completed the book.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: No, he hasn't.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. Governor Chris Christie got kind of sidetracked by the bridge scandal and then by his campaign for the presidency. So what does that say about politicians' involvement in education reform?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, it basically shows you that politicians do have their own agendas, and educational reform may be one of them, but other things can supersede. And I think it shows why this really has to be a process that is rooted in the community and has its strong advocates who aren't going anywhere, who are going to stay there and believe in it, year after year, and work for it. It's not something that's going to happen in five years or in, you know - within the term of a mayor or a governor. It's something that's going to take generations and has to be worked at continually.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you talk to Mark Zuckerberg about what his takeaway was his first big investment in a philanthropic cause?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: You know, he didn't want to say anything critical about what happened. He said that he feels that he learned that change comes more slowly in school districts than he thought it did. He found that charters are a much faster way to change the situation on the ground for children and that districts are slower and take a lot more work and a lot more politics.\\n\\nBut what's interesting is that he initially had thought that, you know - this is what Cory Booker had told him and what he banked on - was that in five years, they would have a model for how to turn around a failing school district, how - as Booker said, how to flip a city and take it from very, very poor schools and poor performance of children to what he called a model of educational excellence.\\n\\nAnd then Mark Zuckerberg's intent was to go to more and more cities with this model and use his philanthropy to basically solve the urban education crisis. He's not trying to do that anymore, and he's not looking for far away cities with kind of star quality politicians leading them. He's already committed another $120 million, but he's committed it to schools and school districts around the Bay Area, where he is located, so that he and his staff can know the communities where they're going to be working and, as he said, know the desires of the communities and listen to the parents and the teachers and the educators and the community leaders to understand the complex needs of children. So it's a very, very different and much more humble approach to trying to change education.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Dale Russakoff, author of The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? After a short break, we'll talk about the growing education industrial complex. Then David Bianculli will review last night's Emmy Award telecast and look ahead to the fall TV season, and Kevin Whitehead will review the new complete edition of Erroll Garner's 1955 Concert By The Sea. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with journalist Dale Russakoff, author of The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? It's about the five-year experiment to reform the schools in Newark, N.J., a city beset by poverty and violence. The experiment was initiated by then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who enlisted the support of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the project, which was to be matched by 100 million from other donors. There's, like, a whole new network of, you know, funders, foundations, philanthropic groups and education consultants who are leaders of one part of the education reform movement. You actually use the word education industrial complex to describe some of them. Now, I'd like you to talk a little bit about - as you describe it - education industrial complex.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, you know, interestingly, there's always been an education industrial complex. The education industry is over $600 billion a year in terms of the amount of money that is spent by all the school districts in the country on private contracts and consultants and textbooks and testing. And, you know, it's just - it's a huge, huge business. But what - what I've found interesting about the education reform movement is that they also have their own education industrial complex. So when somebody who's very friendly to the education reform movement becomes a leader of a school district or when a governor, like Gov. Christie, who's friendly to the education reform movement, is running school districts in the state of New Jersey, all of these consultants just suddenly appear. And they're available to do work on, you know, how to help them develop the best, you know, and most reform-oriented teacher evaluation system, the most reform-oriented teacher and principal contracts, the best data system because the data has to be incredibly cleaned in order to use the data to judge everyone in the system and hold them accountable. And so there's all of these consulting firms and businesses, a lot of them founded or staffed by people who started off, say, in Teach For America, who worked for some of the more famous reform-oriented superintendents and chancellors like Joel Klein, Michelle Rhee. In fact, one of the leaders of this organization called BRICK, which was kind of the bottom-up group of district teachers who were trying to reform schools just by improving the teaching force - he said that he got so many queries from this group of people that he started calling them the school failure industry, which was, you know, just people who showed up when you had failing schools that were the target of, you know, the education reformers or some of the federal grants that were available for failing schools. There was money in failing schools. And he said there was a school failure industry that was trying to compete for it.\\n\\nGROSS: So I'm sure you've been following this, but Laurene Powell Jobs, who was Steve Jobs' widow, is funding a lot of education reform right now. And what she's trying to do is a kind of crowdsourced education reform. So she's asking teams to submit ideas to her, and then she and a team of judges will pick the best education reform ideas and finance those ideas in the public schools. What do you know about that effort?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: You know, I don't know about it in detail. But it sounds like the kind of thing that might be very exciting in the business world to figure out the next big thing. I don't know that, you know, those kinds of ideas are going to actually transcend into real changes in education because there seems to be a sense that everybody knows as much about how to fix schools as teachers do and as educators do. And a lot of these ideas sound to those of us in the layman's world, like, gee, that's fascinating. That's what's wrong. But if you're really close to the ground and you're inside a school, you know that it's not like there is one thing wrong when a school is failing. There's usually, like, 50 to 100, maybe 500 things wrong. And you have to fix all of them, and it's really tedious work. It's not like a big idea and a new thing. It's something that you have to just do slowly and patiently and often tediously.\\n\\nGROSS: So with the main part of this experiment ended just in terms of the funding of it, how did the charter schools measure up to the district schools in terms of performance?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Well, the Newark charter schools dramatically outperformed the district schools, unlike charter schools across the country, which are more on a par with the district schools and in some cases not as good. The Newark charter schools do much better for kids, and that is one of the things that they're very proud of that they feel they've done for children in Newark.\\n\\nGROSS: And do you think that that's largely because their charter schools have more resources?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: I think that's a big reason. I mean, the charter schools also do not have as needy a population as the school district, but they still have a very, you know, high percentage of kids with - who get free and reduced-price lunch. And they have more kids now who have special needs, so they are serving a broader population than they used to, although still not the same need level as the district schools.\\n\\nGROSS: I'm just wondering this whole accountability movement of, like, testing and collecting data and analyzing data and holding teachers accountable, is that adding a whole new layer of expensive bureaucracy?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes, it has. I mean, they spent millions - literally millions of dollars on a human resources consulting firm to, you know, get a new teachers evaluation system and teach everybody in the district - you know, principals, department heads, senior teachers - how to use it and how to use it to hold teachers accountable. And the state, which - and, you know, this was an initiative that came straight from the federal government. The Race to the Top that President Obama and Arne Duncan, the education secretary, put in place encouraged states to change their laws so the teacher evaluations were based increasingly on the student test scores - how students - whether students grew or not on their annual tests would determine whether teachers were rated effective or ineffective. And interestingly, I spent some time interviewing the measurement scientist who developed the system in New Jersey for measuring whether students grew or not from year to year on their standardized tests. And the state is using that measure of growth to say whether a teacher is effective or ineffective to some degree. And this measurement scientist said that the system was never intended to judge teachers. It was only intended to measure whether children are growing or not because it doesn't tell you why they're growing or who caused them to grow or why they're failing and who caused them to fail. All it tells you is whether they are progressing or regressing. And the teacher is a factor in that, but there are so many other factors that he said, you know, this is just not the way this data should have been used.\\n\\nGROSS: That's especially interesting coming from the guy who created the system...\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes, and he...\\n\\nGROSS: ...To collect the data ...\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: ...And his system\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes, and his system is being used in 35 states, I think.\\n\\nGROSS: Being used to evaluate teachers, right?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Yes. Yes, it's the growth measurement, how - you know, it measures whether students have grown from year to year on their standardized tests. And this is now the data that's being used to evaluate teachers in more than half the states.\\n\\nGROSS: I'm wondering what your takeaway is from the Newark education reform attempts in terms of what seems to work and what doesn't. What are some of the lessons learned as far as you're concerned?\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: You know, the main thing that I am struck by was just by witnessing what this particular charter school was able to do with the extra resources that came into the building and the classroom. The principal of the charter school, who is very proud of their student results because they - you know, they do far outperform the school district - said unequivocally she never would have these results if she didn't have these extra resources. In other words, if she only had the resources to work with that the school district schools had, she couldn't have done this, and her students couldn't have done this. So to me, the biggest takeaway - and again, as I said, it's a huge political enterprise that can't be done easily - but it's to figure out how to get resources to individual schools within school districts to meet the needs of children because they really don't have the resources to meet them now in cities like Newark.\\n\\nGROSS: So listen, Cory Booker really made himself available to you. You spent a lot of time talking to him. You spent a lot of time in his SUV driving around Newark back when he was mayor and was one of the people - people pushing through this education reform plan in the Newark schools that we've been discussing. Do you think he's sorry that he talked to you? Because you've pointed out so many things that didn't work out right, you know, so much conflict that ended up as a result of this plan. He left while it was being implemented 'cause he was elected to the Senate.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: I - I'm sure that he wishes that he hadn't made himself as available. But I don't think it would've really changed. In fact, I think that the book's helped. And he's helped by, you know, seeing the passion and the - the ability that he has to bring national attention to issues, often issues that other people aren't focusing on, like, you know, inner-city schools and currently, you know, the issue of mass incarceration. I think that what he has an incredible talent for is that - is framing issues and getting the nation to pay attention to them or at least getting a wide audience of people to pay attention to them and to pay attention to him in the process. But what he wasn't strong on was in the patient, tedious, kind of unglamorous work of taking those promises and hammering them out into a different reality. He tended to have - you know, to be ready to go on to the next thing.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, Dale Russakoff, thank you so much for talking with us.\\n\\nRUSSAKOFF: Thanks so much for having me.\\n\\nGROSS: Dale Russakoff is the author of The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools?

He had a photographic memory and, like some other kids in our family, knew all the presidents and vice presidents in order. But it wasn't his mind that marked him as so extraordinary. It was his heart. The stories of his love and compassion are absolutely astounding.\\n\\nJamie Raskin, a Democrat from Takoma Park, represents Maryland's 8th Congressional District in Congress.\\n\\nTributes to Tommy have poured in over the past few days.\\n\\nA neighbor wrote to the Raskin family about a time when Tommy organized a group dinner in high school so a classmate of his who didn't have a date to the prom wasn't left out. The classmate never forgot it.\\n\\nWe've been hearing stories like this ever since it happened, Raskin tells Weekend Edition. I mean, Tommy, he felt all of the pain and the suffering in the world, which is how, of course, he found his way quickly to vegetarianism. Nobody in our family was a vegetarian, and now everybody is.\\n\\nTommy wrote at length about philosophy and animal rights; he thought about how human lives should be measured against those of animals and animal suffering. He wrote poetry. Speaking at DC VegFest in 2017, he recited his lengthy poem Where War Begins.

So Tommy had a special relationship with them. He would take Benadryl or whatever to be around them. And he would pet them sort of by gently touching the very top of their heads.

Out of all of the group of interns, somehow he was the one who took responsibility for making sure everyone was doing OK, that no one felt left out, that everyone was connected.\\n\\nJamie Raskin says, You couldn't be in his presence and say a negative thing about people. He didn't mind gossip if it was good gossip. [But] if it was nasty, Tommy would say, 'Excuse me, but it's hard to be a human.' And then that would be the end of that.\\n\\nIn his 20s, Tommy faced serious depression, his parents write in a remembrance. It was a kind of relentless torture in the brain for him that became overwhelming and unyielding and unbearable.\\n\\nDepression affects hundreds of millions of people around the world and is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. It increases the risk of suicide. Most people who die by suicide have had a mood disorder such as depression.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the problem. A study published in September found that the percentage of people experiencing symptoms of depression was three times the percentage compared with before the pandemic.\\n\\nThe Raskin family has now created the Tommy Raskin Memorial Fund for People and Animals. And hundreds of people are sharing good deeds they've done in his name, as The Washington Post reported.\\n\\nJamie Raskin received a standing ovation when he spoke during debate Wednesday over the Republican effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's electoral win. He says he was heartened by words of support from fellow lawmakers of both parties on the same day, Jan. 6, he had to evacuate the chamber because of a violent mob takeover.\\n\\nThat has been a solace and a comfort to me, that at this time of the ugliest possible division, where we've got a violent, seditious mob invading the Capitol, that there is still enough decency and humanity that we can share each other's pain in this situation, Raskin tells Weekend Edition.\\n\\nGoing forward, Raskin says, his family will keep Tommy very close to our heart. And we will fight for every single thing he asked us to. He says Tommy knew that the things that we say are our values and principles ... only have meaning if we act as if they're true, if we make them real. And so we can't let them be empty rhetoric.\\n\\nSamantha Balaban and Kitty Eisele produced and edited the audio interview."}
{"original": "Yes, All This Happened. Trump's First 2 Weeks As President\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. If the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. If you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that as well.\\n\\nHere's a quick recap of the highlights — and lowlights — of the first 14 days of Trump's nascent presidency.\\n\\nSaturday, Jan. 21\\n\\nOn his first full day as president, Trump went to the CIA to try to mend fences with the intelligence agency he repeatedly maligned during the campaign and the transition. (He blamed the media for creating the feud, but his own tweets disprove that.) While standing before a memorial at the agency, he argued over the crowd size at his inauguration, making false assertions that run counter to aerial photos of the event and NPR's own reporters on the ground. He also claimed it stopped raining during his inaugural address, when it did not.\\n\\nHours later, new press secretary Sean Spicer made his first appearance in the White House briefing room to double down on those falsehoods about crowd size. He cited wrong numbers for Metro usage in D.C. and also falsely said that floor coverings used for the first time on the National Mall made photos show where there were gaps, when in fact such coverings had been used before. After delivering his fiery broadside, Spicer left without taking any questions.\\n\\nWhile all that was happening, the Women's March on Washington protesting Trump and his policies toward women drew thousands and thousands of people — and the second-highest Metro ridership day ever, second only to President Obama's first inauguration. Protests weren't just limited to D.C., though — similar events happened across the country that also drew massive crowds. And the protests even went worldwide, happening on all seven continents.\\n\\nSunday, Jan. 22\\n\\nThe White House should have been in cleanup mode after Saturday's first rocky day in office, but instead on the Sunday shows spokespersons doubled down on false claims about crowd size and more. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway argued on NBC's Meet the Press that Spicer had simply provided alternative facts when making his arguments — a moniker that looks primed to persist throughout the Trump administration.\\n\\nMonday, Jan. 23\\n\\nThe biggest news happened when Trump met that evening with both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders, reviving his unfounded claims that there were between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes cast in the 2016 election that caused him to lose the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton. This would continue to be an issue for the rest of the week (more on this below).\\n\\nTrump also signed an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy, a global gag rule prohibiting international nongovernmental organizations that provide or talk about abortion services from receiving federal funding. He also signaled his intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and instituted a federal hiring freeze except for the military.\\n\\nSpicer had his second outing with the press, still in a largely defensive crouch. He blamed the press for trying to undercut the tremendous support for Trump and doubled down on his insistence that Trump's was the most-watched inauguration ever, though given difficulty in counting streaming numbers, that's hard to back up.\\n\\nEthics experts filed a lawsuit in court alleging that the president was in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because of his overseas businesses\\n\\nTuesday, Jan. 24\\n\\nSpicer repeated Trump's unfounded assertions that there was widespread voter fraud during the U.S. elections but provided no further proof of why the president believed that.\\n\\nTrump approved construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which had both been stopped during the Obama administration amid outcry from environmental groups. Other executive orders directed the Commerce Department to review how federal regulations might be impeding U.S. manufacturers.\\n\\nWednesday, Jan. 25\\n\\nTrump signed two executive orders keeping one of his top campaign promises, ordering the U.S. government to begin construction of a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. He asserted that while the U.S. government would have to front the money, Mexico would pay it back. (Mexican leaders have said they will not.) Trump also directed the Homeland Security and Justice departments to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.\\n\\nIn his first interview as president, Trump doubled down (tripled down?) on his unproven belief that there were millions of illegal voters. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion, he told ABC's David Muir.\\n\\nStudies Trump cited offer no proof of such voter fraud. And he also incorrectly claimed it was illegal to be registered in two states; it's not illegal unless someone votes in two states, because often voter rolls are not quickly updated. In fact, it turned out some Trump aides and family members were registered in multiple states.\\n\\nThursday, Jan. 26\\n\\nTrump traveled to Philadelphia to address the GOP congressional retreat, where he delivered a relatively on-message speech promising Obamacare repeal and to crack down on violent crime, and touting his executive actions on immigration and trade.\\n\\nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned trip to the U.S. amid Trump's continued assertion that his country would repay the U.S. for the border wall. One possibility to recoup the investment from Mexico that the White House floated was a 20 percent import tax, which, as NPR's Scott Horsley reported, would effectively saddle U.S. consumers with a significant portion of the wall's cost, estimated at $15 billion or more.\\n\\nTrump gave his second interview, to a friendly source, Fox News' Sean Hannity. He again boasted of his crowd sizes during his inauguration and talked about the (still unproven) allegations that there were millions of illegal votes cast in November.\\n\\nHe also told Hannity he continues to believe waterboarding works and talked about bringing it back, though it is outlawed in the U.S. as torture. His new defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, has said he does not believe waterboarding is effective and has reiterated it is illegal, as have top GOP congressional leaders such as Speaker Paul Ryan.\\n\\nFriday, Jan. 27\\n\\nTrump signed an executive order blocking travelers from seven countries, all of which are Muslim-majority — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia — from entering the U.S. for 90 days. New refugee admissions are suspended for 120 days, while Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. There was confusion at airports whether or not the ban includes those with valid U.S. visas, green cards or people from those countries who are permanent residents. Protests began at airports as travelers were detained.\\n\\nTrump hosted his first foreign leader at the White House — British Prime Minister Theresa May. She pushed for a future trade deal with the U.S. The two held a joint news conference, where May said Trump had reaffirmed his support for NATO — though he has questioned whether the U.S. should be in the alliance in the past.\\n\\nThe annual anti-abortion event called by its proponents the March for Life drew thousands more demonstrators to the National Mall. Vice President Pence and Conway both spoke.\\n\\nSaturday, Jan. 28\\n\\nProtests continued at airports across the country amid confusion over Trump's travel ban. Immigration attorneys began offering their services pro bono. Late on Saturday, a federal judge issued a stay on the deportations of valid visa holders after they have landed in the U.S. in response to an ACLU lawsuit.\\n\\nTrump reshuffled the National Security Council, elevating controversial chief strategist Steve Bannon to be a permanent member of the Principals Committee, giving him equal billing with other Cabinet-level officials. The director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are typically permanent members, will now only attend when pertinent issues are being discussed.\\n\\nTrump called several foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also had a tense call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, though details would not be reported until later in the week. The president told Turnbull it was the worst call by far that he (Trump) had had that day, and the two clashed on the Obama administration's deal to accept refugees from the country.\\n\\nTrump signed several executive orders — an ethics order banning administration appointees from ever lobbying foreign governments and from federal lobbying for five years after they leave office. He also directed the administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS.\\n\\nSunday, Jan. 29\\n\\nA U.S. Navy SEAL was killed during a raid in Yemen targeting al-Qaida militants, the first military casualty of Trump's administration. Later in the week, questions were raised over how the operation — which also is believed to have killed several civilians — was carried out.\\n\\nProtests continued at airports over the Trump administration's travel ban.\\n\\nMonday, Jan. 30\\n\\nActing Attorney General Sally Yates (a holdover from the Obama administration) announced she would direct Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump's travel ban. Hours later, the president fired her, naming Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban Virginia, as the interim attorney general until nominee Jeff Sessions is confirmed by the Senate.\\n\\nMore Republicans continued to speak out against Trump's travel ban, voicing concern over its implementation. Former President Barack Obama broke his silence since leaving office, saying through a spokesman that American values are at stake.\\n\\nTrump signed an executive order that says for every regulation the executive branch proposes, two others must be repealed.\\n\\nTuesday, Jan. 31\\n\\nTrump nominated federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The evening ceremony in the White House's East Room was arranged for suspense, which gave it the aura of a reality TV show in some ways. Conservatives praised his pick, which was a major campaign issue after Senate Republicans refused to take up former President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, for much of 2016.\\n\\nWednesday, Feb. 1\\n\\nNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn made a surprise appearance at the daily press briefing to announce that the Trump administration was putting Iran on notice after the country conducted a ballistic missile test.\\n\\nTrump and daughter Ivanka traveled to Dover Air Force Base for the return to the U.S. of the remains of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who was killed over the weekend in the Yemen raid.\\n\\nThe AP reported that during a call with Mexican President Nieto last week, Trump threatened to send in the U.S. military to stop the bad hombres down there. Mexico denied the remarks.\\n\\nThursday, Feb. 2\\n\\nCelebrity Apprentice creator Mark Burnett introduced Trump at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. During his remarks, Trump called out the low ratings of the NBC reality show he once hosted and criticized the new host, action star and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, OK, the president said.\\n\\nTrump also pledged at the breakfast to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt groups, including religious ones, from wading into politics.\\n\\nFriday, Feb. 3\\n\\nA federal judge in Seattle temporarily halted Trump's executive order on immigration and travel from some Muslim-majority countries. The order is effective nationwide.\\n\\nNew sanctions were announced against Iran, following up on the administration's earlier threat against the country.\\n\\nTrump signed two executive orders directing the review of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations and halting implementation of another federal rule that mandates financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients.\\n\\nSaturday, Feb. 4\\n\\nAirlines resumed allowing travelers once affected by Trump's travel ban to come to the U.S.\\n\\nTrump, who was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., for the weekend, tweeted, The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! Because of the terrible decision, he later added on Twitter, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country."}
{"original": "'I'm Not Electing A Pastor In Chief' — How Iowa's Evangelicals Are Deciding\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nTed Cruz has one of the most overtly religious stump speeches on the Iowa campaign trail.\\n\\nIn Emmetsburg, Iowa, Friday the Texas senator quoted the Bible and exhorted his supporters to pray each and every day until Election Day.\\n\\nHe's real, said Bobbie Clark, a Cruz supporter from Algona. There's something there. There's substance behind it. It's not just talk.\\n\\nThere's a big reason Cruz and others are making that kind of pitch here days before the first votes cast in this presidential campaign season — Iowa's evangelical voters have carved a well-worn path for past Iowa winners. Rick Santorum in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008, for example, won them over and won the caucuses.\\n\\nAs with the fractured 2012 field, it's not at all clear who will win this year's Iowa GOP caucuses. But it seems to be a two-man race — between Cruz and Donald Trump.\\n\\nIn the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll before the caucuses, Trump leads Cruz 28 to 23 percent overall. But Cruz leads with evangelicals, 33 to 19 percent.\\n\\nThat could bode well for Cruz Monday night, if those evangelical voters turn out in high numbers like in year's past. But while Cruz is ahead with those voters, he doesn't have the kind of dominant lead with the group that can ensure victory.\\n\\nJ. Ann Selzer, the pollster who conducted the poll, said Trump's lead shrinks to 1 point over Cruz if religious conservatives match 2012's turnout of 55 percent of the electorate.\\n\\nIn that sense, this year's race is looking more like 2012 than 2008. In 2012, Iowa evangelicals' support was relatively divided. Entrance polls showed Santorum with 32 percent of evangelicals' support, compared with Ron Paul's 18 percent (remarkably close to the Cruz-Trump split that this latest poll shows). Three other candidates each took 14 percent. Santorum went on to win the caucuses by just 34 votes over Mitt Romney. Paul finished a strong third.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in 2008, Huckabee had a far more commanding lead with these voters. He took 46 percent to Romney's 19 percent — and they made up 60 percent of the electorate. All that added up to a solid 9-point win for Huckabee over Romney.\\n\\nWhile all of the Republican candidates are Christians, some, like Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have made their faith a more central part of their message than others. At the Cruz event in Emmetsburg, his supporters said they appreciate his faithcentric campaign.\\n\\nBut while faith plays a part in how many voters choose a candidate, some say they feel manipulated by blunt appeals to their Christian identity.\\n\\nI think sometimes they're just giving me lip service, said Dave Mouw before a Jeb Bush campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa. They're telling me what I want to hear. You can usually tell by a guy if he means it or not.\\n\\nAs of Friday, Mouw was torn between a few candidates — Bush, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Mouw said, there's one candidate who is not winning him over.\\n\\nI don't need Donald Trump reading me a Bible verse, Mouw said.\\n\\nOther voters echoed that ambivalence toward religious appeals.\\n\\nI don't give support simply by quoting the Bible. I want to see it lived out in the policy, said John Lee, a pastor in Sioux Center. I'm not electing a pastor in chief. I'm electing a commander in chief.\\n\\nLee doesn't know whom he will vote for in Monday's caucus, but he knows whom he won't be supporting: Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Lee said his Christian beliefs led him to oppose their hard-line immigration stances — policies that are part of what he labels callous conservatism.\\n\\nSioux Center, where Lee and Mouw came out to see Bush speak on Friday, is in the heart of Iowa's conservative Christian northwest corner, which helped push to victory Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum in 2012.\\n\\nFor context on just how conservative Sioux County is — in the 2012 general election, around 47 percent of Iowans voted for Romney, but nearly 84 percent of Sioux County did.\\n\\nThough Lee acknowledges he is not intimately familiar with his congregation's political views, he said his unofficial sense is that they are divided among several candidates, especially Rubio, Santorum, Carson and Cruz. Meanwhile, of the 600 to 700 people who attend on Sundays, he knows of only one who supports Trump.\\n\\nSo while candidates may make religious references and show off their family Bibles to win over Iowa's Christian vote, that approach can go only so far. Many evangelical voters simply aren't first and foremost religious voters.\\n\\nNancy Van Roekel from Hinton said her faith definitely plays into her decision to support Bush but that his main appeal comes from his consistency and experience.\\n\\nIndeed a big (huge, even) part of Trump's appeal stems from his outsider status, with his promises to drastically change Washington. In fact, many white, self-described evangelicals support Trump despite also not seeing him as very religious, as NPR's Tom Gjelten reported.\\n\\nTrump's message has driven him to the top of the Iowa polls, and some are predicting it could push droves of first-time caucusgoers out the door on Monday night.\\n\\nLee is one such person. He has never caucused before — caucusing requires choosing a party, and as he put it, I don't think God belongs to either party. But Trump has inspired him — albeit not in the way Trump might hope.\\n\\nThis year I will [caucus], Lee said, adding, With Trump leading in the polls, I feel like it's a status confessionis time, Lee said, using a term referring to a point when the church has to take a position on an issue.\\n\\nI have to, as a pastor, say, 'This is not who we are.' Otherwise I sit them out."}

Talk To The Cloud!\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barcroft Media/Getty Images Barcroft Media/Getty Images\\n\\nWater stagnating at a construction site. A dwindling number of mangroves along the shore. Lakes choked with algae and hyacinth. Sewage pipes leaking into the sea.\\n\\nThese are common sights in India.\\n\\nUntil recently, the best people could do to try to draw attention to such problems was to tweet pictures to the government or write letters to the newspaper — hoping someone with the power to make changes would take note.\\n\\nIncreasingly, scientists and activists are enabling citizen observers to collect data and upload it to the cloud with the aim of pushing all stakeholders — government agencies, corporations and citizens — toward change. One of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is free, drinkable water for all by 2030.\\n\\nThese initiatives are very important for empowering citizens, making more data available — and this helps in strengthening accountability, says Binayak Das, program coordinator of the Water Integrity Network, an NGO in Germany.\\n\\nIn her fieldwork across India over the last few years, activist Latha Sankarnarayan says she's often seen scarcity or quality [of water] as a core issue.\\n\\nOften official data is spotty, inaccurate or simply fudged, she says. In Tamil Nadu, for example, people living in [a certain] area claimed that for the past two to three years there was no rainfall. Official rainfall data showed that rainfall was normal for those years and yet the farming lands were fallow and dry.\\n\\nAdditionally, says Umrbek Allakulov, Research and Development Officer at Water Integrity Network, government agencies and research centers in developing countries may not have the ability to monitor and test water quality. Under such circumstances, citizen-led water quality monitoring can offer a supporting hand to help ensure that water is safe for human consumption.\\n\\nSo Sankarnarayan launched an app called Climatix to measure climate resilience by crowdsourcing.\\n\\nTechnology like this is enabling scientists to gather frequent and reliable data from the grassroots level — and to fill in gaps. And proponents of citizen observations say having more hands on deck helps advance not only science but also policy.\\n\\nIf I train 200 citizen scientists, I'll be able to have a much more valid, scientifically robust reason for why something needs to be changed, says Steven Loiselle, head of the FreshWater Watch program at the nonprofit EarthWatch Institute. Freshwater Watch has active projects in Delhi's Yamuna river and Hyderabad's lakes.\\n\\nAnd people supporting citizen data gathering say they have seen outside data lead to change.\\n\\nClaire Grandadam, also from Water Integrity Network, says it happened in Costa Rica three years ago. With the data and citizen pressure, the water board set up water meters to check supply and billing, she says.\\n\\nThe measurements were used as evidence to advocate policy change, she says. We've seen that when decision-makers are faced with concrete data, they can be pushed to take action.\\n\\nChange and accountability are, of course, the Holy Grail. Elsewhere, in Costa Rica, citizens measured the levels of herbicides and pesticides in their drinking water. While these groups are still awaiting recourse, documentation has helped them take their fight to the courts.\\n\\nThe Flint water crisis is [another] case in point, adds Allakulov,  where independent and citizen-led water testing raised the alarm about the lead-contaminated water, which eventually exposed neglect, unethical behavior and potential corruption on the part of several public officials.\\n\\nSometimes governments initiate citizen drives themselves, like in California, where IBM worked with the state to make a water mapping app called Creekwatch.\\n\\nIn India, though, crowdsourcing apps are not yet hugely popular. But they are gaining steam. In cities like Mumbai, where monsoon rains are torrential every year, there several pothole-logging apps. In Bangalore, the Jackboy app can measure air pollution.\\n\\nBut the app advocates note that there needs to be education about the issues before an app will find an audience.\\n\\nSankarnarayan, for example, is leading interested parties on a walk through the rivers and wetlands of Mumbai to create awareness and highlight their connection to the near constant flooding of the city. She hopes it'll encourage citizens to log data about air, water and soil in the Climatix app.\\n\\nAnybody can send in their observations or report on things like water-logging [where water saturates the soil] in a specific area, which may lead to flooding if there's a sudden cloudburst or extreme climatic event — water scarcity, salinity increase or drought, Sankarnarayan says.\\n\\nSometimes, needed information goes beyond simple observations on water levels or color; it can require doing a quick lab test on the go.\\n\\nAkvo (Esperanto for 'water') is a nonprofit foundation that provides software and services for disadvantaged populations, with a focus on water management.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tom Baas Tom Baas\\n\\nConducting a breakout session during World Water Week in Stockholm last year, Akvo's Bjelkeman-Pettersson demonstrated the mobile-phone-enabled water-quality tests that their lab in Bengaluru uses. One kit contains a simple strip test, say for pH or phosphates. Another consists of a collection jar and a reactant chemical that can test for fluoride — a big problem in India and Bangladesh. There, too much fluoride in the drinking water has led to mass fluorosis, a condition that leads to calcification of ligaments.\\n\\nThis [fluoride] test on a mobile phone is of equivalent quality as an ion selector device used in the lab; the difference is this cheaper and portable, Bjelkeman-Pettersson says. The data is calibrated, interpreted and sent to the cloud with time stamps and GPS markers. The test can be extended to check chlorine, bacteria levels in the water, and, soon, arsenic — another big problem in the Indian subcontinent.\\n\\nSaikiran Gaddam, an engineering student in Hyderabad, was one of 11 Akvo volunteers who spent 10 days last year in the field — in the rural Nalgonda district about 60 miles from the city — testing 240 wells, streams, ponds and water filtration plants. Armed with gloves and a small kit the size of four decks of cards, they did basic tests for five hours a day out in the hot sun. The Akvo app on their mobile phones let them log, map, and upload data on contamination and chemical run off.\\n\\nWe came to know ground realities, Gaddam says. We saw the pipeline connections, how water is getting polluted, we saw how the villagers live and what they have to face.\\n\\nThe drinking water options in this part of India are limited. Local water sources may be toxic because of runoff from industries, for example. If water is delivered from a filtration plant, it could lack minerals.\\n\\nBut the local administration and police department of Nalgonda were responsive: The water authorities promised to monitor the filtration plant and close off contaminated wells.\\n\\nWe fill a vacuum, says Gaddam. With our help, citizens can hold the government accountable.\\n\\nHe admits there are limitations. Citizen observatories are not labs, though their trainers work to put checks, balances and cross-references to keep the data as reliable as possible — and to keep the people safe.\\n\\nThere also are some concerns about putting the data in the cloud.\\n\\nWhen data is collected in India, it is not only about water and sanitation but also demographics, says Das of Water Integrity Network. The information can also be used to see if a lower caste doesn't have the same access to water and sanitation as high castes do.\\n\\nAnd many studies show that minority communities don't have access, says Das of Water Integrity Network.\\n\\nIt's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says Allakulov. Walking the last mile and extending safe drinking water to those at the base of the pyramid may be just the avenue that will benefit greatly from citizen-led water quality monitoring\\n\\nSankarnarayan with the Climatix app remains hopeful. Her mantra: What we can measure, we can manage.\\n\\nChhavi Sachdev is a freelance reporter in India. You can reach her @chhavi.

{"original": "Out Of Bounds: New Research On Race And Paying College Athletes\\n\\nA new study shows race is a factor in the debate over whether to pay college athletes. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to UMass Amherst political scientist Tatishe Nteta, who co-authored the study.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nWith college basketball in its March frenzy, a new angle on the old question of whether NCAA players should get paid.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: For the championship - yes.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We prevent these gifted kids from being able to earn any money.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You don't deserve the revenue.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I see my name being used to profit somebody else.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: A new study suggests opinion on this debate could be shaped by racial prejudice. In today's edition of Out Of Bounds, we talk to the study's co-author Tatishe Nteta. He was driving to his job one day at the University of Massachusetts Amherst when he heard a radio commentator slam the idea of paying college athletes. He heard hints of racial bias. Being a social scientist, Nteta wanted to test his hunch. He devised a survey that weighed variables like age, sex and interest in college sports and negative attitudes towards African-Americans, a measure he calls racial resentment. Then Nteta crunched the numbers.\\n\\nTATISHE NTETA: We found that race was the strongest explanation of white opposition to pay for play.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Was it surprising that race came into this debate?\\n\\nNTETA: That was surprising. We actually - I didn't think we would find what we found in terms of the impact of race. But also shocking was the impact of attendance at a Power Five school. So we found, amongst our respondents who attended these Power Five schools, which are just simply schools from conferences that have high-powered college football and college basketball teams, that attendance at this school actually leads to stronger opposition to pay for play.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So can you just break it down for us? When you say that there's racial resentment...\\n\\nNTETA: Yeah.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Over these issues, what does that mean? Is that something that they're conscious of or not? I mean, what can you extrapolate from that?\\n\\nNTETA: Racial resentment is a new way to measure what is negative attitudes or negative affect towards African-Americans. And it's based not on the notion that blacks are biologically inferior but that they violate cherished values, values like hard work and meritocracy and respect for authority. So there are a number of different ways of measuring this.\\n\\nso it's more subtle, this animus towards African-Americans, but it's animus nonetheless. So they'll ask questions like the Irish and the Italians and Jews faced discrimination but worked their way up to success. African-Americans should do the same. And you agree, or you disagree? And so agreeing with that sentiment would be an indication of racial resentment.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And in this scenario, to do with this particular issue, the idea's that somehow they don't feel that African-Americans are deserving of the money...\\n\\nNTETA: Yeah.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...And that they won't, I guess, use it in the correct way?\\n\\nNTETA: If we really want to drill down - and to be fair, we don't have the specific answer to your question with our data - but if you really want to drill down, I think that's what's going on here is that there's a long history in political science of whites, when faced with policies in which African-Americans are the beneficiaries or African-Americans are the targets, their negative views of African-Americans tend to be a good measure of understanding their opposition to these particular policies.\\n\\nSo for instance, something like welfare reform - welfare reform is ostensibly not a racial policy. However, when you think about the individuals who are most likely to be on welfare, the picture that comes to your head is of usually an African-American and usually of an African-American woman. And so study after study have found that negative attitudes towards African-Americans affect your attitudes regarding welfare reform.\\n\\nSo we believe that pay for play is very similar. If you just look at the percentage of African-American men in college basketball and college football, they far outdistance any other group. The picture in your head when you come to think about pay for play in terms of who will benefit if there's a change to the policy are going to be young African-American men. So for some whites, this is a subliminal connection. They're not aware. It's implicit. And for others, it's more explicit.

{"original": "Big Jump Seen In Number Of Inmates Prescribed Psychiatric Drugs In California\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption erwin rachbauer/imageBROKER RM/Getty Images erwin rachbauer/imageBROKER RM/Getty Images\\n\\nWhen 47-year-old Edward Vega arrived in jail, he couldn't quiet the voices in his head. He felt paranoid, as though he was losing control. I knew if I didn't get my medication, I was going to hurt someone, says Vega.\\n\\nHe was right. A week after being arrested for alleged drug possession, Vega says, he assaulted a fellow inmate and ended up in isolation, which only made him feel worse.\\n\\nFinally, a doctor prescribed drugs that Vega says helped. He had been taking them on the outside but ran out just before he was arrested.\\n\\nThe medication hasn't totally taken away the voices, but I am able to differentiate reality from fiction, says Vega, who was released three months ago.\\n\\nThe number of inmates in California who've been prescribed psychiatric drugs has jumped about 25 percent in five years, according to a recent analysis of state data. These inmates now account for about a fifth of the county jail population across the state.\\n\\nThe increase might be a reflection of the growing number of inmates with mental illness, though it also might stem from improved identification of people in need of treatment, say researchers from California Health Policy Strategies, a Sacramento-based consulting firm.\\n\\nAmid a severe shortage of psychiatric beds and community-based treatment throughout the state and nation, jails have become repositories for people in the throes of acute mental health crises.\\n\\nThe number of people with mental illness in jails and prisons in the U.S. is astronomical, says Michael Romano, director of Three Strikes & Justice Advocacy Project at Stanford Law School, who was not involved in the research. In many ways, the whole justice system is overwhelmed with mental illness.\\n\\nContributing to the problem in California is a 2011 federal court order, and a state decision a few years later, that had unintended consequences.\\n\\nIn 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered California to reduce the prison population because of overcrowding that the judges said constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Three years later, a state proposition reclassified some felony crimes as misdemeanors. Taken together, that led to a huge influx of offenders going to county jails instead of state prisons.\\n\\nThe CHPS analysis, based on survey data from 45 of California's 58 counties, opens a window into how the most-populated state is coping with the influx.\\n\\nWe think this is the first part of a more systematic discussion about what is going on in the jails and in the broader community with respect to mental health, says David Panush, a co-author of the report, which was funded in part by the California Health Care Foundation.\\n\\nFar more people with mental illness are housed in jails and prisons than in psychiatric hospitals. Insufficient staff training and poor patient treatment have contributed to inmate suicides, self-mutilation, violence and other problems, say advocates for the mentally ill.\\n\\nOne oft-cited complaint is that inmates have poor access to psychiatric prescriptions to treat such conditions as schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder.\\n\\nJail officials in California say they are trying to better identify incarcerated people who could benefit from such drugs. The numbers suggest the strategy may be working. According to the CHPS report, an average of 13,776 inmates in the 45 California counties were on psychotropic medications in 2016-2017, up from 10,999 five years ago.\\n\\nBut the portion of inmates taking psychotropic medicine varies widely by county — from 8 percent in Glenn County to 32 percent in Sonoma and Napa, according to the analysis. The report is based on data from the Board of State and Community Corrections, an independent state agency.\\n\\nIn Los Angeles County, where the jails have been described as one of the largest mental institution in the country, about 30 percent of the roughly 18,000 inmates are mentally ill and most of those diagnosed are on medication, says Dr. Joseph Ortego, chief psychiatrist for correctional health services in L.A. County.\\n\\nAlthough some are still missed in the screening process, he says, the county jails have improved identification and treatment of inmates and expanded staffing as part of a 2015 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The department had alleged inadequate mental health care and suicide prevention in the jails.\\n\\nOverall, medications are likely underprescribed in jails, psychiatrists say.\\n\\nYou need enough mental health professionals to treat the very large numbers of mentally ill people in jails, says Dr. H. Richard Lamb, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Southern California School of Medicine. There probably aren't enough.\\n\\nAnd the medications these doctors prescribe are a crucial aspect of treatment, Lamb says.\\n\\nSome advocates for the mentally ill worry that the drugs are at times prescribed inappropriately. Zima Creason, president and chief executive officer of Mental Health America of California, says psychoactive medicines, though sometimes necessary, are no substitute for comprehensive care for jail inmates.\\n\\nSadly, they just throw a bunch of pills at them because there is nothing else, she says, adding that jails should also be providing individual and group therapy, more time outside of cells and sufficient recreation time.\\n\\nJail is not conducive for real recovery, Creason says. We are never going to put a dent in the numbers unless we provide a therapeutic environment.\\n\\nLike people who live outside the correction facilities, inmates can be subject to involuntary drug treatment, officials say, but only if a court deems that step appropriate.\\n\\nCounty jail officials, including Dr. Alfred Joshua, chief medical officer for the Sheriff's Department in San Diego County, say the influx of mentally ill inmates and the rising need for psychotropic drugs stems from a lack of resources for patients in the community.\\n\\nWhen they have [an] exacerbation of mental illness, they do many times come into contact with law enforcement, Joshua says.\\n\\nSome of the most common charges that bring people with mental illness to jail are drug offenses and parole violations. Those who are homeless frequently get charged with panhandling, public urination and related crimes.\\n\\nIn addition to trying to improve treatment inside the jails, officials in Los Angeles and San Diego counties say they are working more closely with community organizations to ensure inmates with mental illness get the services they need after their release.\\n\\nVega says a local community group, the Neighborhood House Association, was able to help in his case, ensuring he got his meds and other treatment.\\n\\nWithout the medication, Vega says, I would probably be right back in jail.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

{"original": "Balancing Justice, Public Safety: Virus Brings Changes To Courts, Jails, Arrests\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ross D. Franklin/AP Ross D. Franklin/AP\\n\\nWhat to do with a jury summons during a pandemic? That was the question Edward Lifson faced when he opened his mail and read that he was scheduled for jury duty in Los Angeles this week. Lifson believes it's an honor and a duty to serve on a jury, but, to be honest, I would not do it right now, he says. If they told me I had to come in I would say no.\\n\\nNo worries for Lifson and other potential jurors, though. On Monday, California's chief judge put all Superior Court civil and criminal trials on hold for at least two months. Mike Buenger with the National Center for State Courts says in many states, courts are operating under emergency operation plans. Trials already underway will continue, but there's no schedule for new ones. Buenger says there will still be some in-person court action. For example, people still need temporary restraining orders or civil protection orders for domestic violence, he says. We still have children who are in at-risk environments and so there may be need for child protective orders.\\n\\nIn Chicago, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says on any given day, there are typically hundreds of cases in one of the country's biggest court systems with dozens of jury trials. Foxx says Cook County's chief judge ordered an unprecedented slow-down which suspends most criminal and civil cases until the middle of next month. The primary focus in her office now, she says, is on cases where people already in custody may want to plea bargain.\\n\\nOur number one concern is recognizing that people who are at Cook County jail are at a heightened risk for the virus because of their close containment, Foxx says.\\n\\nOnce coronavirus gets into a jail, there's no way to stop it from spreading. You cannot do social distancing in a jail. You cannot.\\n\\nSo there's been a scramble in states to release non-violent detainees. Nina Ginsberg, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers says it's a critical step that needs to occur. This is ground zero, she says. Once coronavirus gets into a jail, there's no way to stop it from spreading. You cannot do social distancing in a jail. You cannot.\\n\\nThis week, New Jersey took an unprecedented step. It started releasing all individuals in the state's county jails who've been convicted of low-level crimes or are serving time for probation violations. Others who are still awaiting trial will not be released. ACLU-NJ attorney Alexander Shalom says the ACLU, public defenders, prosecutors and the state Attorney General's office negotiated an agreement because there is an urgent need to reduce the jail population to help contain any spread of the coronavirus. He says it will mean freedom for about 1,000 individuals.\\n\\nIt's not a get out of jail free card, in a sense. It doesn't commute people's sentences, says Shalom. What it does, is it says: We are going to let you out now in this time of crisis. Shalom says once the crisis is over, it's either back to jail for a detainee who was released or a sentence could be commuted.\\n\\nThe department is not turning a blind eye to crime. No one will escape accountability for the crimes they commit.\\n\\nPolice departments across the country are doing their part by holding back arrests. Last week in Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said the department will continue to make arrests for non-violent crime but once a person's identity is confirmed, they will be released. The department is not turning a blind eye to crime, says Outlaw. No one will escape accountability for the crimes they commit. Outlaw says police will also hand out warrants telling the individuals they are letting go that they must come in later.\\n\\nIn Los Angeles, Craig Lally, the head of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, says instead of arrests for non-violent misdemeanors like shoplifting, officers are writing release from custody citations. It's almost like a ticket — like a speeding ticket, Lally explains. When you sign for the ticket, you're not admitting guilt, you're just signing that you'll go to court. Lally says the arrest policy helps keep people potentially infected with coronavirus out of police stations and jails. Los Angeles Police continue to arrest anyone who commits a serious crime.\\n\\nDuffie Stone, the head of the National District Attorneys Association says with all the changes taking place, officials in the criminal justice system should be careful so there's no trading of one risk for another. I don't want to see us release a bunch of criminals out of jails, whether on plea deals or bail reductions, because we are trying to fight a pandemic, says Stone.\\n\\nWhatever the perspectives, the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing the criminal justice system to find new ways to balance justice with public safety."}
{"original": "The 'Racial Caste System' At The U.S. Capitol\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bill Clark/Getty Images Bill Clark/Getty Images\\n\\nAfter the Capitol was cleared of insurrectionists on Jan. 6, there was work to be done. You may have seen the video of a group of Capitol workers cleaning up the great halls, trying to restore order and dignity to rooms that had been trashed and defaced.\\n\\nJames R. Jones, an assistant professor of African American studies at Rutgers University, was watching as the mob rioted through the Capitol's great rooms and hallways. After the tear gas cleared, he knew what was likely coming next: It wasn't lost on me that it was going to be Black workers who had to clean up after their mess.\\n\\ntoggle caption Rhonisha Franklin\\n\\nJones was an intern at the Capitol during his undergraduate years at George Washington University, and was struck with how racially bifurcated it was back then. Whites work for whites, Black staffers work for Black lawmakers, Latino staffers work for Latino members, and so on, he says. And he says there is a largely overlooked community, almost exclusively people of color, who make sure the Capitol complex runs smoothly.\\n\\nThere's a whole army, Jones points out, workers who are mostly Black and Brown, who really are the custodians of Congress. They are making sure this vast physical complex is up and running for lawmakers, staff and visitors.\\n\\nJones writes about the Capitol's segregation in his forthcoming book, The Last Plantation: Racism in the Halls of Congress, which will be published later this year by Princeton University Press. I talked to him about the book's provocative title, the people who work behind-the-scenes, and some of the things Congress could do to balance out its racial inequities. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nIf I were to walk through the Capitol Hill complex and randomly pop into various Senate or House offices, what would I see? Do these places look like America?\\n\\nWell, you'd see that it's majority white. And part of that is Congress's own fault. Congress does not collect demographic data on who it employs. So it becomes really hard to see and measure racial representation among senior staffers. I've been part of an effort to collect empirical demographic data on congressional staffers, whether they're senior staffers or interns. What we've been able to see is that a lot of the staffers of color are employed by members of Congress who themselves are people of color.\\n\\nIt matters who's in the room when policy decisions are being made because those decisions will affect everyone. Staffers are instrumental in helping lawmakers think through complicated issues, issues that will confront communities of color. So whether you're talking about policing or climate change or even economic policy, it matters who's in the room and it matters what perspectives are being heard and listened to as policy is being made.\\n\\nYou've titled your forthcoming book The Last Plantation. Where did that phrase come from?\\n\\nThe idea of Congress as the last plantation developed in the 1970s. Lawmakers, staffers and journalists began calling Congress the last plantation to draw attention to how Congress was exempt from federal workplace laws — laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial and gender discrimination in the workplace. This is a law that remade the country's racial landscape in a really dramatic way, in many ways, catapulting Black men and women into workplaces previously dominated by white men.\\n\\nDid anyone speak out against this do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do practice back then, or did they all just look away?\\n\\nThere were a few lawmakers who spoke out and understood that this was a problem. One was Senator John Glenn (D-OH). He was famous before he arrived to Congress; he was an astronaut. He was the first lawmaker to go on record calling Congress the last plantation in a Senate hearing in 1978 that aimed to apply federal workplace laws to Congress.\\n\\nI can imagine some of his peers were pretty offended. How did that go over with them?\\n\\nNot well! He later mentioned that some of his colleagues did not speak to him for several months after he said that.\\n\\nBut in many ways Glenn was right: Service workers on the Hill received a different set of benefits than the more visible members of Congress. Sometimes unionization gives workers assurances of some protections, like a minimum wage, health care, some kind of pension, due process in the event of a disagreement with a supervisor. Are the current non-legislative Hill workers part of a union? If they are, does that help?\\n\\nThat's a complicated question. Some congressional workers are allowed to unionize and some aren't. Those who are directly employed by Congress cannot unionize. Congress, again, has exempted itself from federal workplace laws that allow American workers to unionize. But there are certain workers who are not employed by Congress who are allowed to unionize, like cafeteria workers. This is a group that fought really hard in the 1970s and 1980s for the right to unionize. They had to use the last plantation as a metaphor to draw attention to how there was a racial caste system on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nSo in the cafeteria workers' case, they embarrassed Congress into doing the right thing?\\n\\nAgain, it's complicated. Members of Congress allowed them to unionize in the 1980s—but because of that, they couldn't be federal employees anymore. So they became private employees of these third-party contractors who took over the dining services in Congress. As a result, they gained the right to unionize, but they lost their government health and other benefits. Notably as you mentioned, their federal pension.\\n\\nOn January 20, we'll have a new president, and a number of new people in Congress and in the Senate. What would you ask them to consider, in terms of changing the demographics on Capitol Hill, as they start their terms?\\n\\nI would ask them to be transparent about their hiring practices so both the Congress and the White House publish and collect demographic data about who they employ. What we know from other work settings is that these data are important for measuring the presence of discrimination. Without these data, we can't really hold members of Congress or even the president accountable for who they hire—it becomes really complicated to do so in the absence of this data.\\n\\nThe second thing I'd ask is to make sure that the way in which they're going about hiring and promotion is fair. Often it's through social networks, and it's these social networks that in many ways facilitate the hiring of white staffers; it's just, you know, this insider's game. So in many ways, we need to push back and have much more transparent and fair hiring and promotion processes, and make sure that people from different backgrounds are able to work in government."}
{"original": "Coronavirus FAQ: Do Airplane Passengers Not Know There's A Pandemic Going On?\\n\\nEnlarge this image Malaka Gharib/NPR Malaka Gharib/NPR\\n\\nEach week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: Weekly Coronavirus Questions.\\n\\nWhen I booked a flight from Boston to Washington, D.C., in mid-January, I knew that sharing confined indoor spaces with strangers was a risk in the middle of a pandemic. But a year into living with the coronavirus, I figured it wasn't a huge risk.\\n\\nMy reasoning:\\n\\n1) It's a short flight.\\n\\n2) Everyone knows how to wear a mask and social distance by now.\\n\\n3) Surely airlines have adopted measures to help reduce chances of transmission if a traveler is infected but doesn't yet know it.\\n\\nI was so naive.\\n\\nMy 11:15 a.m. flight was delayed to 12:39 p.m. Then to 1:32 p.m. Then it was canceled and rebooked for 4 p.m. And delayed to 4:45 p.m. Then we all got on the plane — and got off again, when the plane's electronic system broke on the runway.\\n\\nSo I had many hours to observe my fellow passengers. They streamed by with masks on — but often hanging below their noses, nostrils fully exposed. One man took off his mask to cough. Dozens of people clumped at the gate, many less than 6 feet apart — the recommended spacing to minimize risks of transmission. The plane was packed with passengers. And people were quite literally in each other's faces when we boarded and deplaned.\\n\\nWhen I shared my experience with a colleague, she said, and I quote: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkk!\\n\\nI was left with many questions. Freelance contributor Sheila Mulrooney Eldred and I went searching for answers.\\n\\nPien Huang\\n\\nIs it really up to a passenger whether to wear a mask (properly or at all)?\\n\\nIn some countries, there is federal guidance. In India, for example, the government declared in May that all flyers must wear masks ... and even gloves. (Gloves aren't necessarily protective. Read this.)\\n\\nIn the United States, there is no federal law that requires masking in public spaces. But states do. And U.S. airports follow state public health guidelines in most spaces. So you may hear repeated loudspeaker announcements reminding you of the state mandate to mask up.\\n\\nOnce at a ticket counter or gate, you'll be under the jurisdiction of that airline's rules – and the same applies on board the plane. In the U.S., all major airlines require masks for passengers ages 2 and up and may specify what types of masks are acceptable (those with vents are a no-no).\\n\\nBut what happens if a traveler's mask is below the nose while wandering the terminal?\\n\\nAt some airports, such as Denver International Airport, passengers may get a reminder from airport staff — or an offer of a free disposable mask. But not every airport encourages its employees to address the situation. So should you call out a traveler whose mask has slipped below his nose? Only if you can do so gently and without provoking that person — best not to prompt a screaming match, which will certainly increase aerosolization, says Abraar Karan, a Harvard Medical School physician. Instead, avoid food courts and people eating or drinking in the gate area. Take advantage of empty gates to hang out in before the gate agent calls you to board.\\n\\nAnd consider upgrading your own mask before you fly, perhaps to the type of mask classified as KN95 and certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Whenever you're in a situation where not everyone is wearing a face covering properly, you'd feel a lot more comfortable if you had a really good mask on, Karan says.\\n\\nIs there any way to make sure passengers don't crowd each other at airports?\\n\\nOn Sunday, Pien Huang saw airline staff admonish a man because he was standing in the entryway to the tunnel connecting the gate to the plane, and holding up the line — but the same staffers made no efforts to get people to stand 6 feet apart in that line.\\n\\nThe reality is, you can have masking and distancing rules, but whether or not people follow them and whether they're easily enforceable is a very different thing, says Dr. Henry Wu, director of Emory TravelWell Center and an associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. The aircraft environment itself can be a contentious, high-stress situation; crews have always had a tough time dealing with passengers who don't want to follow their policies.\\n\\nTo some degree, airline and airport staff should play a role in enforcing such rules, Wu says. But while he's strongly in favor of public health policies, a more effective path to adherence is encouraging people to mask and distance so compliance is pretty much baked into our brains – like wearing a seat belt, he says.\\n\\nThe more habitual and common people make it the more people will have peer pressure to do it. We're clearly not there yet, Wu says.\\n\\nUntil then, protect yourself at the airport by staying away from crowds until it's time to board, Karan says. Eat beforehand so you're not tempted to hit the food court (and don't have to take your mask off for an in-flight refueling).\\n\\nMinimize the number of airports you'll enter by booking a direct flight if possible.\\n\\nIf you can spring for TSA PreCheck, you'll cut down on the time spent in line for the security check.\\n\\nAnd we said it before, but we'll say it again: Find an empty gate area to wait in until your boarding call.\\n\\nWhatever happened to the policy of no middle seats?\\n\\nGood question!\\n\\nEarlier in the pandemic, many airlines were not booking middle seats to create more distance between passengers. The only major U.S. airline to keep up this practice is Delta Air Lines, which has pledged not to book middle seats through March.\\n\\nWhile it's easy to understand why many airlines have given up that policy — bottom lines! — it's not great news for passengers.\\n\\nIf you have someone right next to you without a mask on or coughing or sneezing or a mask that's poorly fitting, the bets are off, Karan says.\\n\\nA study of a September flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to New Zealand shows how much proximity matters: At least four people within two rows of a contagious passenger were infected with the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, you can't count on airlines or public health departments to notify passengers if someone on your flight is subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.\\n\\nIt is really important, but it gets complicated on a flight, says Karan, pointing out how quickly people disperse. You can still do it, but it takes a lot of resources, and we're at a point in the epidemic where transmission is so high.\\n\\nSome airlines in other countries have implemented policies and precautions aimed at reducing risk, such as China Airlines' guidance for people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth during the flight.\\n\\nShould I take any comfort in the new policy of testing passengers flying into the U.S.?\\n\\nThis week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that every passenger flying into the U.S. would be required to present a negative test for the coronavirus, taken within the last three days, before boarding.\\n\\nBut passengers who test negative before their flight may turn out to have the disease once they get to their destination, because it usually takes a few days after infection for tests to catch the virus.\\n\\nSo how effective will this policy be?\\n\\nI think that it depends, Karan says. It will help in the sense that it'll catch some people who are infectious. Now the question is, how will it be enforced? Policy without enforcement is just words on paper.\\n\\nAnd airlines are responsible for that – they're required to check testing documentation for incoming international passengers before issuing a boarding pass.\\n\\nIt might help, Wu says. [But] on the other hand, in and of itself, it's not a solution. It's just one of many things to help us improve the situation.\\n\\nPostscript: Pien Huang is now living in the post-flight limbo recommended by the CDC for domestic travelers:\\n\\nConsider getting tested with a viral test three to five days after your trip and reduce nonessential activities for a full seven days after travel, even if your test is negative. If you don't get tested, consider reducing nonessential activities for 10 days.\\n\\nIf your test is positive, isolate yourself to protect others from getting infected.\\n\\nAnd she's not planning to take any flights in the near future."}
{"original": "Clinton Stings Trump On Economy: 'We Can't Let Him Bankrupt America'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J.D. Pooley/Getty Images J.D. Pooley/Getty Images\\n\\nHillary Clinton delivered a stinging indictment Tuesday of both Donald Trump's business record and his economic policy prescriptions, an early effort to undermine what the business mogul has billed as one of his chief qualifications for the White House.\\n\\nWe can't let him bankrupt America like we are one of his failed casinos, Clinton told supporters at an alternative high school in Columbus, Ohio. We can't let him roll the dice with our children's futures.\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign also debuted a new website, Art of the Steal, that highlights serious questions about Trump's business record, many of which have been raised in recent news accounts. Both the New York Times and Washington Post have documented how the public company controlling Trump's Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt, shortchanging vendors, investors and lenders while still making lavish payouts to Trump himself.\\n\\nOver the years, he intentionally ran up huge amounts of debt on his companies and then he defaulted, Clinton said Tuesday. Hundreds of people lost their jobs. Shareholders were wiped out. Contractors — many of them small businesses — took heavy losses. Many went bust. But Donald Trump? He came out fine.\\n\\nSeparately, USA Today reports thousands of contractors and employees have sued Trump, accusing the billionaire businessman of failing to pay them what they're owed. The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump's sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years, the paper said. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\\n\\nIn America we don't begrudge people being successful, Clinton said. But we know they shouldn't do it by destroying other people's dreams.\\n\\nTrump told USA Today the complaints represent a small fraction of his suppliers and employees, and he insists he routinely pays what he owes.\\n\\nThe Clinton website calls Trump a below-average successful businessman who got rich by hurting a lot of people. He's Mitt Romney but bad at his job.\\n\\nClinton also took aim at Trump's economic platform, which includes deep tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, increased spending on the military and veterans, and new restrictions on both trade and immigration.\\n\\nClinton argues that Trump's policies would explode the deficit and put the federal government's rock-solid credit at risk.\\n\\nMaybe Donald feels differently because he made a fortune filing bankruptcies and stiffing his creditors, she said. But the United States of America doesn't do business Trump's way.\\n\\nAn independent analysis released this week by Moody's Analytics concludes that if Trump's policies were fully implemented, they would drive the U.S. economy into a lengthy recession, with 3.5 million fewer jobs at the end of his four-year term and a substantially larger federal debt and deficit. The authors acknowledge that Trump's policies would very likely be watered down through the legislative process. But even accounting for such compromise, they warn, The upshot of Mr. Trump's economic policy positions under almost any scenario is that the U.S. economy will be more isolated and diminished. (The lead author of the Moody's report, Mark Zandi, has contributed the maximum $2,700 to the Clinton campaign, which Trump pointed out in a statement.)\\n\\nClinton plans to follow up with another speech on Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C., where she will spell out her own economic platform.\\n\\nNot one to take criticism sitting down, Trump responded live on Twitter during Clinton's speech:\\n\\nHow can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2016\\n\\nHillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as\\n\\nSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2016\\n\\nAnd Trump is expected to fire back again with his own speech in New York City Wednesday. Trump tweeted that he plans to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nTrump has been particularly critical of Clinton's past support for trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which her husband signed, and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Clinton originally backed as secretary of state. She has since come out against the 12-country trade pact, saying it doesn't go far enough to protect American workers.\\n\\nOpposition to trade agreements and immigration has been a cornerstone of Trump's economic platform, leading Moody's to conclude that Mr. Trump's economic proposals will result in a more isolated U.S. economy. The analysts acknowledge that globalization has both positive and negative effects for American workers. On balance, though, Moody's says immigration and trade contribute substantially to U.S. growth. Pulling back from globalization, as Mr. Trump is proposing, will thus diminish the nation's growth prospects.\\n\\nBoth candidates had planned to deliver versions of these speeches a week ago but adjusted their schedules in response to the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Fla.\\n\\nTrump's campaign has struggled in recent days. New campaign finance filings show him trailing far behind Clinton in fundraising, with just $1.3 million in the bank as of June 1, compared with Clinton's $42 million. On Monday, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski."}

Some hospitals lack electricity, and more than 13,000 doctors have left Venezuela in the past four years in search of better opportunities.\\n\\nThey don't give food to the patients in the hospital, Valencia tells Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd.

Even if they find the right medicine, which is often smuggled from Colombia and Brazil and could be expired, most people can't afford it.\\n\\nThe crisis affects Valencia personally, who relies on medication for a kidney transplant.\\n\\nI haven't received my medicine since August last year, he says. Right now, I'm taking medicines that [have] expired, and my transplant is at risk.\\n\\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has refused to accept humanitarian aid, blocking shipments of medicine and first aid supplies. Government data shows infant mortality rose by 30 percent in 2016 and malaria infections shot up 76 percent, Reuters reports.\\n\\nSo most countries when they're hit by a crisis, they're taking aid from other countries, from NGOs, Associated Press reporter Hannah Dreier told NPR in 2016. But Venezuela keeps refusing to take donations that other countries are offering and is actually turning back shipments of donations that people have given in places like the U.S., not letting medicine in.\\n\\nDrug prices have skyrocketed along with those for food and other basic necessities. The International Monetary Fund predicts inflation will soar to 13,000 percent this year and the economy will shrink by 15 percent.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the government announced it would abandon one of its two official foreign exchange rates, which had been used for food and medicine imports, Reuters reports. The policy change could encourage businesses to import more goods, but critics say it won't be very effective due to the lack of hard currency in Venezuela.\\n\\nThe elimination of the exchange rate was a step in the right direction because it helps correct foreign exchange distortion, Asdrubal Oliveros of local consultancy Ecoanalitica told Reuters. But without dollars, things will continue to be more complicated.\\n\\nSince the collapse of Venezuela's oil-rich economy in 2014, the country has struggled to raise hard currency. The monthly minimum wage for many Venezuelans is now equal to $3, according to the AP.\\n\\nMaduro blames the country's growing crisis on foreign economic sanctions, claiming that the U.S. is leading an effort to wipe out socialism in Venezuela, according to Reuters. Presidential elections are set to be held by April 30, which is much earlier than usual, but Venezuela's pro-government Supreme Court last week banned the main opposition party from running."}
{"original": "Trump Administration Gets An Earful On New Campus Sexual Assault Rules\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tovia Smith/NPR Tovia Smith/NPR\\n\\nThe Department of Education has been inundated with approximately 100,000 public comments on its proposed new rules for how campuses handle cases of sexual assault. Secretary Betsy DeVos opened the public comment period two months ago, after unveiling her plan to replace Obama-era rules with regulations that, she says, would better protect the accused. The window for comments closes Wednesday at midnight.\\n\\nMany who have weighed in praise the new rules for restoring sanity and fairness to the process but many more are critical.\\n\\nThose comments range from short expletives and insults aimed at DeVos, to personal and sometimes graphic accounts of sexual assaults,and pleas not to return to the bad ol' days, when victims were not believed and incidents were swept under the rug.\\n\\nThe deluge of comments comes as survivor advocates have been mobilizing their troops on social media, at comment-writing pizza parties, and through crash courses in commenting on college campuses.\\n\\nAt a recent meeting of the Boston University Students For Reproductive Freedom club, Sage Carson with the survivor advocacy group, Know Your IX joined in by video conference, updating students on what the proposals would do.\\n\\nI'll be blunt, she says, It's devastating. She tells the students the proposed rules would mean schools don't automatically have to investigate incidents alleged to have occurred in private, off-campus apartments, or misconduct that is reported to a coach or resident advisor, for example, instead of the official Title IX officer.\\n\\nShe then instructs students how to formally file their objections through the Hands Off IX website. A Mad Libs-type of template makes commenting easy, and then forwards submissions on to the official regulation comment website.\\n\\nStudents first fill in their name, and identify as a survivor or concerned citizen, for example. Then they can pick from a list of rules they take issue with, and then from a list of studies and data that bolster their case. Carson urges the students to make it their own.\\n\\nAs long as you submit something that is personal, and you say why this is important, the department is legally required to respond, she says. It takes about 5-10 minutes ... It's super simple and can have real-world implications.\\n\\nAfter the meeting, sophomore Blaire Thomas launches the website on her phone, checks out the sentence starters and decides to write about the off-campus exclusion.\\n\\nMost of the places that me and my friends spend time on nights and weekends are off campus, she explains. And I feel like this is a direct attack on the protections that students have a right to.\\n\\nIt's incredibly disturbing, says Julia Mullert. I live off campus and the fact that I could be few minutes away and that would change everything, is really devastating. But it also motivates me to push back against it and fight harder.\\n\\nActivists hope the sheer volume of comments will force officials to pay attention.\\n\\nSupport for the regulations\\n\\nThere's no official count of supporters and opponents, but even those who favor the new rules concede they're getting beat.\\n\\nWe know we'll never match the number of comments of victims' advocates, says Cynthia Garrett, co-president of Families Advocating for Campus Equality, a group representing those who say they were wrongly accused. But the Department [of Education] is smart enough to understand that quality is more important than quantity.\\n\\nGarrett has been encouraging comments from accused students who say they were victims of an unfair system, that left them kicked out of school with dashed prospects, ruined reputations, and in many cases, severe depression.\\n\\nWe have a kid who planned to paddle out on a surfboard with a concrete block, says Garrett. We have another one [who was found in his garage] standing on a stool with a rope in his hand. I mean this is very devastating.\\n\\nGarrett says the new rules better protect the wrongly accused, for example, by allowing schools to demand more proof of wrongdoing, by guaranteeing the right to cross-examine accusers, and by narrowing the definition of sexual harassment.\\n\\nWill public comment sway policy?\\n\\nFighting these issues through agency regulations — once the domain of wonky lawyers — is something of a newer frontier in political activism. Harvard Law School Professor Jacob Gersen, an expert in the administrative law process, and a proponent of many of the changes DeVos has proposed, says most regulations still get just a smattering of comments — certainly not a hashtag campaign on social media. But it's increasingly a part of political strategy.\\n\\nParties and activists have gotten good at this over the years, Gersen says. They recognize that the bureaucracy and the administration is actually where the power is and that's a much more effective place to spend your political energy. And they're right about that.\\n\\nJess Davidson, executive director of End Rape on Campus, that's part of the Hands Off IX partnership, agrees. We have really revolutionized the way that people can participate in this process ... and we're making this incredibly powerful democratic tool one in which you can clearly sue the department if they don't listen to you and take your voice seriously.\\n\\nThe regulations.gov website discourages mass-generated submissions, warning that some agencies may choose to 'redact, or withhold' submissions containing duplicate/near duplicate examples of a mass-mail campaign. A tip-sheet further advises that Many ... mistakenly believe that their submitted form letter constitutes a 'vote' but in fact, while public opinion may guide policy, decisions are made on sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes. A single, well-supported comment may carry more weight than a thousand form letters. (NPR reached out to Education officials with additional questions, but did not receive answers before deadline.)\\n\\nDavidson dismisses suggestions of a copy-and-paste campaign. The website template gives people the tools ... to write unique, substantive comments. We're democratizing [the process] and making it more accessible to the people who are disproportionately harmed by [DeVos' proposed] rules.\\n\\nI think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. Women deserve that.\\n\\nSuccess however, is hardly certain. Past efforts for example the one that generated millions of comments on net neutrality, ultimately failed to sway administration officials' minds.\\n\\nMass mailings can also be the victims of their own success, as the overwhelming quantity of comments forces officials to use machines to read them. It's a prospect that infuriates activists, like Stanford Law School Professor Michele Dauber.\\n\\nHow insulting, she says. I think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. Women deserve that.\\n\\nIt's one of the reasons Dauber, who also chairs the Enough is Enough Voter Project PAC, helped distribute tens of thousands of postcards at womens' marches around the nation. She's hoping hand-written notes will force a human read.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Kimberly Kirchmer Courtesy Kimberly Kirchmer\\n\\nIf the department doesn't read — and heed — the comments, Dauber says, a legal challenge will follow.\\n\\nBut Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education says comment quantity should not drive policy.\\n\\nConstitutional rights aren't decided by majority vote, he says. Due process is not subject to the whims of the masses.\\n\\nOfficials may take months to review the comments and respond. They will likely give schools some lead time before enacting the new regulations, and inevitable legal challenges may bring further delays. That means it could be close to the 2020 election before any new regulations take effect. Activists say that may ultimately be how the issue is decided. As Dauber put it, the way to get rid of these regulations, is to get rid of the people who wrote them."}

We are willing to create a vast space for peaceful unification, but we will never leave any room for any sort of Taiwan independence separatist activities, he said speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.\\n\\nXi went on to say independence would only bring profound disaster for Taiwan and ensured the island a bright future under a one-country, two- system framework, according to Reuters.\\n\\nThe Chinese president's urging for the two to come to the table came during a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the Message of Compatriots in Taiwan when, on Jan. 1, 1979, China offered to open up communications and stop military action against the island. As NPR's Shanghai Correspondent Rob Schmitz has reported previously, Taiwan split from China in 1949 when the U.S.-supported Chinese nationalist leadership fled after losing a civil war to communist forces.\\n\\nThen-president of Taiwan Chiang Ching-Kuo turned down Beijing's olive branch in 1979, reports Reuters, and later that year came out with the Three-Noes Policy: no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.\\n\\nDecades later, China has again been rebuffed.\\n\\nIn response to Xi's speech, current president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept Beijing's offered arrangement of one country, two systems, reports Reuters. In her own speech just the day before, Tsai, who is member of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, urged China to respect Taiwan's democratic values.\\n\\nMore than 70 percent of Taiwanese believe Taiwan is already an independent country, according to an analysis done by The Washington Post. Unification with China has also become unpopular, the Post reports only one-third of Taiwanese citizens want to be part of China against — a drop from 60 percent who supported is in 2003.\\n\\nOnly about 20 countries across the globe recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, which means different governments from Latin America to Africa have become drawn into the long-running diplomatic spat over the years. The U.S., which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from China, is no exception. While the State Department says the U.S. enjoys a robust unofficial relationship with Taiwan, right after his inauguration President Donald Trump called Xi and promised that Washington would stick to the One China doctrine. Then just a little over a year later, the U.S. dedicated a new complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has long functioned as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, NPR previously reported.\\n\\nThough he didn't name any country specifically, Xi warned Wednesday against foreign interference in China's Taiwan issue, saying family matters should be resolved by family members, reports the AP."}
{"original": "Medical Bills Still Take A Big Toll, Even With Insurance\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Houge for NPR Jason Houge for NPR\\n\\nFor Barbara Radley, there is before and after. Before was when she could work — moving furniture, and driving a long-haul truck.\\n\\nIt was nothing for me to throw a couch on my back and carry it up a flight of stairs, says the 58-year-old from Oshkosh, Wis.\\n\\nThen there's after. After she herniated five disks in her back. And after, she says, her blood pressure medicine destroyed her pancreas.\\n\\nNow Radley is disabled, suffering from diabetes, liver failure and scleroderma.\\n\\nAnd she is bankrupt.\\n\\nWell, the medical bills were just piling up, Radley tells Shots. We couldn't handle it. We just couldn't keep up.\\n\\nRadley is among the 26 percent of people in a recent poll who say health care expenses have taken a serious toll on family finances. The poll, conducted by NPR, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, shows that even people with medical insurance are still struggling to pay medical bills.\\n\\nRadley and her husband, also a mover, were getting by on his paycheck and her disability payments, which together brought in about $30,000 a year.\\n\\nBut, two years ago, they were hit with a double whammy. His company changed to a health insurance plan that required the couple to pay higher premiums — about $700 a month — higher copays and a $5,000 deductible.\\n\\nThen her husband needed emergency surgery and missed a few months of work.\\n\\nThat just killed us financially, Radley says.\\n\\nThey moved out of their family home and rented a place from her daughter-in-law. They stopped eating out — except once in a while, when they'd get a free meal at their church.\\n\\nStill they ended up in bankruptcy early last year. They were able to write off their old medical debt, but the health problems didn't go away. Barbara's costs are constant and her husband had another surgery last fall. In the past 12 months they've racked up an additional $10,000 in unpaid medical bills.\\n\\nEverybody wants your money and it's like, 'Well, stand in line; you ain't gonna get none,'  Radley says with exasperation.\\n\\nAccording to the poll, Radley has plenty of company. Of the people who said health costs have caused them serious problems, 7 percent ended up in bankruptcy.\\n\\nRadley now makes Faustian bargains on a regular basis.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Houge for NPR Jason Houge for NPR\\n\\nThere are times I check my blood for my insulin and I know I only have two pens left, she says. And I really can't afford it for another week and a half. Well, then I take a lower dose of my insulin. Otherwise I'll just skip it.\\n\\nBut skipping insulin also can be dangerous, Radley knows.\\n\\nIf I would skip it for several days that would put me in the hospital, she says, and that just gives me more bills.\\n\\nOn Monday she was trying to decide whether to take out a payday loan or sell something on Craigslist to cover her insurance plan's $454 copay for two months of insulin.\\n\\nA study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that companies are shifting health care costs to their employees. Workers' share of health insurance premiums for their families rose 83 percent from 2005 to 2015, the survey shows. The amount employees had to pay for deductibles for individual insurance increased 255 percent from 2006 to 2015. The increases are far higher than growth in workers' wages.\\n\\nThat hurts the sickest people the most, says Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in health policy at the Urban Institute. A study by her organization shows health care has become more affordable since the Affordable Care Act was implemented two years ago. Still, the research found, about 17 percent of adults in the U.S. continue to struggle to pay their medical bills.\\n\\nWhen we see higher deductibles, higher copays, higher coinsurance, higher out-of-pocket maximums on these insurance plans, the people who are most affected are those that have the most need for medical care, Blumberg says.\\n\\nAbout 15 percent of those in NPR's poll say that at least once in the past two years, they couldn't get the health care they needed. And 58 percent of those said it was because they couldn't afford it.\\n\\nSeparately, 19 percent of poll respondents say they didn't fill a prescription because of the cost. Mary Lena Warden, 78, of Cleveland, Texas, is among them.\\n\\nWarden lives alone and uses a wheelchair to get to the drugstore around the corner and to her doctor down the road. She pays $147 a month for Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled. That's out of the $1,400 she gets each month in Social Security payments.\\n\\nWarden says she doesn't qualify for extra help, like food stamps or Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor.\\n\\nAll my money is gone by the time I pay my rent, my gas, my lights, my water and my copay for the doctor, Warden says. Everything else is gone.\\n\\nJust two weeks ago, Warden skipped an appointment for an echocardiogram because she couldn't afford the $100 copay. And she is trying to decide whether to fill a prescription for a drug called Neurontin, which dulls the nerve pain in her leg — pain caused by a severe car accident. The last time she picked up the drug, her copay was $159.95.\\n\\nRight now I'm afraid to even buy medicines, Warden says. I can't afford 'em.\\n\\nMedicare, like more and more health plans, leaves lot of expenses for patients to cover, says Drew Altman, CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThe public perception may be that, because Medicare is so popular, it is gold-plated Cadillac coverage, Altman says. But people who are on Medicare know that those costs can really bite.\\n\\nAltman says Obamacare has given nearly everyone in the U.S. access to health care. About 89 percent of people now have insurance in some form, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBut simply having insurance isn't always enough.\\n\\nThe next big challenge, Altman says, is to stop people from going broke when they get sick."}
{"original": "Imran Khan: From Swaggering Cricketer To Populist Prime Minister\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Farooq Naeem/AFP/Getty Images Farooq Naeem/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nWhen he was a swaggering cricketer, and the Pakistani national team was struggling, fans would chant: Who can save Pakistan? It's Imran Khan! It's Imran Khan!\\n\\nAnd the chant has now continued into his rallies, says Omar Waraich, a Pakistani political analyst and former newspaper correspondent.\\n\\nFor his supporters, Khan has come full circle, from the man who led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, to winning Pakistan.\\n\\nOn Friday, Pakistan's election commission said that Khan's party, the Pakistan Movement for Justice, had won the biggest share of seats in the National Assembly, paving the way for Khan to become the country's next prime minister.\\n\\nHe possesses a rare trajectory. A sporting legend who was also a handsome playboy and British celebrity — he married one of Britain's wealthiest socialites — and transformed his public image. He became a philanthropist and took on the mantle of public piety even as he turned to politics.\\n\\nNow he assumes leadership of one of the world's most populous Muslim countries, facing enormous challenges at home and abroad. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed nation that has hostile relations with neighbors Afghanistan and India. It is mired in debt, faces rising temperatures and diminishing water supplies. Meanwhile, militants continue to wreak havoc in the country's periphery.\\n\\nThe world of Pakistani politics\\n\\nFor some analysts, Khan fits a similar mold as other conservative populists who have enjoyed renewed favor in recent years. In Khan's case, that populism is bent toward Islamism. He has vowed to make Pakistan an Islamic welfare state.\\n\\nImran himself says that one of the people he'd like to emulate is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says Waraich, referring to Turkey's president, who has increasingly tightened his grip on power. Even amongst his supporters, there are some who worry he may take that comparison a bit too far.\\n\\nEven before official results were announced, Khan reached out to Pakistanis, promising them to run the country as it has never before been run. He vowed to fight corruption and alleviate poverty. On foreign policy, he has called for peace with India; praised China, Pakistan's closest ally; and criticized the United States, arguing that Pakistan has been waging war on behalf of Washington.\\n\\nAmerica gives aid to Pakistan to fight America's war, he said in a speech broadcast from his home in a wealthy Islamabad suburb Thursday. This causes a lot of damage to Pakistan, he said. We want relations with the U.S. that are mutually beneficial.\\n\\nIt is so far unclear, however, how much control Khan will have over policy toward the U.S., India and Afghanistan, which have long been the purview of the military.\\n\\nKhan's party ended up with 116 of 272 contested seats in the parliament. Despite the extent of his win, his victory has been marred by allegations that the military and judiciary conspired to curb his main rival's electoral success — and to boost him into the premiership. Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's former prime minister and leader of the former ruling party, alleges that a slew of corruption cases against him and his family was timed to destroy their political future.\\n\\nThose cases stem from the release of the Panama Papers in 2016, which detailed how Sharif's children were linked to offshore companies that owned upscale apartments in London.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of those revelations, Khan loudly pushed for the courts to investigate the Sharifs, who offered contradictory explanations for how the apartments were paid. The courts would ultimately oust Sharif as prime minister in 2017. Sharif was also banned from public office, and then, weeks before the election, sentenced to prison for a case surrounding the ownership of the apartments.\\n\\nIn the run up to elections, other leaders from Sharif's party faced criminal charges under anti-terrorism laws. One leader was given a life sentence in a narcotics case. There was also a crackdown on media outlets perceived as sympathetic to Sharif. That prompted a European Union monitoring team to say on Friday that the run-up to Pakistan's elections had reshaped the political environment ahead of the elections.\\n\\nThe State Department said it shares concerns about flaws in the pre-voting electoral process, which included constraints placed on freedoms of expression and association during the campaign period that were at odds with Pakistani authorities' stated goal of a fully fair and transparent election.\\n\\nThe military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history, has denied any interference, as has the judiciary.\\n\\nKhan too, dismissed those allegations, saying that corruption is what brought down his rival. Responding to an NPR question at a press conference earlier this month, he said: How would a Western government react? Would they not put somebody like that behind bars? he said. How can there be any sympathy for somebody like that?\\n\\nFor his critics, it signaled Khan's accommodation with the military, Pakistan's most powerful institution — as long as he could win.\\n\\nNo stranger to the public eye\\n\\nKhan is from a wealthy family who reside in Pakistan's second-largest city, Lahore. He was educated at the University of Oxford, and spent his years crisscrossing between Pakistan and the United Kingdom, where he became a sought-after celebrity for his cricket skills, easy charm and good looks. He even married a wealthy British socialite, Jemima Goldsmith, who converted to Islam and moved to Pakistan with him — they divorced on good terms in 2004 after nine years of marriage.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Holland/AP Steve Holland/AP\\n\\nAround the time he retired from cricket as a hero in the early 1990s, he began fundraising for a cancer hospital and research center, named after his mother. That effort inspired a generation of Pakistanis to rally around a philanthropic cause, according to Mosharraf Zaidi, an Islamabad-based columnist for Pakistan's The News International and co-host of a political affairs podcast called How to Pakistan.\\n\\nI'm part of a generation of Pakistanis who went door to door all around the country to raise money for the Shaukat Khanum Hospital, says Zaidi.\\n\\nKhan created self-awareness and civic sense of duty and responsibility, he says. It was the first time a politician had done something like that in Pakistan.\\n\\nKhan entered politics around the same time, founding his Pakistan Movement for Justice Party in 1996. He protested against Pakistan's military dictatorship at the time. He protested against the crackdown on the press, Waraich says. He protested against enforced disappearances. He was also vehemently against Pakistan's involvement in the war on terror, and advocated for negotiations with the Taliban.\\n\\nSlowly, he built up a following as he lashed out against Pakistan's endemic corruption, and gathered a robust and diverse coalition of people that could win electorally, Zaidi says.\\n\\nBut for years, his party had only ever won one seat — his. Then, in 2013, the party won about 10 percent of the national assembly, according to Zaidi. They became the chief opposition party, attracting socially conservative urban middle class voters.\\n\\nWe want change and we want him to bring change, says Iftikhar Ahmed, 23, a salesman in a sporting goods shop in Islamabad. We have already tested the others, Ahmed says. Imran will improve education, he will stop money laundering, he will bring an end to corruption, he will bring so many reforms.\\n\\nNo stranger to criticism, either\\n\\nBut to Khan's critics, he is a man who craves power, not governance. They cite a damaging sit-in that paralyzed the capital Islamabad during the fall of 2014 after Khan claimed his rivals had rigged the elections to their favor. Meanwhile, as a lawmaker, he was one of the most absent legislators in Pakistan's parliament — only showing up for 4 percent of all days that lawmakers are expected to attend, according to Pakistan's Free and Fair Election Network.\\n\\nThey see him as a disrespectful leader who calls his opponents donkeys — leading some to blame his followers for torturing at least one real-life donkey in a frenzy of hatred, according to local media.\\n\\nThey critique his populist promises, which they say are unrealistic and unattainable. Those promises include a swift end to corruption, a promise to build 5 million affordable homes, create 10 million jobs and revitalize tourism.\\n\\nAmong some Pakistani feminists, Khan is viewed with suspicion for saying that Western feminism degraded motherhood. He was also accused of sexual harassment by a former legislator in his party, Ayesha Gulalai, which Khan wouldn't comment on last year.\\n\\nHis second marriage, to Pakistani broadcast journalist Reham Khan, lasted less than a year, ending in divorce in 2015.\\n\\nNow 65, Khan's party confirmed his third marriage to Bushra Manika earlier this year. He married her in secret. She is called one of his spiritual advisers and she covers her face in public.\\n\\nSome view Khan with suspicion for what they say is his coddling up to militants.\\n\\nThey point to his governing coalition providing millions of dollars-worth of funds for a seminary run by a man who is seen as the spiritual father to the Taliban. He also openly supports Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have been disproportionately used to punish minorities. A radical cleric who founded a militant organization that was close to al-Qaida also announced he was joining Khan's party.\\n\\nZaidi says the presumption that Khan has embraced extremists is incorrect.\\n\\nKhan and his party are very cynical and opportunistic politicians, and so their embrace of right wingers has often been based on cynical calculations, he says. What is I think more dangerous, he says, is the degree of moral agnosticism that he's displayed in his dealings.\\n\\nWaraich offers a different interpretation. Imran Khan is as contradictory as Pakistan itself, he says.\\n\\nImran is not alone in being someone who can appear liberal at one moment but also holds conservative views — be comfortable in the West and also be comfortable in a village here. That's true of many Pakistanis, Wariach says — but particularly Khan.\\n\\nNPR's Abdul Sattar contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Danielle Pletka On Soleimani Strike\\n\\nNPR's Leila Fadel talks with Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute about why she thinks killing a top Iranian general was a shrewd move by the Trump administration.\\n\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\\n\\nWhile there has been much criticism of the move to target Iranian General Soleimani, there are many foreign policy experts that welcome the news. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is one of them, and she joins us now from Australia. Welcome, and thank you for talking with us. I know it's very late there.\\n\\nDANIELLE PLETKA: It is not so much late as early, but yes. Happy to be here. Thanks, Leila.\\n\\nFADEL: Thank you. So two previous U.S. administrations had General Soleimani on their radar and chose not to target him. Why do you think now is the right time?\\n\\nPLETKA: Look; you know, it's not just two previous administrations. It's even more than that. Qassem Soleimani has been a pivotal figure in Iran for decades and instrumental in Iran's regional and global reach for almost as long.\\n\\nI suspect now - because now was the moment of opportunity, now is the time when he has been behaving - if I can say this, you know, with some perspective - most brazenly. He has been parading around Iraq as if it is a province of Iran. He has been directing Iraqi militias as if they belong to Iran. He has been ordering attacks against American targets as if he is the ruler of Iraq, and that's been a big problem.\\n\\nFADEL: Ms. Pletka, though, also, he was - these Iraqi militias that are influenced by Iran are also militias that were fighting ISIS in Iraq, right?\\n\\nPLETKA: Of course. Look; what we're talking about now is what is - what are called the Hashd al-Sha'bi, the popular mobilization unit that rose up in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal in 2011 to fight ISIS, al-Qaida and - what used to be al-Qaida in Iraq. For sure, but the trope that the notion - the trope that the enemy of my enemy is my friend doesn't work here. Just because they were fighting ISIS doesn't mean that, given the opportunity, they wouldn't kill Americans. They have.\\n\\nFADEL: Now many of your colleagues in the foreign policy establishment have raised alarms, saying they think the consequences for the U.S. and the region could be dire. What do people say - what do you say to people that say this makes the U.S. less safe, it will further destabilize the region?\\n\\nPLETKA: That's always going to be the case. Anytime a hard call gets made, there are people who believe that it was the wrong call at the wrong time. And there are lots of arguments to be made that we should just ignore everything that's going on in the region, wait for it to come to the United States. You know, why not? After all, why shouldn't half a million people die in Syria? Why shouldn't hundreds of people die in Iraq? Why is that our business? My view is that these problems need to be dealt with before they become problems in New York, in LA, in Washington. It's a difference of perspective.\\n\\nFADEL: But most people would say that the people who would pay this price would be the people in the region. And many of the - the hundreds of thousands of deaths in Iraq, a lot of that can be put on the U.S. and not Iran, correct?\\n\\nPLETKA: I don't think that the number hundreds of thousands in Iraq is actually a correct one. The place where we can really talk about a half a million people dying is in Syria. And we can thank, among others, Qassem Soleimani for that, not to speak of the many others, including hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. soldiers who died because of him.\\n\\nIt is really hard to underestimate his importance. And while he's not a name that is on everybody's lips in the United States - and I understand that - he is somebody who has been at the forefront of every single bad thing that Iran has done for the past two, three decades.\\n\\nFADEL: In the few seconds we have left, what if the calculation is wrong here? What if - you know, Iran has promised vengeance. What if it doesn't back down?\\n\\nPLETKA: If Iran doesn't back down, then they will put the United States in the position of having to deal with them.

{"original": "Local Governments Race To Administer Coronavirus Tests, Secure Supplies\\n\\nSurging coronavirus infections mean that local officials in the hardest-hit cities are forced to take on new responsibilities that go far beyond their normal day jobs.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nWe are living in historic times. The great pandemic of 2020 has crippled the global economy, shut down life as we knew it and overwhelmed what was always touted as a sophisticated and modern health care system in the United States. The federal government under the Trump administration delayed the rollout of testing due to mismanagement and mistakes. So now it's falling to local governments around the country to test people for the coronavirus and to get enough protective equipment, or PPEs, to hospitals - that means mayors and council members, people who may have never experienced anything like this crisis.\\n\\nNPR's Rebecca Hersher and Leila Fadel have been talking to local officials about what that's like and how it is or isn't working. And they're both with us now.\\n\\nBecky, I'm going to start with you and New York City. It is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., and the CDC has just asked people from the area to avoid traveling for two weeks. How is the local government there handling the enormous task of making sure hospitals can handle all the patients coming in?\\n\\nREBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: It's been really hard, honestly. You know, there's really been extensive spread of the virus in New York City, so much so that the CDC is now urging average citizens who live in New York City, in New Jersey and Connecticut to not travel outside that area for two weeks even if they feel healthy because they may have been exposed.\\n\\nAnd the pandemic - it's putting a lot of pressure on the city government. There's one example that really stands out to me - this doctor named Mary Foote. Her job with the New York City Health Department is to help hospitals prepare for outbreaks of infectious diseases. Like, she has literally spent the last five years only thinking about this topic.\\n\\nAnd yet this pandemic hit New York City so hard, so fast that it brought up issues she has never encountered. Like, she said she really pays attention to other disease outbreaks in recent years. She studied the SARS outbreak back in 2009, 2010. She studied MERS more recently. And here's what she told me.\\n\\nMARY FOOTE: The PPE - I mean, who would've predicted that? You know, I've studied a lot about, you know, the SARS and MERS outbreak and trying to pull out best practices, you know, over the last several years to help people prepare, whereas now, I mean, we're just having to, I mean, go in a whole different direction of thinking and risk mitigation when you're talking about, like, do you always wear a mask? How do you reuse a mask safely without self-contaminating? I mean, this is, like, a whole nother (ph) level.\\n\\nHERSHER: And so even with all her training, she's looking to other experts outside city government, trying to piece together guidance for hospitals that she supports.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So what does that actually mean for hospitals, though? Are we confident they're getting what they need from the local government at this time?\\n\\nHERSHER: It really depends. On one hand, I've talked to clinicians and pathologists who say they are not getting the supplies they need. They need more help than city government - getting things like testing equipment, for example.\\n\\nBut a lot of medical workers have also said that they're constantly in contact with the city health department, the mayor's office, trying to figure out how to handle this unprecedented wave of patients because there are a million questions that come up when you're dealing with a pandemic. And a lot of those questions - they end up on Mary Foote's plate. Like, she said she's having endless calls with ICU directors, with hospital associations, with hospital epidemiologists. She's answering questions like...\\n\\nFOOTE: You know, how you can approach things and resource shortages for your PPE. How do you appropriately clean and disinfect? It's starting to feel like everybody in New York has my phone number now. So yeah, it's a lot.\\n\\nHERSHER: So she and her colleagues - they're basically working 24/7. And you can imagine - if she feels like she's been thrust into the middle of something she's barely prepared for, you can just imagine how it feels for local officials who don't spend all their time, usually, thinking about infectious diseases on a normal day.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, let's bring in NPR's Leila Fadel so we can take a look at Los Angeles.\\n\\nMary Foote in New York has been preparing for this her whole career. But I take it you spoke to a local councilman in LA who's only recently had to become a pandemic expert.\\n\\nLEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Right - well, sort of. I spoke to David Ryu. He represents District 4 of Los Angeles. That's about 275,000 residents in a city of 4 million. And so typically, his job is to represent his district. So he says what he thought he'd maybe be doing in a pandemic like this was figuring out how to protect people from evictions. But this, he says, is what he's actually doing.\\n\\nDAVID RYU: I never thought that I would be negotiating international agreements for lifesaving products, and I never thought that I would be calling on manufacturers to repurpose their production lines.\\n\\nFADEL: So he negotiated a $1.25 million deal with Seegene, a South Korean company, to bring in 20,000 tests to LA County that began Friday so that the city can understand the scope of infections among the millions of people who live here. And he's doing it, he says, because the federal government has failed to come through to provide testing and, really, a national policy on this pandemic.\\n\\nRYU: We are like a nation city. We would loved to work in partnership with all other governmental levels and jurisdictions. But you know, this is a pandemic. Every day that passes, it's growing exponentially. And I can't wait on the federal government to come and fix this. We're going to step up and fix it ourselves.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So let me understand this. He's negotiating deals. Other cities are negotiating deals. Doesn't this just then pit cities and states against each other in the open market?\\n\\nFADEL: Yeah. So this is a huge concern, something that Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York has said, urging the president to use the Defense Production Act to make these supplies, something the president finally said he would do on Friday, but only after waffling on the subject for at least a week. The Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, also dealing with an outbreak, has said that his state just can't compete with more resourced states like New York.\\n\\nAnd here in California, they're turning to wealthy benefactors. They've received donations like ventilators from Tesla's Elon Musk and masks from Apple's Tim Cook - things that smaller cities and states are likely not getting. And the councilman I spoke to, David Ryu, said this.\\n\\nRYU: Every state, every city throughout the nation - we're all fighting for it. So case in point, normally, this kind of coronavirus test - it's roughly about $52 per test. But because of the supply chain bottlenecks, a dollar swab is now $10. The plastic trays where you put the swab in, which might've been at 10 cents, is now going for a dollar. I mean, every part of the supply chain has been hijacked.\\n\\nFADEL: And he says basically, Los Angeles has given up looking to the east to Washington D.C. for help, and they're actually turning west - turning to South Korea in this case.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's extraordinary. That's NPR's Leila Fadel reporting on the situation in Los Angeles.\\n\\nLeila, thank you.\\n\\nFADEL: Thank you.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And Rebecca Hersher brought us the scene in New York City.\\n\\nBecky, thank you very much.\\n\\nHERSHER: Thanks so much.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "Japan's Treatment Of Foreign Workers Criticized\\n\\nJapan's government has mandated research into using robots to care for its fast-growing elderly population, as it is easier than getting visas for immigrants to come and do the job. This is just one of the many signs that analysts point to in warning that Japan's insular nature is a major drag on its economy.\\n\\nROBERT SIEGEL, host:\\n\\nFrom NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.\\n\\nMICHELE NORRIS, host:\\n\\nAnd I'm Michele Norris. When the current economic downturn hit Japan, foreign workers there asked the Japanese government for assistance. They wanted financial aid to return to their home countries until the recession was over. The government gave them money on the condition that they not return to work in Japan, ever. Japan's population is aging, and it has depended on foreign workers to fill the gap. As NPR's Anthony Kuhn discovered on a trip to the heart of Japan's auto industry, the country's immigration and labor policies may not be sustainable.\\n\\n(Soundbite of crowd chatter)\\n\\nANTHONY KUHN: The brightest spot in Toyota City's Homi Danchi community is its school, the Escola Comunitaria Paulo Freire, named after a celebrated Brazilian educator. The small-but-lively schoolhouse is surrounded by shuttered shops and a rundown public housing compound. About half of the 10,000 residents here are foreigners, mostly Brazilian or Peruvian. Retiree Yoshitaka Sakuma is volunteering at the school, distributing donated bags of rice and milk powder. He estimates that 80 percent of the families in the community have suffered layoffs. Some families can no longer afford tuition, and the school's enrollment is down by half.\\n\\nMr. YOSHITAKA SAKUMA: (Through translator) Many Japanese-Brazilians were laid off and kicked out of their dormitories. Some of them came here to stay with friends or relatives, but they're hiding because this is public housing. You're not allowed to have unregistered residents.\\n\\nKUHN: Most folks here work in automobile factoring. Many of them are Nikkei, the descendents of Japanese who fled poverty in Japan a century ago and went to farm Brazil's coffee plantations. In 1990, Japan liberalized its immigration laws and welcomed the Nikkei back to Japan as its economy was booming and Brazil's was gripped by hyper inflation. Sakuma says relations between the Nikkei and Japanese have deteriorated since then.\\n\\nMr. SAKUMA: (Through translator) I think Japanese should extend a hand to the Brazilian community, but the friction between and Nikkei is, sadly to say, very serious.\\n\\nUnidentified Man: (Foreign language spoken)\\n\\nKUHN: The Brazilian-Japanese are sometimes maligned by Japanese right wingers, who cruise city streets in black vans, blaring out nationalist rhetoric. In 1999, right wingers clashed with locals in Homi Danchi, and the Nikkei firebombed one of the vans. Sakuma reckons that 10 to 20 percent of the Nikkei have accepted the government's offer of $3,000 per returnee, plus 2,000 for each dependent. But this is not an option for long-term resident who have sunk roots into Japan.\\n\\nWilton do Nascimento Silva has lived here for 12 years, welding parts and checking quality at a Toyota subsidiary. He was laid off on Christmas Day last year. He says he would never accept the government's offer of help.\\n\\nMr. WILTON DO NASCIMENTO SILVA (Autoworker): (Through translator) My wife and I have been discussing saving money for a plane ticket. I watch the news about Brazil, and it seems too wild and scary. But if my unemployment insurance runs out and if my wife loses her job, then we may have no choice but to return to Brazil.\\n\\nKUHN: The Silvas say they may go back to Brazil to wait out the recession, then return to Japan. They've stopped eating out to save money for their son Gabriel's tuition at the local school. The policy towards foreign workers has triggered criticism, including from some Japanese officials. Taro Kono is a Liberal Democratic Party member of Japan's House of Representatives.\\n\\nMr. TARO KONO (LDP Member, House of Representatives, Japan): I was a former senior vice minister for Justice, and I was in charge of this immigration. Then I said I apologize to those Brazilians or Peruvian who came to Japan with high hope. Our policy was very wrong. We just wanted the cheap labor, but we don't want to open our market to the foreign countries.\\n\\nKUHN: Even worse off than the Brazilians are some Chinese workers who come here on official work trainee or technical intern programs. Pan Wei(ph) came here from northeast China in 2006 after signing a three-year contract. After a couple of weeks of studying Japanese, she found herself on a farm, picking strawberries for half of the legal minimum wage. She remembers her first look at her spartan living quarters.\\n\\nMs. PAN WEI: (Through translator) As soon as I saw that building on the first day, my tears started to fall. I felt cheated and lost, and I wondered, how am I going to make it through the next three years?\\n\\nKUHN: Pan says she worked for up to six months with only one day off. When she asked for another day off, she was fired. Pan's case is now pending before a labor adjudication committee.\\n\\nIppei Torii is an activist and leader of the Zentoitsu Workers Union, which is assisting Pan and other foreign workers.\\n\\nMr. IPPEI TORII (Leader, Zentoitsu Workers Union): (Through translator) These folks are sometimes called $3-an-hour workers. They are not treated like human beings. They are trafficked like slaves. This kind of behavior is destroying Japan's public morals.\\n\\nKUHN: Some observers argue that Japan needs to be more open if it is to avoid further stagnation and decline. Jean-Pierre Lehmann is an Asia expert at the IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland and coauthor of a new book called Japan's Open Future.\\n\\nProfessor JEAN-PIERRE LEHMANN (Asia Expert, IMD Business School; Author): Japan just has closed in on itself. Now, why does that matter? It matters because, you know, we do live in a global age. There has to be a much greater degree of coordination. And you cannot coordinate with a country that is basically closed off.\\n\\nKUHN: Lehmann says that Japan's success in becoming Asia's first modern industrialized nation in the late 19th century was due in part to its openness. But by many standards, such as foreign investment, foreign language proficiency and number of foreign expatriates living in country, China has now surpassed Japan in openness, he says, and it will soon take Japan's place as the world's second largest economy. Lehmann says that Japan remains affluent, and its closing is a recent problem.\\n\\nProf. LEHMANN: What Japan failed to do was to address the changes that began taking place in the late '80s, early 1990s. For example, production technology became much less important than information technology. Advantage no longer was held by people who made things the best, but by people who thought things the best.\\n\\nKUHN: The most pressing problem, of course, is that Japan's population is declining and aging. And while there are people in Japan who advocate building robots to take care of the elderly, critics say that Japan will have no choice but to further open to the outside world in general and foreign workers, in particular.\\n\\nAnthony Kuhn, NPR News, Toyota City, Japan.\\n\\nCopyright © 2009 NPR.

{"original": "Fear Of Deportation Or Green Card Denial Deters Some Parents From Getting Kids Care\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images\\n\\nAs U.S. immigration enforcement becomes stricter under the Trump administration, more immigrant families are cutting ties with health care services and other critical government programs, according to child advocates who work with these families.\\n\\nIn Texas, researchers studying the issue say it's a major reason why more children are going without health insurance.\\n\\nAna, who lives in Central Texas with her husband and two children, has been increasingly hesitant to seek help from the government. In particular, she's worried about getting help for her 9-year-old daughter, Sara, who was diagnosed with autism a few years ago.\\n\\nAna entered the country without documentation about 10 years ago, which is why NPR has agreed not to use her last name. Both her children were born in the U.S. and have been covered by Medicaid for years. But ever since President Trump took office, Ana has only been using the program for basics — such as checkups and vaccinations for the kids.\\n\\nThis decision to forgo care comes at a cost. Managing Sara's behavior has been challenging, even after the diagnosis brought some clarity about what was going on. Sara acts out and has tantrums, sometimes in public places. Ana finds it difficult to soothe her daughter, and it's become more awkward as Sara grows.\\n\\nTo other people, Sara just seems spoiled or a brat, Ana says.\\n\\nAfter the diagnosis, Ana felt unsure about her next steps. She eventually went to a nonprofit in Austin that guides and supports parents whose children have disabilities. It's called Vela (candle in Spanish).\\n\\nAt Vela, Ana learned about a range of services Sara could get access to via her Medicaid plan — including therapy to help the child communicate better.\\n\\nHowever, the thought of asking for more government services for her daughter increased Ana's anxiety. I am looking for groups who are not associated with the government, Ana explains.\\n\\nAna is in the middle of the long, expensive legal process of applying for permanent resident status, known informally as a green card. Recently, the Trump administration announced that it may tighten part of this process – the public charge assessment. The assessment scrutinizes how many government services a green card applicant currently uses — or might use later in life. If a person uses many government services, they could pose a net financial burden on the federal budget — or so goes the rationale. The government's algorithms are complex, but public charge is part of the determination for who gets a green card and who doesn't.\\n\\nThe rule change proposed by the Trump administration — which may not come to pass — has already led many applicants, or would-be applicants, to be wary of all government services, even those that wouldn't affect their applications.\\n\\nI am afraid they will not give me a legal resident status, Ana says.\\n\\nHer husband already has a green card, and the couple is determined to not jeopardize Ana's ongoing application. So they have decided — just to be safe — to avoid seeking any more help from the government. That's even though their daughter, who is a citizen, needs more therapy than she's getting right now.\\n\\nI feel bad that I have to do that, Ana says.\\n\\nShe says she would love to treat her daughter's autism, but has decided that there is nothing more important than getting that green card, in order to keep the family together in the U.S.\\n\\nI'm running into families that, when it's time for re-enrollment or reapplication, they are pausing and they are questioning if they should, says Nadine Rueb, a clinical social worker dealing with Ana's case at Vela.\\n\\nRueb says a range of fears are behind immigrants avoidance of government services. Some are staying under the radar to avoid immediate deportation. Others are more like Ana — they just want to be in the best position possible to finally get permanent legal status and move on with their lives.\\n\\nThe climate of fear is so pervasive at this point, and there is so much misinformation out there, says Cheasty Anderson, a senior policy associate with the Children's Defense Fund in Texas.\\n\\nAnderson thinks the parents' fears have led to an uptick in children going without health coverage in Texas.\\n\\nA recent study from Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families found that one out of every five uninsured kids in the U.S. lives in Texas. And a big percentage of those uninsured children are Latino.\\n\\nThe report shows that after years of steady decline, the number (and percentage) of uninsured children in the U.S. increased in 2017, the first year of Trump's presidency. Nationally, 5 percent of all kids are uninsured — and in Texas the rate rose to 10.7 percent, up from 9.8 percent in 2016.\\n\\nJoan Alker, the author of the Georgetown report, says the Trump administration's effort to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration is one of many factors driving up the uninsured rates. And it's especially perceptible in Texas, where a quarter of children have a parent who is either undocumented, or who is trying to become a legal resident.\\n\\nFor these mixed-status families, there is likely a heightened fear of interacting with the government, and this may be deterring them from signing up their eligible children up for government-sponsored health care, Alker said in a phone call with reporters in November, when the report was released.\\n\\nAnderson says the repercussions fall hardest on kids with disabilities — kids who need services.\\n\\nTexas is proud to be Texas in so many ways, but this is one way in which we are failing ourselves, she says.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of Rueb, a disability rights specialist, timing is an essential issue for these children.\\n\\nThe sooner you catch [the diagnosis or condition], the sooner you support the child [and] the sooner you support the family, Rueb says. I think it's just a win-win for everybody. You are supporting the emotions of the family, and then that supports the child.\\n\\nFor now, Ana says she's relying on the services offered by her daughter's public school — which aren't counted in the federal government's public charge assessment. And she'll keep doing that until she gets that green card.\\n\\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KUT and Kaiser Health News."}
{"original": "House Intel Chairman Schiff Vows To Get Trump Jr. Phone Records — And More\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR\\n\\nAdam Schiff wants to know who Donald Trump Jr. telephoned as he was organizing the meeting at which he was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nThe chairman of the House intelligence committee told NPR he intends to use his power to convene hearings, call witnesses and get information to answer the question about whether Trump Jr., in setting up the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, spoke to his father, then-candidate Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe intelligence committee has the ability to find out and we will find out, Schiff told Morning Edition in an interview airing Thursday.\\n\\nTrump Jr. made a number of contacts in order to organize the meeting at which he, brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian delegation following the offer, via intermediaries, of support for his father's presidential campaign.\\n\\nA few of the calls Trump Jr. made were to a blocked number. Other witnesses have told Congress that Trump used a blocked number. Trump Jr. told members of Congress he didn't remember who he called.\\n\\nRevivified committee investigation\\n\\nSchiff said the intelligence committee will not go into all the president's phone calls or all the president's finances, but he said it's the panel's job to find out whether a foreign power holds leverage over the president.\\n\\nIf investigators could establish that Trump Jr. spoke to Trump as he was organizing the June 2016 meeting, it could suggest that Trump Jr. told his father that he'd received an offer of Russian help for the campaign — and that would undercut Trump's longtime denials that he knew nothing about the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and damage Clinton.\\n\\nTrump has denied any conspiracy to coordinate with Russians to influence the election. He goes back and forth as to what he accepts about the active measures that Moscow launched against the West, but he has been consistent in saying that the idea that his campaign had anything to do with those Russian efforts is a hoax.\\n\\nIn the last Congress, then-Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., wrapped up the House intelligence committee's Russia investigation with a finding of no wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe worst that could be said, the panel found, was that contacts between people on the Trump campaign and Russians were ill-advised.\\n\\nNow, with Schiff in charge and Democrats in the House majority, the panel is expected to hire new investigators, including a former prosecutor and a money laundering expert.\\n\\nThe committee's first hearing this year will examine the perceived rise of authoritarianism around the world, Schiff said.\\n\\nBut the investigations into Russia will garner more public attention. Schiff said he wants Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer who has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for multiple crimes including campaign finance violations, to appear before the committee this year.\\n\\nCohen also is scheduled to testify before the House oversight committee next month.\\n\\nThe White House Counsel's Office has been reportedly adding attorneys to prepare for legal fights with Democrats. A number of incoming Democratic chairmen beyond Schiff — including Elijah Cummings, D-Md., of the oversight panel, and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — want to expand investigations into Trump.\\n\\nSchiff told NPR he expects the administration to stonewall his committee on any legitimate oversight it does.\\n\\nOne battle could involve whether the committee will again try to subpoena the interpreter who was present for Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last July.\\n\\nRecent reports show the president has gone to unusual lengths to keep secret the details of what he has said to Putin in meetings in Finland and elsewhere.\\n\\nSchiff said he's examining the legal issues around either bringing in the interpreter, or getting the interpreter notes, or finding out through others in the administration what took place.\\n\\nThe White House may argue that Trump's dealings with interpreters and other staff members are protected under executive privilege, but Schiff called that interpretation of the privilege superficial, since the inquiry isn't focused on what American officials have been saying to each other inside the administration.\\n\\nWe're not interested in when he was talking to his counselors, Schiff said of the president. We're interested in what he was talking to Vladimir Putin about, and doesn't seem to me that any privilege applies there.\\n\\nTranscript of the interview between NPR's Steve Inskeep and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The interview has been edited for clarity.\\n\\nSteve Inskeep: I want to just begin by understanding how you see your new position here. How do you intend to run this committee differently than your predecessor?\\n\\nRep. Adam Schiff: Well I have to think in just about every way. You know, certainly as it pertains to the Russian investigation we want to go back to the original mission which was to follow the facts wherever they lead and try to conduct this in a bipartisan way. You know probably going back to the midnight run. The then-Chairman Nunes late night excursion to the White House to get information that he would later present to the White House says demonstrating some Obama conspiracy to surveil the Trump campaign going back to that date. The Republicans left essentially trying to find out what the Russians did and how they did it and the role of the Trump campaign and embarked instead on an investigation of the investigators became essentially a surrogate for the Trump defense team. Obviously that's going to change we're going to go back to our original mission of following the facts. So we're already reaching out to witnesses that we wanted to come in but we couldn't get the then majority to either request or subpoena. We're going to get documents that we need to get to do our investigative work. But more broadly we want to take a deep dive on issues that we think have been neglected and our first open hearing next month will be on the subject of the rise of a — on the subject of the rise of authoritarianism around the world. And this to me is the much bigger picture than Russian interference in our election, bigger even than Russian interference in the elections of others that has been going on for some time in Europe and elsewhere. We see a real rise of autocracy around the globe everywhere from the Philippines with Duterte to Turkey with Erdogan, Al-Sisi in Egypt the rise of the far right in Hungary and Poland. That challenge to liberal democracy is going unanswered by this administration. And we want to shed light on this.\\n\\nWhy would you begin the Russia investigation again, granting you didn't like the way that Devin Nunes did it or that his colleagues did it? There's been a Senate investigation that was seen as credible and bipartisan. There's the Mueller investigation. What could you add?\\n\\nWell, first of all, we never shut down the Russia investigation. The Republicans walked away from it, but we continued to bring in witnesses, but we didn't have the power to subpoena them or compel their testimony. And that didn't allow us to do a thorough job. In fact the report the Republicans issued has already been completely discredited. They relied on for among other things. Michael Cohen's testimony and other witnesses without checking to see whether any of it was accurate. Now that's no way to conduct an investigation.\\n\\nCohen has since admitted to lying under oath.\\n\\nHe has and we are going to be bringing him back before the committee to explore what areas were truthful and what weren't. And it's not just that we need to bring back certain witnesses. There are a great many that have never come before our committee, a great many unanswered questions and even had we been able to continue uninterrupted — and we've lost about nine months of time — the special counsel's investigation continues as does the Senate intelligence investigation. And we see in the testimony of Bill Barr just how important it is that the congressional investigations go on and I say that because Barr testified that he is not committing to sharing the Mueller report with the Congress or the country.\\n\\nThis is the attorney general nominee. Right.\\n\\nExactly. And we, I guess, can expect he's going to give us a Cliff Notes\\n\\nversion that he will write himself. This means that the country may never learn about information that does not go into an indictment. And that just is completely unsatisfactory. The country deserves to know what the Russians did in our elections, what role the president played or his campaign associates played. And to have a situation where the nominee for attorney general says you can't indict a sitting president, you can only impeach one if it's warranted — but we're not going to give you the evidence to determine whether impeachment is i n order — means we're not gonna have a rule of law. We're going to have immunity. And that just cannot persist.\\n\\nYou think it is worth then going over the very same ground Mueller has gone over perhaps because you can do it in a way that you would develop public information.\\n\\nI think there are areas that Mueller may not be investigating that need to be investigated because he may or may not be given the charter by the deputy attorney general or acting attorney general.\\n\\nWhat's an example?\\n\\nMoney laundering. Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump businesses? This compromise the Russians hold over the president of the United States — we don't know the answer to that question, but we also don't know whether Bob Mueller has been allowed to investigate that issue. The president has tried to draw a red line around it. In my view, the president has no business drawing red lines. But nonetheless we don't know whether that has been investigated. But we do know it needs to be. But even areas where Mueller is investigating if it's going to be the position of the incoming attorney general, should Barr be confirmed, that the public doesn't get to learn about this, then it will fall upon Congress to share with the American people what happened and we will do that in several ways. We will do that by trying to compel that report to be provided to Congress but we'll also do it by developing the record ourselves and by sharing with the country the product of our investigation.\\n\\nIs that why you were hiring among other staff members a former prosecutor and an expert in money laundering?\\n\\nWe are adding to the investigative capabilities of our committee in our staffing when we began the rush investigation. Our staff was what you would expect an intelligence committee staff to be comprised of — largely analysts, experts in the intelligence community, experts in doing oversight of the agencies so that we could make sure that they were sharing information to protect the country, not stove-piping it. That was one of the problems identified in the 9/11 Commission report ... The Constitutional and statutory obligations are being met but then we have this huge investigation also added to our responsibilities. But our staff were still the same analysts. Now over time we brought on additional staff. But there is still considerable need to bring on more investigative heft. And so we are interviewing candidates with an eye towards doing that.\\n\\nAnd what I said is correct: A money laundering expert ... a ... former prosecutor ... will be on that staff?\\n\\nYou know, I can certainly share with you that we are going to be hiring people with investigative experience. And while I don't want to go into the particulars until we have people on board we're ready to share that information. We are looking to fill areas of expertise that we don't feel we have sufficiently in place and because the end of the day we want to make sure that we can represent to the public we've done a thorough and credible investigation and this is what we were able to find.\\n\\nIt has been said that the president, before he became president, did large scale real estate deals and paid for a number of them in cash rather than financing, which is unusual in real estate. Do you intend to find out where the cash came from?\\n\\nWell we are certainly going to try to follow the money and the president's sons have also said — this compounds our concerns at various points in time — that they don't need the help or money from U.S. banks. They get all the cash they need from Russia.\\n\\nThis is a quote from one of the president's sons about a decade ago.\\n\\nYes. And I think one of the sons also said that a disproportionate share of their assets come from Russia. Now, the president has tried to disavow those remarks much like he has tried to disavow comments that he himself has made in the past that he was getting tens of millions of dollars from the Saudis and why shouldn't he like the Saudis the Saudis are spending so much money on his properties. If foreign money is influencing his decisions, that's a problem. If foreign business entanglement, lawful or unlawful, is compromise that the Russians or others hold over the president of the United States, that's a problem and it needs to be exposed.\\n\\nLet me ask about one detail that many people have asked questions about: There was a famous meeting as you know in 2016 involving Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, top campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. There were two phone calls from Donald Trump Jr. to a blocked number before and after that meeting, if I'm not mistaken. Do you have the ability to find out who he called and do you intend to find out?\\n\\nWe do have the ability to find out and we will find out. And what you're referring to is in the setup of that meeting, and, by the way, two of the people in that meeting have been indicted already: Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney, who we have learned more and more about and her relationship with the Russian government. In the setup of that meeting, the son of a Russian oligarch arranges to speak with Don Jr., the president's son. The president's son is informed in advance of these conversations that the Russians have dirt on Hillary Clinton that they want to share as part of what is described as the Russian government effort to help the Trump campaign. And the president's son's reaction is that he would love that help. And so there are these calls going back and forth between Don Jr. and Emin Agalarov, the son of Aras Agalarov, an oligarch close to Putin. Oddly enough Aras Agalarov is known as the Russian Donald Trump because he's a real estate magnate in Russia. Sandwiched between these calls where the president's son is trying to find out, Is this a meeting I should take, is this offer for real, should I bring in the campaign chairman, my brother in law? There's a call from a blocked number. We need to find out who that blocked call is from.\\n\\nAnd this is knowable? The phone company has this information? It can be subpoenaed?\\n\\nIt's perfectly knowable. And of course when we brought in Don Jr. and asked him about the call and the obvious question was, We know that then-candidate Trump used a blocked call during the campaign. Was this call from Dad? And when we sought with our Republican colleagues to get an answer in the most definitive way possible — that is get the phone records — the response from the Republicans was, No. We don't want to know.\\n\\nNow, I can't imagine a more obvious investigative step than getting those phone records, but we were denied the ability to do that and that, in microcosm, was what the Republican-led investigation was about. It wasn't about finding out answers. It was about going through the motions of investigation so that a political report could be issued and they could absolve the president. That's not what they promised the American people they would do, but that is what they did. So we still need to get answers and one of the places we will begin is by getting those phone records.\\n\\nIf you're going into all the president's phone calls, if you are going into all the president's finances, and perhaps an extensive look at his business career, at what point would that become a witch hunt?\\n\\nWell we're certainly not going to go into all the president's phone calls or all the president's finances. You know, whether the president was engaged in shady business transactions with people, that's not my job to find out. It is my job to find out whether a foreign power holds leverage over the president. So what I am concerned about, what we do need to look into is: Was he doing business with the Russians? Was it lawful business? Is it business that he is now denying and do the Russians have leverage over him? And to give you a perfect illustration of why this is so important, we've already learned through Michael Cohen that the business that he was trying to cultivate during the campaign went on much longer than has been acknowledged in effect.\\n\\nQuite the contrary. Michael Cohen testified it was over at the beginning of the year 2016. We now know it went on through the middle of that year. Even when Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee for president and was denying any business dealings with Russia, he was in fact pursuing a multi-multi-million dollar project in Moscow and seeking the Kremlin's help to make it happen. Now, the Russians knew this even as the president was denying it ... the Russians were on the other end of that transaction, which means at any point in time of the Russians' choosing they could expose the president's falsehoods about this and that is compromise. Now it's come to the public's attention recently the president may have tried to acquire or destroy the records of his private conversations with Putin over the last couple of years. Why is that? Why does he demand to meet alone with Putin? Why does he demand that there be no record of his discussions with Putin? This is extraordinarily worrying behavior by the president of United States.\\n\\nLast year when you did not have the power, you had to ask Republicans. You called for the interpreter from the president's private meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland to be subpoenaed to testify. Now that you do have the power, do you intend to subpoena that interpreter?\\n\\nWe intend to do everything we can to find out what took place in these private meetings and we are examining the legal issues around either bringing in the interpreter or getting the interpreter notes or finding out through others administration what took place.\\n\\nWhat are the legal issues?\\n\\nWell, you know, they may make a superficial claim of executive privilege but when you look at executive privilege, that privilege applies when the president is talking to his advisers, seeking their counsel and the policy reason behind it is that he should be able to get the unfettered advice of his counselors to make decisions. But we're not interested in when he was talking to his counselors about. We're interested in what he was talking to Vladimir Putin about and doesn't seem to me that any privilege applies there. But that doesn't mean they won't claim one. And so we are investigating the legal issues around it.\\n\\nAt the end of the day though, we need to find out whether the president behind closed doors is sacrificing U.S. interests because of some personal motivation. That's to me is the overriding and compelling interest here.\\n\\nCould there have been a comparatively innocent explanation for the president not wanting to tell other people in the government about his meetings with Putin? He clearly doesn't trust a lot of people in the government. He talks constantly about a deep state. He may simply not have believed that other people in the government could be relied upon with this information.\\n\\nI suppose if you work really hard at it you can fashion a rationalization for his behavior. But if you look at what he does quite overtly, what he did in public with Vladimir Putin when in Helsinki, for example, he said, Well, I've got my intelligence agencies telling me you interfered in our election but you're telling me you didn't and I don't know why you would. Basically, I believe you over our intelligence agencies. If he is saying that publicly, what is he saying privately? That seems to be the far more probable issue, that he does not want the public to know what he is saying, to the degree that he doesn't trust the people around him, perhaps because they recognize that what he is doing, as indeed General Mattis did, is inimical to our national interests.\\n\\nIf the White House disagrees with you about executive privilege on a matter like the president's interpreter, you're prepared to go to court?\\n\\nWell, this is a decision that we will have to make in discussion with our leadership and I'm already coordinating with Eliot Engel, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, because what we are going to have to do as an over-arching matter is prioritize what fights we're going to have with this administration. We know they're going to stonewall us on whatever legitimate oversight we do and it means we're going to have to put our most important fights first and make sure that we are prepared for them. And so that's a decision we will have to make. But to me it seems imperative that we know whether the president of the United States is doing our bidding or his own family's bidding when he's in private discussions with a foreign adversary.\\n\\nWhen you were saying the reasons you need to redo this investigation, you said that William Barr, if he's attorney general, may not give you the evidence that you would need to decide whether something impeachable has taken place. And so you're doing your investigation. Can we then draw that conclusion that that is where this may be headed? That the purpose of this investigation is to find out whether there is an impeachable offense first?\\n\\nYou know again we have never stopped the investigation so I wouldn't say that we'll need to redo it or reopen it. But we will need to continue it until we get answers until we are able to follow the facts wherever they lead. I don't want to prejudge what the conclusion is. In terms of what the remedy ought to be I'd like to finish our work. I'd like to make sure that we get the product of Bob Mueller's report as well.\\n\\nMy point is that we can't have a situation where the president is effectively immunized against any consequence because the Justice Department takes the view that notwithstanding whether they would find evidence of criminality he cannot be indicted and that they will not share evidence with the Congress that would allow Congress to pursue any other remedy. That simply cannot be the policy of the Congress or the Justice Department that the president is above the law because that would effectively make the president above the law, neither subject to indictment nor impeachment.\\n\\nIs there any other aspect of the intelligence agencies that comes under your vast purview that has nothing to do with the president of Russia that strikes you as urgent that you need to dig into?\\n\\nCertainly I will. I don't know that I can say that has nothing to do with the president because, you know, all of the national security challenges facing the country in one way or another implicate presidential action. But we also expect to do a deep dive on Saudi Arabia to learn more about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We need to analyze the Saudi role in Yemen, the Saudi role in Syria, the Saudi role in the peace process ... how stable is the House of Saud. What are the risks to placing so much reliance on the crown prince? We're gonna do a deep dive on all those issues. We're also going to be examining North Korea.\\n\\nWe've been assured by our president it's essentially problem solved, we can all sleep well. Now, that is not what we're seeing. We are not seeing a North Korea on an inexorable path towards denuclearization. So we'll continue to do a heavy focus on North Korea as well as on Iran and the threat posed from Iran. And we will be devoting a lot of our attention to the war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria and Yemen for the risks they pose to us from a counterterrorism point of view but also the risks they pose to our men and women in uniform.\\n\\nDo you expect this committee to do more of its work in public than it traditionally has?\\n\\nYes. And, you know, even, you know, very basic public hearings were foreclosed by the previous majority for reasons I'm still not clear about. We have traditionally done quarterly worldwide threats hearings — open hearings that are followed by a closed session in which the leaders of the intelligence agencies testify publicly about what's keeping them up at night. As I mentioned, you know, our first hearing will be hearing an open hearing on the rise of authoritarianism. I want to do a lot more in open session.\\n\\nWe're also going to look at within the Russia investigation what hearings or witnesses we might be able to bring in in an open session as well as releasing transcripts of witnesses who have come before our committee, so those are things all things that we are exploring.\\n\\nShould William Barr recuse himself from the Russia investigation if he's confirmed as the new attorney general?\\n\\nI do think he should. And I think it's astounding that we are at a point in history now where the ethical bar has been so lowered that an attorney general nominee can come before the U.S. Senate and say, I'm not willing to commit that I will follow the advice of ethics lawyers at the Justice Department. Is this really where we are? Shouldn't we expect at a minimum that any attorney general will agree to follow the advice of ethics lawyers? I think the problem here is he knows what that advice is going to be and that advice is going to be just the same as the advice to [Acting Attorney General] Matt Whitaker and for precisely the same reason: You have expressed publicly hostility to the Mueller investigation. You will not have public confidence if you play a role in that investigation. You should recuse.\\n\\nThe reason why he won't commit to follow their advice is because he knows what their advice is going to be and because if he were willing to do so, he would not have been nominated. That's a problem. We should demand better than that. You know it's astounding to me that the only two people apparently qualified to serve as acting attorney general or new attorney general are people who have already weighed in against the Mueller investigation before they were even appointed or nominated. That just shows how low the bar is. I don't think we have to accept that I don't think we should accept that there are a great many very well qualified conservative lawyers who could be nominated for attorney general."}

Namely, they must include historic landmarks or other objects of historic or scientific interest, and they must not exceed the smallest area necessary for their upkeep.\\n\\nAround the Nation Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Reviews Bears Ears National Monument Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Reviews Bears Ears National Monument Listen · 3:46 3:46\\n\\nAt issue is whether the presidents who created the monuments overstepped their authority. But just as important to those who live around the sites is whether they restrict the economy and ignore local interests.\\n\\nBears Ears, established last year by President Barack Obama, is the first on Zinke's list. But a second Utah site, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, offers a more comprehensive glimpse into the controversy that eddies around many of the monuments — and a revealing peek into what Zinke may ultimately recommend to the president.\\n\\nSo, here it is: a tour of Grand Staircase-Escalante. That is, a tour of the national monument's economic impact, the political cloud surrounding it — and what we can expect once Zinke's decision comes down.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bob Wick/BLM/Flickr Bob Wick/BLM/Flickr\\n\\nThe economics\\n\\nSo, what is the benefit or harm of having a national monument in your neighborhood?\\n\\nAccording to Headwaters Economics, a Montana-based think tank that crunched the data on jobs and the economy around 17 of the national monuments under review, the effect is anywhere from nothing to a modest net positive.\\n\\nChris Mehl, the group's policy director, says that from 2001 to 2015, overall jobs in the communities around Grand Staircase, in particular, increased by 24 percent and personal income overall grew by 32 percent.\\n\\nThese jobs are believed to be mostly service based, in fields that include everything from health care to hospitality, outdoor recreation and tourism.\\n\\nThe monument lies within two rural counties in southern Utah, home to about 12,000 residents and about a half-dozen towns across an area that's nearly 10,000 square miles in size.\\n\\nMehl says the economies of rural Western communities like the one around Grand Staircase have changed dramatically, with huge social impacts we're just coming to grips with. So other, larger economic factors may be involved.\\n\\nBut there's no sign of an economic apocalypse here, he says.\\n\\nCommissioners in rural Garfield County, Utah, have long seen it differently.\\n\\nIn 2015, they passed a resolution declaring a state of emergency, saying the monument had all but wiped out the natural resource-based economy in the area. They cited a remarkable 67 percent drop in enrollment at Escalante High School since the monument was designated, while other schools have suffered similar drops.\\n\\nWe see markers that don't indicate a healthy economy, says Matthew Anderson of the Sutherland Institute, a Utah-based free market think tank. He argues that Headwaters' study doesn't tell the whole story.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Doug Mills/AP Doug Mills/AP\\n\\nLocal anger still runs deep over President Bill Clinton's 1996 designation because it also effectively nixed a proposed coal mining operation. A Dutch mining firm's proposal could have brought in $100 million in new tax revenue and created about 600 jobs, according to state estimates at the time.\\n\\nAnderson argues the types of jobs created by a national monument designation — namely in recreation and tourism — tend to be low-paying and seasonal, and he says these jobs don't always sustain families the way livestock grazing does. A national monument grandfathers existing activities like grazing leases but bars new ones.\\n\\nSome residents throw cold water on the idea of shaky employment.\\n\\nWe are awash in jobs, Blake Spalding, co-owner of a local grill, tells The Salt Lake Tribune. What we need is people to fill them.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images George Frey/Getty Images\\n\\nThe politics\\n\\nThe debate around Grand Staircase by no means ends with the balance sheet.\\n\\nNinety-three percent of Garfield County is owned and controlled by the federal government. And for some detractors, like former Escalante Mayor Jerry Taylor, the federal presence feels akin to that of an unwelcome relative.\\n\\nWe love our mother-in-law, he once said, according to E&E News. But sometimes we don't want her to tell us how to run our house.\\n\\nThose detractors have not forgotten how the monument was established in the first place: planned largely without input from state leaders and designated by Clinton at a signing ceremony that wasn't even in Utah.\\n\\nRemember, Zinke said during a visit to the state, according to The Tribune, when this monument was formed, the governor of Utah read it in the paper.\\n\\nAs recently as February, Utah lawmakers called on Washington to reduce the size of the monument, citing a negative impact on the prosperity, development, economy, custom, culture, heritage, educational opportunities, health, and well-being of local communities — among other grievances.\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nNevertheless, when Zinke visited Grand Staircase last month, he was greeted by chants of demonstrators calling for him to save our monument, the St. George Spectrum & Daily News notes.\\n\\nThe site — flush with ancient artifacts and fossils that date back tens of millions of years — has been lauded as the Shangri-La for dinosaurs. And proponents defend its value not only for recreational visitors, but also for scientists.\\n\\nWhat we learn here matters to the entire West, Nicole Croft, executive director of Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners, tells E&E News.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chad Douglas/Flickr Chad Douglas/Flickr\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThe ultimate fate of the monuments is murky partly because a president's authority under the law that established them, the 1906 Antiquities Act, may be open to dispute.\\n\\nWhat's unclear right now is whether the president has the authority to undo what one of his predecessors has done, says Mark Squillace, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. The act essentially authorizes the president to proclaim, but not to modify or revoke, national monuments.\\n\\nSquillace says only Congress has the clear authority to revoke a designation because Congress has authority over public property.\\n\\nWhile some small monuments have been turned over to states, no precedent exists for the abolition of a national monument the size of Grand Staircase.\\n\\nBecause of that lack of clarity, one thing is fairly clear: Any order by Trump to shrink or nullify any monument will almost certainly end up in court. It is widely expected that environmentalists would immediately sue.\\n\\nSquillace says the dispute could go all the way to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nEven Zinke himself hinted at the uncertainty during his confirmation hearings earlier this year.\\n\\nThe law is untested, he said."}
{"original": "Latino Voters Move To Defend Census Immigrant Count In Lawsuit By Alabama\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\\n\\nUpdated 4:05 p.m. ET, July 19\\n\\nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is asking a federal judge in Alabama to allow a group of Latino voters and the advocacy group Chicanos Por La Causa to defend a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Census Bureau's policy of including unauthorized immigrants in census numbers used to redistribute seats in Congress. The city of San Jose, Calif., Santa Clara County in California and King County in Washington joined them and filed a similar motion in court on July 17.\\n\\nOnce a decade, the bureau counts every person living in the U.S. — regardless of immigration status — for the census required by the Constitution, as the Census Bureau's acting director recently told NPR. After the Civil War, the 14th Amendment was ratified to mandate the counting of the whole number of persons in each state.\\n\\nThat population tally determines the number of seats in the House of Representatives, as well as Electoral College votes in presidential elections, that each state gets.\\n\\nIn May, the state of Alabama and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. They argue that the framers of the Constitution did not intend for the census numbers to include immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. In their complaint, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, alleges that after the upcoming 2020 census, the state may lose one of its seven congressional seats and one of its nine Electoral College votes to a state with a higher population of unauthorized immigrants.\\n\\nAlabama's complaint calls for the Census Bureau to exclude unauthorized immigrants from census numbers used for reapportionment.\\n\\nAdding a question regarding immigration status [to the census questionnaire] is one of several possible methods of excluding illegal aliens from the count used for apportionment, says a spokesperson for Alabama's attorney general, Mike Lewis, in an email.\\n\\nThe reason why this has become so much more of an issue now than maybe it would have, you know, however many years ago is really the number of those who are in this country currently illegally, Marshall said in June after a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the census where he testified about the lawsuit. It's part of, I guess, a little bit of the national debate that we have right now about the enforcement of our immigration laws and what we've allowed.\\n\\nThe Justice Department has assigned one of its attorneys, Brad Rosenberg, to the case. But the Trump administration has not yet filed a response to the complaint, which is due in court by Sept. 13, after a federal judge granted Rosenberg's request to extend the original deadline. A DOJ spokesperson, Devin O'Malley, declined to comment on when the department plans to file its reply and on the motions to intervene.\\n\\nAt a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in May on the new citizenship question on the 2020 census, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, John Gore, was asked by Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., to comment on the importance of knowing the citizenship status of people counted for congressional reapportionment.\\n\\nI think that is a very important question and a very important issue, Gore replied. It's not one that the Department of Justice has taken a position on.\\n\\nThe federal government's largest statistical agency has long included citizens of foreign countries living in the U.S. in national population counts.\\n\\nWe have real concerns about whether the Trump administration, which is the defendant in the case, would actually put forward a vigorous defense of their continued counting of all persons as persons, says Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of MALDEF.\\n\\nOn July 12, MALDEF filed a motion to intervene in the case on behalf of Chicanos Por La Causa and individual Latino voters from Arizona, California, Florida and Texas — states with high populations of Latino residents and unauthorized immigrants. In the court filing, Saenz argues that excluding unauthorized immigrants from census numbers could deny the communities where they live fair political representation.\\n\\nThis is really attempting to reopen a debate that we haven't had in this country since the Civil War, he says, noting the original language in the Constitution specifying that enslaved people should be counted as three fifths of all other Persons.\\n\\nAttorneys for the city of San Jose, Calif., California's Santa Clara County and Washington's King County say their plaintiffs can lose access to federal dollars tied to census numbers if unauthorized immigrants are excluded from their population counts.\\n\\nEach of these jurisdictions is home to vibrant immigrant communities that also happen to include large numbers of undocumented people, says Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the legal groups representing San Jose and the two counties. They too stand to lose a significant share of federal funding if Alabama prevails in this case.\\n\\nTheir court filing cites NPR's recent interview with the Census Bureau's Acting Director Ron Jarmin, who noted that whether it's funding for streets or for schools or for health care, decisions throughout the federal government are made based on the population of the local communities that people live in.\\n\\nAlabama's lawsuit against the Census Bureau comes as the agency is facing six separate lawsuits over a decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, to add a controversial question about U.S. citizenship status to the 2020 census. More than two dozen states and cities, as well as other groups, want the question removed because of fears of discouraging noncitizens from participating and harming the accuracy of the head count.\\n\\nWhile Ross has said the Justice Department needs responses from the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, a federal judge in New York City has said internal documents the Trump administration released suggest the decision to add the question may be politically motivated. In an email to Ross, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach suggested wording for a census citizenship question that asks noncitizens about their immigration status, after highlighting the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional reapportionment purposes.\\n\\nThe Census Bureau referred a request for comment about the motions to intervene to the Commerce Department, which is also named in the Alabama lawsuit. A spokesperson for Commerce declined to comment.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Brooks deferred to the Alabama's attorney general's office for comment on MALDEF's filing, but a spokesperson for Marshall also declined to comment. Neither spokesperson has responded to NPR's inquiries about the motion by attorneys for San Jose, California's Santa Clara County and Washington's King County.\\n\\nAsked by a reporter after the House hearing in June whether he has any expectation that the Trump administration will defend the Census Bureau in this lawsuit, Brooks told NPR that he had not spoken with anyone in the administration about what position it will take.\\n\\nThe Trump administration itself is going to have to decide whether they want to reward sanctuary states by giving them more congressional seats and more Electoral College votes than they would be due based solely on account of American citizens or foreigners who are lawfully in the U.S., he said."}
{"original": "At N.H. Rally Ahead Of Iowa, Biden Makes Appeal To Voters' Morality\\n\\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa, many voters seem to care more about the former vice president's one-on-one interactions than the content of his speeches.\\n\\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, HOST:\\n\\nJoe Biden has been campaigning for one political office or another for decades. The former vice president is, perhaps, the most seasoned politician running for president this year, and that's obvious at his rallies. NPR's Asma Khalid has been following Biden on his campaign trail and shares this report.\\n\\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Joe Biden's events don't have the electric vibe of a rock concert you might see from some of his progressive rivals. The crowds are more orderly and elderly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, pardon me, folks. You guys all signed in?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We're following her.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, beautiful. OK. No, you're good to go. How's it going, sir?\\n\\nKHALID: But his supporters are still excited to see him. Before heading to Iowa for the final sprint, he was here in Salem, N.H. Dozens of people are lined up in the cold - voters from New Hampshire and quite a few from just across the state line in Massachusetts, some with their Dunkin' Donuts coffee in hand as they waited to enter a local elementary school gym. One of them was Maryann Bradley from neighboring Massachusetts.\\n\\nMARYANN BRADLEY: I think he wants to unite the country, and I think we need that right now. I think we need someone who can bring everybody together. And I think he has a tremendous amount of experience, more than anybody else.\\n\\nKHALID: Maryann and her husband Tom are fans of their home state senator, Elizabeth Warren. But their decision is not just about who they like.\\n\\nBRADLEY: I think that Joe Biden has a better chance of beating Trump. I really do. I don't think people will vote for her.\\n\\nKHALID: It's about pragmatism. And that's a common theme at Biden rallies. I bypass the clipboards and stickers and the line of voters signing up for Biden campaign updates, and I make my way inside.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: You're with the press, then? OK. Come on in. Come on in here.\\n\\nKHALID: OK. Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Just - OK. We have some of the press coming through.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance.\\n\\nKHALID: One common ritual at Biden rallies is the pledge. It's not a tradition for all Democrats.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED GROUP: I pledge allegiance to the flag...\\n\\nKHALID: After the pledge, supporters of Biden, people who are well-known in New Hampshire politics, get up to talk about why they support the former vice president. And then it's time for the candidate.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN)\\n\\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) We take care of our own.\\n\\nKHALID: Biden strolls through an overflow crowd, shaking hands and flashing smiles as Bruce Springsteen's song We Take Care Of Our Own plays on loudspeakers. It's a song Barack Obama used during his 2012 reelection.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN: Hello. Hello. Hello.\\n\\nKHALID: Biden takes the mic out of the podium stand so he can roam around the room as he talks. There's no stage. He's in the middle - people on chairs all around him. It's one of the more intimate setups you see on the campaign trail. Biden warns the crowd that there has never been a more consequential election in recent history.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBIDEN: Four years of Donald Trump, as my grandfather Finnegan would say - the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors - can go down in history as a aberration in political history of America. But eight years...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBIDEN: But eight years of Donald Trump, I honest to God believe will change the character of the nation.\\n\\nKHALID: Biden often quotes his grandpa. It's one of his so-called Bidenisms (ph). You might not hear them all in every speech, but they are his trademark way of conveying earnestness.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\\n\\nBIDEN: My Lord.\\n\\nHere's the deal.\\n\\nBut all kidding aside...\\n\\nNot a joke, not a joke.\\n\\nI promise you. I promise you.\\n\\nKHALID: Biden's campaign speech is about character, country and unity. It's about aspiring to a better time. He doesn't mention his Democratic rivals by name. Biden mostly talks about President Trump as if he's the only opponent. He is the former vice president. And he readily mentions Barack Obama's name, plus his own experience on health care, foreign policy and gun control. But more than policy, his speech is an appeal to morality.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBIDEN: I understand this new Republican Party. They've gone after me, telling lies about me, my surviving son. They've gone after him. They've gone after my whole family. So I get them. I understand them. But guess what? A president has to be willing to fight but also has to be willing to unite. He has to be able to heal.\\n\\nKHALID: Biden spoke for about a half an hour. He doesn't always stick to the script and meanders around. He took no questions from the crowd and no questions from the press. A major part of his appeal to voters, though, is not actually what he says in his speeches but the one-on-one interactions he has with them afterwards - the hugs, photos and the bits of conversation.\\n\\nBIDEN: What's your name?\\n\\nBRUCE: Bruce, with my daughter Gabrielle.\\n\\nGABRIELLE: Hi.\\n\\nBIDEN: Hi, Gabrielle. How are you?\\n\\nJOAN MERCIER: He's just so believable. I love him.\\n\\nKHALID: That last voice is Joan Mercier.\\n\\nWas there anybody else you had been considering?\\n\\nMERCIER: Well, I did like Buttigieg. I'm not - I'm more towards Joe Biden, though, because of his age and his wisdom and his - the fact that he's been a vice president.\\n\\nKHALID: She says the country needs someone who can quickly clean up Trump's mess and doesn't need on-the-job training. Biden's age, she feels, could be an asset. But there are plenty of Democrats who worry that age is his liability. Some say his events are underwhelming and remind them of Hillary Clinton, which worries them.\\n\\nFor Jim Battis, this was his second time hearing Joe Biden in person.\\n\\nJIM BATTIS: To be quite honest, I had seen him once before, and he looked old.\\n\\nKHALID: Battis said Biden impressed him more this time.\\n\\nBATTIS: Here, he seems invigorated and has a reason to run, not just, I'm here because everybody expects me to be here.\\n\\nKHALID: What gives you any hesitation with Biden?\\n\\nBATTIS: It's still his age. I don't know. Maybe that's age bias on my part.\\n\\nKHALID: Battis is 72, and he's not sure someone in their 70s has the energy to be president.\\n\\nAsma Khalid, NPR News.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF HUNTERTONES' FARA)\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "U.S. Senator On Meeting With Ukraine President Zelenskiy\\n\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\\n\\nWe're going to begin today's program discussing relations with Ukraine, where a bipartisan group of U.S. senators recently met with that country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The meeting comes in the wake of the impeachment trial, which centered on the now infamous July 25 call between President Trump and Zelenskiy and allegations that Trump was engaged in a pressure campaign on Ukraine.\\n\\nEven though the trial is now over, impeachment has strained relations between the two countries. Earlier today, President Zelenskiy spoke about his relationship with President Trump, saying he took issue with Trump's characterization of Ukraine as a corrupt nation. But he also said he's open to another call with President Trump. The U.S. has been Ukraine's most important backer in its conflict with Russia.\\n\\nHere to tell us more about his meeting with President Zelenskiy and what might come next is Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. He's also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is with us now from Germany, where he's attending the Munich Security Conference.\\n\\nThanks for joining us, Senator.\\n\\nCHRIS MURPHY: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nFADEL: So you went with two Republican Senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Barrasso of Wyoming. Why did you feel like it was so important to do this right now with your Republican colleagues? And how did the meeting go?\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, we obviously voted very differently on impeachment. We have different feelings about what the president did. But we got together during the impeachment proceedings and decided that as soon as it was over, we were going to go to Ukraine because we wanted to deliver the message that notwithstanding that crisis, there remains Republican-Democratic support for that country, and we want to figure out a way to move on.\\n\\nNow, I don't think the president has fully moved on, in part because, you know, we still don't have an ambassador. We don't have a new special envoy. The meeting in the White House still has not happened. But Congress, at least, can make sure that money continues to flow and that we still, you know, have high-level delegations showing support for Ukraine and the new president, who's doing a fantastic job. And while the relationship is not back on sound footing, I think it's important for us to get beyond impeachment and show to the Ukrainian people that the American people are still with them.\\n\\nFADEL: What did President Zelenskiy ask for in that meeting? You know, the U.S. has been a key backer of Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea - $1.5 billion in aid since 2014, aid that was central to this impeachment trial because it was briefly held up. What did he want? What does he want with this relationship?\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, I mean, he wants to know that we have his back. His No. 1 priority is ending hostilities with Russia in Eastern Ukraine and in Crimea. And he can't do that if Russia perceives there to be weakness. Russia right now, I think, has questions as to whether the United States is going to be with Ukraine in the long run. What Russia really wants is to occupy Eastern Ukraine for long enough that the Ukrainians just give up. They give in, and they decide to arrange a settlement of accounts with Russia.\\n\\nAnd the key to convincing Russia that Ukraine is never going to give in is that the United States is going to continue to support them until the Russians give in and give Ukraine back to the Ukrainian people. And so he's nervous. I think he's still nervous that that commitment isn't there because the things that were the subject of the impeachment inquiry, like the meeting in the White House, still hasn't happened. And so that just is further confirmation that we have more work to do.\\n\\nFADEL: I'm curious, though - a meeting like this, how much water does it hold with a leader like President Zelenskiy? President Trump has a history of contradicting people in his own administration on policy issues, so when you go into this meeting, do they have faith that you're bringing a real message from the U.S.?\\n\\nMURPHY: I think they want us to take a stronger role in this relationship, and I want Congress to take a stronger role. Remember, we can say whatever we want in funding legislation. We could tie the president's hands and make it impossible for him to hold this money back. And, you know, I hope that we consider that. I hope that when we write the next funding bill for Ukraine, we think about ways where we can guarantee that the money won't - you know, there won't be games being played with the money.\\n\\nSo I think we can take some independent steps in Congress to try to strengthen the relationship and make sure that they know that the funding stream isn't going to be interrupted again.\\n\\nFADEL: As we mentioned, this was a bipartisan group. Were you and your Republican colleagues on the same page in that meeting? And are you on the same page when you talk about Congress taking a stronger role?\\n\\nMURPHY: I hope so. I'm here in Munich now at a security conference, which has been attended by a number of Republican and Democratic members of Congress. I'm talking to all of them about new legislation supporting Ukraine. You know, I did raise in the meeting with President Zelenskiy this question of Rudy Giuliani's continued presence in Ukraine, and I reminded him that it's really important for them to continue to resist any efforts or temptations to get involved in American elections.\\n\\nAnd, you know, I'm raising that issue. The Republicans in the meeting aren't raising that issue. But I hope that it's important to both parties that we don't go through this whole mess again.\\n\\nFADEL: Now, you said you're speaking with us from the Munich Security Conference, attending in your capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What's your reaction to the announcement of the agreement with the Taliban for a reduction of violence, just shifting for a moment?\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, what we have been doing over the last two decades has not worked. And so I think it's worthwhile to take a chance on a political deal in which the Taliban makes commitments about keeping al-Qaida, the group that attacked the United States, out of that country in exchange for a drawdown of American forces.\\n\\nObviously, the missing element right now is any agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government. But I think we have to, you know, all admit, both parties, that what we have been doing has not worked. The Taliban is growing stronger. Corruption isn't getting better. And so I have been generally supportive of President Trump's efforts to try to get a political deal here. I'll wait to see the details of this one. But it looks to be along the lines of something that I've been calling for for a while.\\n\\nFADEL: That's Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut.\\n\\nThanks for joining us.\\n\\nMURPHY: Thank you.\\n\\nFADEL: Later in the program, we'll hear more from the Munich Security Conference.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Agrees To Honor 'One China' Policy In Call With Xi Jinping\\n\\nThe White House says President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, and agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our 'One China' policy. NPR's Robert Siegel talks to Dan Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute about what that means for U.S. relations with China and Taiwan.\\n\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\n\\nThe White House says President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday and said the U.S. will honor the so-called One China policy under which the U.S. recognizes just one China and says Taiwan is part of it. China considers Taiwan a province. There were questions about whether Trump would keep that policy. Back in December, he broke with decades of protocol by taking a phone call from the president of Taiwan. And here's what he told Fox News at that time.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want China dictating to me. And this was a call put into me. I didn't make the call. And it was a call - very short call saying, congratulations, sir, on the victory. It was a very nice call - short. And why should some other nation be able to say I can't take a call? I think it actually would have been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, not taking it.\\n\\nSIEGEL: So how should we interpret the administration's new-found commitment to One China? We're going to put that to Dan Blumenthal. He's director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. That's a conservative Washington think tank. Welcome.\\n\\nDAN BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much, Bob.\\n\\nSIEGEL: And do you see this move by the Trump administration as a reversal?\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: I don't. They never said they were going to break from the One China policy. I've always said you can have good relations with Taiwan at the highest levels and with China under the One China policy framework.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Well, do you think that this report of the phone conversation between Trump and Xi signals that perhaps the Trump administration will be less hard line with China than his earlier comments might have suggested - on trade, for example?\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Well, I think it's part of a strategic calculation. So you have to look at the entire picture. Secretary Mattis had a very good trip out to Asia meeting with South Koreans. And the Japanese Prime Minister Abe is, of course, here. Taiwan was fully informed about the telephone call with Xi before it happened. So you have to look at it from that perspective that we're going to have very strong relations - the strongest relations with our allies and friends, but we're going to have stable and cooperative relations with China also.\\n\\nSIEGEL: There's a line in the official White House statement about Trump's call with President Xi. It says that Trump agreed to honor One China. This is a quote, at the request of President Xi. What do you make of that? Is that a sign that China is dictating or demanding terms or that One China isn't a priority for the U.S.? It only came up because Xi asked for it.\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Well, I would interpret it as every time anyone meets with a Chinese leader or a Chinese government official, the first thing they ask for before you even have tea or coffee is...\\n\\nSIEGEL: (Laughter) How many Chinas are there?\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Exactly. So I think that that's pretty standard for Xi Jinping.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Think it would have played badly for Xi back home if he had had a conversation and a positive statement about the One China policy did not come out of it?\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: That's exactly right. And Xi is in a lot more trouble at home than people realize. And he's feeling the pressure at home because of a stagnant economy. And he's feeling the pressure all around him because of U.S. tight relations with the alliances.\\n\\nSIEGEL: So where we stand on the One China policy now is - it's important to China, obviously, that everyone say that there's one China, and Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. - it seems now, Donald Trump, after having raised doubts about the need to say that, now says that's true. What about Taiwan? Are they happy with the status quo?\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: The status quo is very difficult to define because China tries to change the status quo all the time. It's not happy with the fact that Taiwan has this de facto independence. And so China tries to change that. So Taiwan is relatively happy. But it'd like to see us push a little more so it gets more international space - free trade agreements, participation in international institutions, more military exchanges with us - so not completely satisfied.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Stan (ph) Blumenthal director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Thanks for talking with us.\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much, Bob.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF AMON TOBIN SONG, EASY MUFFIN)\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Was Your Seafood Caught With Slave Labor? New Database Helps Retailers Combat Abuse\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paula Bronstein/Getty Images Paula Bronstein/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program, known best for its red, yellow and green sustainable seafood-rating scheme, is unveiling its first Seafood Slavery Risk Tool on Thursday. It's a database designed to help corporate seafood buyers assess the risk of forced labor, human trafficking and hazardous child labor in the seafood they purchase.\\n\\nThe tool's release comes on the heels of a new report that confirms forced labor and human rights abuses remain embedded in Thailand's fishing industry, years after global media outlets first documented the practice.\\n\\nThe 134-page report by Human Rights Watch shows horrific conditions continue. That's despite promises from the Thai government to crack down on abuses suffered by mostly migrants from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia — and despite pressure from the U.S. and European countries that purchase much of Thailand's seafood exports. (Thailand is the fourth-largest seafood exporter in the world).\\n\\nFor U.S. retailers and seafood importers, ferreting slavery out of the supply chain has proved exceedingly difficult. Fishing occurs far from shore, often out of sight, while exploitation and abuse on vessels stem from very complex social and economic dynamics.\\n\\nCompanies didn't know how to navigate solving the problem, says Sara McDonald, Seafood Watch project manager for the Slavery Risk Tool.\\n\\nThe new Seafood Watch database, which took two years to design, assigns slavery risk ratings to specific fisheries and was developed in collaboration with Liberty Asia and the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership. Like Seafood Watch's color-coded ratings, the Seafood Slavery Risk Tool aims to keep it simple — a set criteria determines whether a fishery will earn a critical, high, moderate or low risk rating.\\n\\nA critical risk rating, for example, means credible evidence of forced labor or child labor has been found within the fishery itself. Albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna caught by the Taiwanese fleet gets a critical risk rating. A low risk fishery, like Patagonian toothfish in Chile (also known as Chilean seabass), is one with good regulatory protections and enforcement, with no evidence of abuses in related industries.\\n\\nUntil recently, environmental concerns dominated most of the conversation around sustainable seafood. Issues like overfishing, mangrove destruction, pollution and illegal fishing determined whether a seafood item was deemed one to enjoy or avoid.\\n\\nBut when reports began to surface in 2014 and 2015 that seafood harvested or processed by forced labor was making it into the supply chains of major U.S. retailers like Walmart, Kroger, Safeway and restaurants like Red Lobster, corporations were quick to make public commitments and include stronger language in their supplier guidelines in hopes of addressing the problem. Delivering on those promises, however, has proved harder. Traceability alone hasn't been enough. Until now, retailers have had few tools to make it easier to identify which fisheries are actually at higher risk for human rights abuses.\\n\\nIt's a lament heard by Seafood Watch and others.\\n\\nThe companies knew their supply chains weren't transparent. They were obviously embarrassed and humiliated by being called out, says Duncan Jepson, founder of Liberty Asia, a nongovernmental organization that focuses on preventing human trafficking. He adds that the incentive for businesses to use the new Seafood Watch tool is obvious. From our perspective, the question now is, do you want to be involved or exposed to people earning their profits from these types of environments?\\n\\nMaisie Ganzler is chief strategy and brand officer at Bon Appétit Management Company and oversees the food service company's supply chain and purchasing standards. She says it's difficult for any company to get assurances that the product it's buying was produced without slave labor. Distance, language and cultural barriers, murky supply chains where seafood changes hands multiple times — all make the problem harder. She says America's country-of-origin labeling system, which labels where a tuna is canned but not where it is caught, also muddies the waters.\\n\\nAnd then you have the high prevalence of fraud, and I don't mean species fraud, says Ganzler. If you're willing to enslave another human being or throw a worker overboard, are you willing to also falsify the papers that come with the fish? Probably. These are the most hidden issues in the farthest reaches of the world. It's super hard.\\n\\nMcDonald of Seafood Watch says the data behind the new risk tool come from reliable government and media reports of known abuses; incidences of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; the number of days a fishing vessel is at sea; and more. The tool also considers other indicators, like whether there is evidence of forced labor, human trafficking and child labor in a country's other sectors — such as forestry, agriculture and aquaculture. That increases the likelihood that these abuses could be happening in fisheries as well, she says.\\n\\nUnlike the aquarium's Seafood Watch app, the new Seafood Slavery Risk tool will not advise retailers to purchase one species over another. Instead, we say: stay, engage and create change in the industry by working with suppliers to change their practices, says McDonald. With Seafood Watch, we have a lot of advice on what to purchase and what not, but it's very different with human rights abuses. If you boycott or avoid or stop purchasing, it drives it underground. Every human rights expert we talked with says you can't boycott, you have to keep it out in the sunshine. That's the only way to make a difference.\\n\\nBut many retailers are already skittish about talking openly about slavery in the seafood industry, and it's unclear how they'll address these issues with their own customers. Kroger, Safeway, Whole Foods, Hy-Vee, Walmart and Red Lobster did not respond or declined our requests for an interview for this story.\\n\\nNo retailer is going to go out and talk much about the fact that there are labor rights issues in the supply chain, but it's critical that retailers stay in the game and continue to be involved, says Dick Jones, CEO of Ocean Outcomes, an international NGO focused on improving fisheries and fish farms in Northeast Asia. He likens it to the routine testing that retailers do for E. coli in ground beef. They don't tell their customers there's a risk. They just do it because it's the right thing to do, he says.\\n\\nOther groups are also working on tools to help businesses avoid human rights abuses in their supply chains. The Slavery and Trafficking Risk Template is an open-source project by the Social Responsibility Alliance to help companies build socially responsible supply chains. Labor Safe Screen, developed by the Sustainability Incubator, is focused specifically on seafood products.\\n\\nThe reality is that no company right now can be 100 percent sure there's no slavery in the supply chain, says Ganzler. All companies need to band together to work on the issue, along with the government. It really is an issue that governments are going to have to take action on.\\n\\nClare Leschin-Hoar is a journalist based in San Diego who covers food policy and sustainability issues.\\n\\nThis story was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN), a nonprofit investigative journalism organization."}
{"original": "U.Va. Students Investigate Their Yearbook's Racist History — Starting With Its Title\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Abby Clukey Courtesy of Abby Clukey\\n\\nAfter hearing about the recent discovery of a racist photo on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook page, student journalists at the University of Virginia started combing through their school's old yearbooks.\\n\\nWhat they found was horrifying.\\n\\nA 1971 class member page for the Chi Psi fraternity depicts a mob of black-hooded students carrying rifles, all their gazes fixed upon a lone, black-faced mannequin swinging from a tree.\\n\\nIt looks like a staged lynching, as Nik Popli, an editor of the university's newspaper, The Cavalier Daily, noted on Twitter.\\n\\nThere were other examples of racist images, mainly blackface, throughout U.Va. yearbooks from the 60s, 70s and 80s, said student journalist Abby Clukey, who is the managing editor of The Cavalier Daily. But U.Va. isn't the only school to find racist images — like blackface and KKK costumes — in their past.\\n\\nStudents and faculty across other campuses in the state have discovered similar pictures, and a recent poll from The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University found that 11 percent of Virginians have either worn blackface or know someone who has.\\n\\nBlackface was a common pastime in 19th-century minstrel shows. Non-black performers would blacken their skin with burnt cork or dye to portray a caricature of a black person. The practice perpetuated a lasting, racist narrative that painted black people as inferior and contributed to their continued mistreatment.\\n\\nIn investigating past yearbooks, U.Va. students are reckoning with the racist history not only of their state, but also of their campus. Founded by Thomas Jefferson, who owned hundreds of slaves, U.Va. was built on slave labor. Starting in 1830, the university used enslaved people from the surrounding area to work on campus.\\n\\nOn that same campus, the Charlottesville white supremacist rally turned deadly in 2017. On that same campus, two fraternities were suspended in 2002 after a party where students showed up in blackface.\\n\\nIt turns out even the very name of U.Va.'s yearbook, Corks and Curls, has been identified as minstrel slang for the burned cork used to blacken faces and the curly Afro wigs used in blackface costumes.\\n\\nIt really just goes to show that we need to be addressing our history and our really complicated past, Clukey told NPR's Michel Martin. That's also the sentiment among people I interviewed — we have to be acknowledging the harm that the university has done to the community.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Abby Clukey Courtesy of Abby Clukey\\n\\nThe yearbook was first published in 1888, but the name hasn't been changed since. Soon after the yearbook launched, Clukey said that there was a contest to rationalize the name of the yearbook.\\n\\nThe winning submission suggested corks were unprepared freshmen, bottled up and too frightened to speak in class, while curls referred to students who did so well that they were patted on the head and curleth his tail for delight.\\n\\nThe yearbook folded in 2008 due to inadequate finances, since not enough students were buying it, but around two years ago U.Va.'s alumni association helped revive Corks and Curls through fundraising. This year's yearbook committee is still planning to publish a 2019 issue, according to Clukey, but have had conversations about changing the name.\\n\\nAfter finding the photo of the staged lynching, The Cavalier Daily posted it on Twitter, where it garnered a lot of disgusted reactions. Clukey has been interviewing students about their reactions and found that the racist photos have had lasting hurt. One student of color she interviewed had just bought his graduation gown.\\n\\nIn that picture that we posted, it looked like they're wearing graduation gowns or something with hoods, Clukey said. So that reminded him of what he was about to be doing — graduating from this school that is deeply rooted in racism."}
{"original": "A Week Of Policy Reversals For Trump\\n\\nAs the Trump administration looks for legislative and policy wins, the president is publicly reversing positions on issues as varied as Syria and health care.\\n\\nLINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:\\n\\nThis is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. Scott Simon is off for a couple of weeks. I'm Linda Wertheimer. President Trump is celebrating Easter this weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort. He traveled to Florida with far fewer senior aides than usual. Those aides are likely scrambling to account for a number of significant policy changes the president made public this week. NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson is keeping a tally, and she joins us now. Good morning, Mara.\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Linda.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: We're seeing an extraordinary moment in Donald Trump's presidency - already anything but ordinary. He's not just adjusting positions. He's out and out flipping. I count at least half a dozen major reversals this week.\\n\\nLIASSON: There's a very long list. NATO was obsolete. Now it's not obsolete. China was manipulating its currency. Now it doesn't manipulate its currency. The Export-Import Bank was crony capitalism. Now it's important to small businesses. President Obama wasn't transparent enough. Now Donald Trump has reversed the Obama policy and has decided to keep the White House visitor logs secret. So the list goes on and on. Now, all presidents change their positions when they come into office. This is kind of like reality television without the television. But even though Donald Trump trumpets his flexibility as an important part of his leadership style, this is really policy whiplash.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: Let's take a look at health care. Donald Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare immediately. His effort to do that with the American Health Care Act crashed last month, and now they're thinking about taking another run at it. What has changed?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, that's a tactical shift. You know, he said he was going to move on to tax reform. Now, he's back to wanting to do health care first, and his new negotiating stance is to threaten to stop the subsidies to insurance companies that keep the individual market going. He wants to hold those subsidies hostage so that, as he puts it, the Democrats will come running to him, begging for negotiations because he couldn't get enough Republican votes, he has to turn to Democrats. So far, Democrats aren't biting on that. And a coalition of business interests, including the chamber of commerce, has written to Trump saying please don't stop those subsidies.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: Could there be real harm to Donald Trump's presidency here if he's so inconsistent on everything from NATO to the Ex-Im Bank and on and on?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, that's a good question. The question is, would he lose his base that found his America First economic populism so appealing? I think so far no, as long as he stays very tough on immigration, which he is - he's assembling a deportation force - and on social issues, like his executive order making it easier to defund Planned Parenthood, or guns. He's going to be speaking to a big NRA meeting at the end of the month. I think what's potentially more harmful for him is if he can't pass anything or if he gets involved in a foreign entanglement that people don't like. For the most part, the slippage in the polls for him is coming from people who didn't expect the Trump administration to be so chaotic and ineffective. And, you know, the new chairman of the Republican Party, Ronna Romney, has even warned Republicans that they could lose in 2018 if they don't start passing legislation and acting like a governing party.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: So is there some deeper meaning in all these policy changes? Is this a new or different Donald Trump, or is the real Donald Trump or what is it?\\n\\nLIASSON: I think it's two things. There's confusion and incoherence, but there is something happening if you're trying to read the tea leaves on who's getting the upper hand inside the White House in terms of defining what Trumpism is. We would have to say you're seeing the globalists, the New York Wall Street wing of the Trump White House ascendant. You're seeing the economic populist nationalist Steve Bannon wing losing influence. Maybe the Trump administration is morphing into a xenophobic version of what Mitt Romney administration would have been like. He has - still has a hard-line conservative stance on immigration, abortion, guns, climate change, but the economic policy is getting more globalist and less nationalist.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: That's NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson.

{"original": "Hospitals Forced To Be More Transparent About Pricing. Will That Save You Money?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption FS Productions/Tetra images RF/Getty Images FS Productions/Tetra images RF/Getty Images\\n\\nHospitals are facing the new year with new requirements to post price information they have long sought to obscure: the actual prices they negotiate with insurers and the discounts they offer their cash-paying customers.\\n\\nThe move is part of a larger push by the Trump administration to use price transparency to curtail prices and create better-informed consumers. Yet there is disagreement on whether posting the prices for hospital services and procedures will actually achieve that goal.\\n\\nAs of Jan. 1, the facilities must post on their websites prices for every service, drug and supply they provide. Next year, under a separate rule, health insurers must take similar steps. A related effort to force drugmakers to list their prices in advertisements was struck down by the courts.\\n\\nWith the new hospital rule, consumers should be able to see the tremendous variation in prices for the exact same care among hospitals and get an estimate of what they will be charged for care — before they seek it.\\n\\nThe new data requirements go well beyond the previous rule of requiring hospitals to post their chargemasters — the hospital-generated list prices that bear little relation to what it costs a hospital to provide care. Also, few consumers or insurers actually pay those listed prices.\\n\\nInstead, under the new rule put forward by the Trump administration, these are the real prices in health care, says Cynthia Fisher, founder and chairman of Patient Rights Advocate, a group that promotes price transparency.\\n\\nHere's what consumers should know:\\n\\nHow will this work?\\n\\nEach hospital must post publicly online — and in a machine-readable format that is easy to process by computers — several prices for every item and service they provide: gross charges; the actual, and most likely far lower, prices they've negotiated with insurers, including de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges; and the cash price they offer patients who are uninsured or not using their insurance.\\n\\nIn addition, each hospital must also post, in a consumer-friendly format, the specific costs for 300 common and shoppable services, such as having a baby, getting a joint replacement, having a hernia repaired or undergoing a diagnostic brain scan.\\n\\nThose 300 bundles of procedures and services must total all costs involved — from the hardware used to the operating room time, to drugs given and the fees of hospital-employed physicians — so patients won't have to attempt the nearly impossible job of figuring it out themselves.\\n\\nHospitals can mostly select which services fall into this category, although the federal government has dictated 70 that must be listed — including certain surgeries, diagnostic tests, imaging scans, new patient visits and psychotherapy sessions.\\n\\nWill prices be exact?\\n\\nNo. At best, these are ballpark figures.\\n\\nOther factors influence consumers' costs, like the type of insurance plan a patient has, the size and remaining amount of the annual deductible on their health plan, and the complexity of their medical problem.\\n\\nAn estimate on a surgery, for example, might prove inexact. If all goes as expected, the price quoted likely will be close. But unexpected complications could arise, adding to the cost.\\n\\nYou'll get the average price, but you are not average, says Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies hospital pricing.\\n\\nTools to help consumers determine in advance the amount of deductible they'll owe are already available from many insurers. And experts expect the additional information being made available this month will prompt entrepreneurs to create their own apps or services to help consumers analyze the price data.\\n\\nFor now, though, the hospital requirements are a worthy start, say specialists in U.S. health care costs.\\n\\nIt's very good news for consumers, said George Nation, a professor of law and business at Lehigh University who studies hospital pricing. Individuals will be able to get price information, although how much they are going to use it will remain to be seen.\\n\\nWho else will use this information?\\n\\nZack Cooper, an associate professor of public health and economics at Yale, doubts that the data alone will make much of a difference for most consumers.\\n\\nIt's not likely that my neighbor — or me, for that matter — will go on and look at prices and, therefore, dramatically change decisions about where to get care, Cooper says.\\n\\nSome cost information is already made available by insurers to their enrollees, particularly out-of-pocket costs for elective services, but most people don't consult it, he says.\\n\\nThat could be because many consumers carry types of insurance in which they pay flat-dollar copayments for such things as doctor visits, drugs or hospital stays — payments that have no correlation to the underlying charges.\\n\\nStill, the information may be of great interest to the uninsured and to the increasing number of Americans with high-deductible plans, in which they are responsible for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in costs annually before the insurer begins picking up the bulk of the cost.\\n\\nFor them, the negotiated rate and cash discount information may prove more useful, Nation says.\\n\\nIf I have a $10,000 deductible plan and it's December and I'm not close to meeting that, I may go to a hospital and try to get the cash price, Nation says.\\n\\nEmployers, however, may have a keen interest in the new data, says James Gelfand, senior vice president at the ERISA Industry Committee, which lobbies on behalf of large employers that offer health insurance to their workers. Employers will want to know how much they are paying each hospital compared with others in the area and how well their insurers stack up in negotiating rates, Gelfand says.\\n\\nFor some employers, he says, it could be eye-opening to see how hospitals cross-subsidize by charging exorbitant amounts for some things and minimal amounts for others.\\n\\nThe rule puts that all into the light, says Gelfand. When an employer sees these ridiculous prices, for the first time they will have the ability to say no. That could mean rejecting specific prices or the hospital entirely.\\n\\nTypically, employers can't or won't limit workers' choices by outright cutting a hospital from an insurance network. More likely, they may use the information to create financial incentives to use the lowest-cost facilities, says Anderson at Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nIf I'm an employer, he says, I'll look at three hospitals in my area and say, 'I'll pay the price for the lowest one. If you want to go to one of the other two, you can pay the difference.' \\n\\nWill price transparency reduce overall health spending?\\n\\nRevealing actual negotiated prices, as this rule requires, may push the more expensive hospitals in an area to reduce prices in their future bargaining talks with insurers or employers, potentially lowering health spending in those regions.\\n\\nIt could also go the other way, with lower-cost hospitals demanding a raise, driving up spending.\\n\\nBottom line: Price transparency can help, but the market power of the various players might matter more.\\n\\nIn some places, where there may be one dominant hospital, even employers who know they are getting ripped off may not feel they can cut out a big, brand-name facility from their networks, no matter the price, Anderson says.\\n\\nIs the rule change a done deal?\\n\\nThe hospital industry went to court, arguing that parts of the rule go too far, violating their First Amendment rights and also unfairly forcing hospitals to disclose trade secrets. That information, the industry says, can then be used against them in negotiations with insurers and employers.\\n\\nBut the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed with the hospitals and upheld the rule, prompting an appeal by the industry. On Dec. 29, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed that lower court decision and did not move to block enforcement of the rule.\\n\\nIn a written statement last week, the American Hospital Association's general counsel cited disappointment with the ruling, and said the organization is reviewing the decision carefully to determine next steps.\\n\\nApart from the litigation, the AHA says it plans to talk with the incoming Biden administration to try to persuade them there are some elements to this rule and the insurer rule that are tricky, says Tom Nickels, an executive vice president of the trade group. We want to be of help to consumers, but is it really in people's best interest to provide privately negotiated rates?\\n\\nFisher thinks so: Hospitals are fighting this because they want to keep their negotiated deals with insurers secret, she says. What these rules do is give the American consumer the power of being informed.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."}
{"original": "Trump Regulator's Rule Would Force Banks To Lend To Gun-Makers And Oil Drillers\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/AP\\n\\nThe Trump administration is trying to push through a last-minute rule that could force banks to offer loans to gun-makers and oil exploration companies or to finance high-cost payday lenders.\\n\\nThe move follows announcements by the biggest U.S. banks that there are some industries and activities they don't want to finance, such as drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or making loans to gun manufacturers who make assault-style weapons. Some major banks have sworn off making those loans.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, a Trump-appointed banking regulator is pushing for a rule that considers that an unfair, discriminatory practice.\\n\\nIt's a very poorly constructed rule, says John Court, the head of regulatory affairs at the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the biggest banks in the country. He says the rule is clearly hastily conceived and hastily constructed.\\n\\nThe rule was proposed in November after President Trump lost his reelection bid. And Court says it appears that the Trump-appointed acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is scrambling to enact it before the Biden administration begins next week.\\n\\nCourt says many financial firms are getting more focused on environmental, social, and governance — or ESG — issues.\\n\\nAmong those are racial equality, climate, other issues, Court says. And this proposal clearly would undercut the ability of a banking organization to achieve or administer any so-called ESG goals that it might have.\\n\\nThe rule is based on the concept of fair access to credit, which traditionally had to do with preventing racial discrimination.\\n\\nThe OCC declined an interview. Acting head Brian Brooks said in a press release that fair access to financial services, credit, and capital are essential to our economy.\\n\\nBut critics say the rule is really about forcing banks to finance firearms companies that make assault-style rifles, or even predatory payday lenders that charge 300% in annual interest.\\n\\nPayday lenders not only disproportionately harm people of color, they target communities of color, says Rebecca Borné, a lawyer with the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending.\\n\\nSo the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language. says Borné. The result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, cloaking it in this language of civil rights.\\n\\nThe main trade group for payday lenders, INFiN, said in a statement that it supports steps by the OCC to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule.\\n\\nIf the Trump administration finalizes the rule before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Court says that would make it harder, but not impossible, for the new administration to undo it. And he says if it comes to it, banks would likely sue to try to stop the rule.\\n\\nIt's removing the ability to make decisions, it's removing that from the bank and effectively vesting it in a government mandate, he says.\\n\\nAnd Court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society — whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else.\\n\\nThe rule could also be scrapped by Congress through an oversight tool called the Congressional Review Act, especially since Democrats will now control both the House and the Senate."}
{"original": "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nSHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, HOST:\\n\\nYou're listening to CODE SWITCH. I'm Shereen Marisol Meraji.\\n\\nGENE DEMBY, HOST:\\n\\nAnd I'm Gene Demby.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nRALPH NORTHAM: My fellow Virginians, earlier today, I released a statement apologizing for behavior in my past.\\n\\nMERAJI: This episode starts with a yearbook photo...\\n\\nDEMBY: So y'all already know where this is going.\\n\\nMERAJI: ...A photo from the 1984 med school yearbook of Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia. And on Northam's page, there is a picture of two men, one wearing the full Klu Klux Klan get-up and the other one wearing a wig and blackface.\\n\\nDEMBY: At first, Northam apologized for the photos on his page in a brief statement.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nNORTHAM: I cannot change the decisions I made, nor can I undo the harm my behavior caused then and today.\\n\\nMERAJI: But the next day, he went full Shaggy defense.\\n\\nDEMBY: It wasn't me.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nNORTHAM: I'm telling the truth today. That was not my picture in the photo.\\n\\nDEMBY: Uh-huh.\\n\\nHe did admit to wearing blackface another time as a young man, when he dressed up and danced like Michael Jackson for a party. When a reporter asked Northam if he could still do the moonwalk, his wife suggested to him that that press conference was probably not the appropriate time for him to bust out a moonwalk.\\n\\nMERAJI: So far, no resignation for Governor Northam - he's been meeting with black civil rights leaders. He's busy doing that. He's hoping to save his governorship. Meanwhile, people on both sides of the aisle want him out, and he's not the only Virginia official in dire straits.\\n\\nDEMBY: Nope (laughter).\\n\\nMERAJI: The lieutenant governor, the next in line for the governorship, he's facing sexual assault allegations. And the official next in line after him is now dealing with his own blackface scandal.\\n\\nDEMBY: (Sighing) Virginia, it's for lovers. It's for lovers. It's blackface Christmas, Shereen, and it's not even October yet...\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter).\\n\\nDEMBY: ...Not even close to Halloween.\\n\\nBut we're not going to talk about blackface again. For more on that, you can search the CODE SWITCH blog. Instead, we want to focus on something Northam said in his apology. At his press conference, he said that he hoped his political crisis could start a dialogue.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nNORTHAM: I believe this moment can be the first small step to open a discussion about these difficult issues and how they contribute to the greater racism and discrimination that defines so much of our history.\\n\\nMERAJI: And he's not the only person trying to kick-start a race conversation this week. There was the actor Liam Neeson, who's facing a backlash after he said he was looking for a black man to attack and kill to avenge a friend who was allegedly raped by a black man. He's asking for racial dialogue.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nLIAM NEESON: To talk, to open up, to talk about these things, you know? We all pretend we're kind of, you know, politically correct. I mean, in this country - it's the same in my own country, too - you sometimes just scratch the surface, and you discover this racism.\\n\\nMERAJI: It seems like calls for racial dialogue are a part of the life cycle of every controversy or crisis in the news these days that have to do with race.\\n\\nDEMBY: Yep.\\n\\nCYNTHIA TUCKER: I'm Cynthia Tucker. I'm a syndicated columnist. I have been in journalism nearly 40 years.\\n\\nMERAJI: That is why you're here.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTUCKER: Some perspective.\\n\\nMERAJI: Exactly. We need that. Would you mind recounting for me the number of times you've covered, in your 40-year career in journalism, calls for racial dialogue?\\n\\nTUCKER: You know, I've lost track of the number of times that a white politician - it is almost always a white politician who calls for a national dialogue on race.\\n\\nMERAJI: Now, when it comes to the Governor Northam blackface incident and his call for racial dialogue, Cynthia Tucker told me that it is not black people's job to explain to Governor Northam - or any other white people, for that matter - that blackface is wrong and racist.\\n\\nTUCKER: I don't have that much faith in national dialogues on anything, especially race. He is calling for it in order to deflect attention from the calls for his resignation, to salvage his political career. Nothing would be accomplished.\\n\\nDEMBY: So can anything really be accomplished from these national racial dialogues?\\n\\nMERAJI: That's why I got in touch with Cynthia - because she's not only covered a bunch of these calls for racial dialogues over the years, she participated in one very high-profile attempt 20 years ago.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBILL CLINTON: Over the coming year, I want to lead the American people in a great and unprecedented conversation about race. We have talked at each other and about each other for a long time. It's high time we all began talking with each other.\\n\\nMERAJI: GD, do you recognize that voice?\\n\\nDEMBY: That sounds like one William Jefferson Clinton.\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter) That's right - No. 42. It was halfway through the first year of his second term. He's giving the commencement address at UC San Diego. It's a beautiful sunny day in June of 1997.\\n\\nDEMBY: Wait. Wait. They're all beautiful sunny days in San Diego. Come on.\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter) That's true. It was another beautiful sunny day in San Diego.\\n\\nDEMBY: There you go.\\n\\nMERAJI: And he announces the start of his national conversation on race in American.\\n\\nDEMBY: I kind of - I don't remember this at all. So wait. What prompted this particular...\\n\\nMERAJI: You were old enough to remember this, by the way.\\n\\nDEMBY: Listen. Are you trying to...\\n\\nMERAJI: Were you not paying attention to the news?\\n\\nDEMBY: ...Put my business in the streets?\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter).\\n\\nDEMBY: So Shereen, what prompted this particular white politician to call for a national dialogue on race?\\n\\nMERAJI: I'm not quite sure, and I asked a bunch of people that. There was a lot going on racewise in the '90s, as I know you know.\\n\\nDEMBY: Yes.\\n\\nMERAJI: There was the civil unrest here in LA after the Rodney King verdict, the O.J. Simpson trial. And you know, President Clinton had his own personal race controversies.\\n\\nDEMBY: Right. You had Sister Souljah, Ricky Ray Rector, which was a big deal. Google those if you don't know it.\\n\\nMERAJI: But President Clinton said this national conversation about race had to do with the rapid demographic shifts that were on the horizon. We were talking about America getting browner way back in 1997. Yes, it's true.\\n\\nDEMBY: Yep.\\n\\nMERAJI: And President Clinton wanted us to, you know, discuss our ethnic and racial differences and have a, quote, honest dialogue.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nJIM LEHRER: Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. Welcome to an hour of conversation with President Clinton about race in America.\\n\\nWelcome to you, Mr. President.\\n\\nCLINTON: Thank you, Jim.\\n\\nLEHRER: The president's conversation will be with eight Americans, four NewsHour regulars...\\n\\nMERAJI: Cynthia was one of those NewsHour regulars.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nLEHRER: Regional commentator Cynthia Tucker of The Atlanta Constitution.\\n\\nMERAJI: There was a mix of people of color on the panel, both liberal and conservative.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nLEHRER: Elaine Chao, former head of United Way of America, now at The Heritage Foundation\\n\\nMERAJI: That's the Elaine Chao who today is the secretary of transportation for the Trump administration. She's married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. You may know her.\\n\\nDEMBY: I remember reading recently that her boss and her husband do not like each other.\\n\\nMERAJI: I also read that New York Times Magazine piece.\\n\\nDEMBY: Yes (laughter).\\n\\nMERAJI: Anyway, on this NewsHour panel with President Clinton talking about race in America, she took a very familiar conservative stance on affirmative action.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nELAINE CHAO: If you are Asian-American, you have the toughest standard to meet. And of course, other races have other standards as well. That is a horrible example of preferential treatment and of unfair treatment based on race, and I think something's got to be done about that.\\n\\nMERAJI: Everyone on the panel had a few minutes each to talk to President Clinton and one another about what they thought this country's big race issues were. And here's what Cynthia Tucker had to say.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nTUCKER: More Americans need a stronger sense of history. I think there has to be an acknowledgment that African-Americans and Native Americans especially have suffered burdens others have not.\\n\\nMERAJI: There were two African-American women on that panel, two Latino men, one Asian woman, one Native American man, one Jewish man and one black man.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nCLARENCE PAGE: In 1998, we are still a segregated society. Blacks and whites still live mostly separate lives.\\n\\nMERAJI: That's Clarence Page.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, PBS NEWSHOUR)\\n\\nLEHRER: Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune.\\n\\nMERAJI: He was talking on the panel about housing segregation and school segregation.\\n\\nDEMBY: Evergreen topics for us.\\n\\nMERAJI: Yes, deja vu much? He also argued the benefits of affirmative action on the panel. And I reached out to him, too. He's still a syndicated columnist with the Chicago Tribune, and he's on its editorial board.\\n\\nPAGE: I thought we had a lot to share - and so did the rest of the panel members - over a range of topics.\\n\\nMERAJI: I want to read you something from one of your columns. And this was in July 1998. It was after you were on the NewsHour.\\n\\nPAGE: Right.\\n\\nMERAJI: You said, (reading) of course we were just getting warmed up. If you really want to have a productive dialogue on race, you need more than an hour. And you don't need a panel made up of educated elites. You need to mix it up with blue-collar homeowners from urban and suburban bungalows who fear racial change or view Native American rights as a threat to their property values. You need store clerks who tense up whenever young black or Latino males walk into the door. You need some young black and Latino honor students who tense up whenever they see a cop.\\n\\nThen you need at least a weekend, preferably isolated in some cabin in the woods, where the screaming won't disturb the neighbors. And then you spend the first day getting to know each other well enough to get past the social niceties and political correctness and get down to some really frank gripes.\\n\\nPAGE: Wow.\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter).\\n\\nPAGE: That's brilliant. Who wrote that? I think - it helps all of us to be able to get out there and listen to folks who come from different experiences than our own. That's how a dialogue gets started. But it may not be - get really honest maybe until the second or third day. Then you can begin to start talking about what do we do about it, and then you can put together the beginnings of an action plan. And talking also leads toward - it leads in the direction of empathy and understanding, and you've got to have that to really have permanent stability.\\n\\nSo I think that as cynical as we can be and sarcastic as we can be about, oh, here's another call for dialogue - I think it's still worth it. Or at least it's better to call for dialogue than to call for something more problematic and divisive. That's the recipe some people have for a better America. I don't think it's going to work.\\n\\nMERAJI: Do you think the governor should resign?\\n\\nPAGE: (Laughter) If I don't say I think he ought to resign, then I will be isolating myself from 90 percent of humanity, it seems, these days. After covering so many of these episodes of bad racial etiquette, I have maintained that our real problem here is the punitive nature of our response to these episodes. We tend to over-punish, and this creates anger and people becoming more divided and charges and countercharges of political correctness and censorship and blah, blah, blah, whereas quite often, it's just simply a difference in the way we grow up - that, you know, I grew up in a predominately black community; some other person grows up in a predominately white community. They're going to have a different set of customs and points of view than I do.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, I would like for these episodes to be teaching moments or teachable moments, as they say. So if they go and commit the same offense or a very similar one later on, you've got a little more perspective as to whether they are a, like, serial offender or just a one-timer.\\n\\nMERAJI: Well, Governor Northam did call for racial dialogue. I mean...\\n\\nPAGE: Yeah.\\n\\nMERAJI: ...He did sort of allude to what you're saying here - that he didn't realize it was so offensive and that we need to learn more about each other and what offends us and what doesn't offend us.\\n\\nPAGE: Everybody agrees we ought to have racial dialogue - just ask them (laughter) - just like everybody agrees that they are personally not racist. You know, we need dialogue. But how do you do it? How do you have an honest dialogue? A lot of people who call for dialogue aren't really ready for honest dialogue, which means that you can't be sitting there worried about being offended every second. You need to really hash these things out.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nMERAJI: So we talked for a while. And what I heard from Clarence Page is that, yes, racial dialogue is important. But it's something that should be done locally to work best, not on a broad national scale, and that people must be committed to being completely honest, committed to listening and participating - even when they're very offended.\\n\\nDEMBY: So OK. It seems like one of the problems with having racial dialogue - I'm doing racial dialogue in air quotes - is that it's, like, wrapped up in this other argument that Clarence Page was making - right? - that we live in a segregated society. So because of white supremacy, we have all of these institutions and communities that were deliberately separate. Right? And so we don't even have spaces where this dialogue can live and, I guess, like, accumulate. You know what I mean?\\n\\nLike, you can have a conversation in a cabin out in the woods, as Clarence said. But what really needs to happen is that you interact with people who you are, like, trying to, like, live in community with. Right? Like, you need that to happen in a PTA meeting or a community meeting, but those PTA meetings don't exist because our schools are segregated. You know what I mean? There's no neighborhoods where people have to come up with rules around how to live with each other - not just talk to each other in these one-off conversations but, like, live with each other. Right? So these dialogues feel like this diffuse thing that lives out in the ether. It's not tethered to how people are living day to day.\\n\\nAnd also, as our play cousin and former CODE SWITCH editor Keith Woods said when we talked about, like, how to have a conversation like this in the school, people tend to think that conversations about race are honorable unto themselves - like, that just because you had them, you've done the good thing no matter how terrible those conversations might have turned out to have been. Obviously, that ain't it either.\\n\\nI mean, Shereen, what do you make of what Clarence is saying here?\\n\\nMERAJI: I tend toward wanting to have these types of conversations more than not wanting to have them. But I also feel like we need to be prepared with the same kind of information. And that's actually where Cynthia Tucker comes in. She, like you, is very skeptical of these big calls for national dialogues on race. And you know, to make her point, she goes back to that 1998 roundtable with President Clinton.\\n\\nTUCKER: We discussed the same things that people who were genuinely interested in racial and ethnic progress in the country have been discussing for 50 years. We talked about changing demographics. We talked about race and poverty. We talked about how so many whites don't seem to have a sense of the history of race in this country.\\n\\nMERAJI: I definitely watched that and thought - oh, man, I can't believe we're literally talking about the same exact things 20 years later.\\n\\nTUCKER: (Laughter) Well, I remember thinking to myself that this probably isn't going to go anywhere. With all due respect to President Clinton, I thought that he gave the answers that were most politically safe. You know, again, I'm not sure a national conversation about race would move us along. I would much prefer if we could attempt to have some history lessons. I think that this is a country that has failed to grapple with its ugly and violent racial history. I think that one of the things that got Northam in trouble is that he has no sense of the history of blackface in this country.\\n\\nSo I think it would be great if, at high schools and colleges across the country, instead of a big national dialogue on race, we started trying to teach something of the true history of race in this country. We need to talk about the fact that America was built on the free, forced labor of black people. You know, we are still struggling here in the South - in Virginia, which was the second capital of the Confederacy. We're still struggling over the actual history of the Civil War. I think that would be a place to start.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S ROBOT PARK)\\n\\nDEMBY: So let's talk about Virginia. After the break, we get into a little bit of history and a lot of context around this week's drama with the Virginia-based New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie.\\n\\nMERAJI: Stay with us.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S ROBOT PARK)\\n\\nDEMBY: Gene.\\n\\nMERAJI: Shereen.\\n\\nDEMBY: Charles Barkley.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, AMERICAN RACE)\\n\\nCHARLES BARKLEY: We're going to talk about race, stereotypes. We're going to talk about religion. We are going to start a dialogue.\\n\\nDEMBY: CODE SWITCH.\\n\\nSo I know before the break, Cynthia said it was mostly white politicians calling for racial dialogue. We've got to shout out Sir Charles here, though. He had a TV show a couple years ago trying to get people to sit down and have tough conversations about race. Barkley saying I want to start a dialogue is, like, my favorite Twitter meme.\\n\\nMERAJI: (Laughter) But back to the Old Dominion, where Governor Northam is fighting for his political career. Jamelle Bouie, a columnist for The New York Times, just published a piece titled Blackface Is The Tip Of The Iceberg. And he spoke to Eugene from Charlottesville, where he lives.\\n\\nJAMELLE BOUIE: And Virginia, famously or infamously, during the Jim Crow period, was home to massive resistance, where white Virginians in communities across the state, including very prominently in Charlottesville, closed the public schools rather than integrate them. It took some time before there was public school integration in Virginia schools.\\n\\nDEMBY: Jamelle said that in the post-civil rights era, Virginia has seen two diverging political trend lines.\\n\\nBOUIE: The first is that the state, really, since 1970, has had rapid population growth, has become much more diverse. Really, in that regard, since 1990, the state's become, like, remarkably diverse with Asian immigrants, Hispanic immigrants. Right now Virginia, I think, is about 19 percent African-American, which is pretty high nationally and puts it kind of, like, in the middle for a Southern state.\\n\\nDEMBY: So that's the first trend. The second trend line...\\n\\nBOUIE: A political culture that is not - I wouldn't say stuck in the '60s and '70s, but its principal movers and shakers all sort of, like, reflect the way politics were 30 years ago or 40 years ago. This style of politics is kind of referred to as the Virginia way. It is a bipartisan style of politics, but it's bipartisan in part because the politicians and so on and so forth come out of a similar kind of social world of, you know, the University of Virginia or the University of Richmond or sort of any of the state's kind of more elite public and private institutions - come out of a culture of law, business.\\n\\nIt's a style of politics that is very attuned to making sure that there isn't very much friction for the state's major business interests, for the state's major, like, industrial interests and has never been that attuned to kind of shaping social policy. And the state has kind of had a hands-off approach to much of this. You can kind of analogize it to sort of, like, the New South ideology that pops up in kind of the - as the Jim Crow South is coming to an end, this idea that Southern states will modernize and advance by really catering to business interests.\\n\\nDEMBY: And so Jamelle says Ralph Northam finds himself at the head of a party that's stuck between these two realities.\\n\\nBOUIE: He entered state politics in the late 2000s. Prior to that, he was a practicing pediatrician. He had voted for George W. Bush two times. He was considered sort of conservative but a conservative Democrat coming out of, like, this tradition of glad-handing, very transactional politics. And Northam has found himself, as he's advanced in his career, at the helm of a political - a Virginia Democratic Party that's both somewhat revitalized after kind of Republican dominance for 10 years in the state and also is very hostile to the kinds of politics that used to define Virginia. Right? That...\\n\\nDEMBY: Because of the brownness of that Democratic Party?\\n\\nBOUIE: Because of the brownness of the Democratic Party, because that Democratic Party is increasingly college educated - much like nationally, the Democratic Party in Virginia no longer wins the votes of what you would, I guess, call working-class whites. Its white support comes from college-educated whites in Northern Virginia and then throughout the state where there's sort of high concentrations of them, like in Charlottesville.\\n\\nDEMBY: So Northam steps into office as the state is wrestling with all these big controversies around the Confederate monuments. The violence in Charlottesville is a response to the controversies around the monuments. What kinds of stances did Northam take around issues like the monuments and to other racialized issues?\\n\\nBOUIE: Right. That's what's interesting. I mean, in places where there was already kind of continuity he could continue. Right? So the previous governor, also a Democrat, Terry McAuliffe was very aggressive about restoring voting rights to former felons. And he was - McAuliffe was picking up after the governor before him, Bob McDonnell, who was a Republican who also kind of moved this process forward in a way that hadn't been done before. And Northam has continued that, not an opponent of it by any means.\\n\\nDuring the Charlottesville stuff, which was during the election season, Northam - it was clear he wasn't quite sure what to say. He wasn't apologetic towards - right? - the instigators of what happened in Charlottesville. He wasn't defending the Confederate statues. He recognized that the state Democrats and the state Democratic Party had very much adopted a take-down-the-statues attitude. But when it appeared - right? - that the race might be closer than it looked, that his opponent, Republican Ed Gillespie, may have a shot at winning, he definitely backed off a little bit. He suggested that, you know, maybe we don't take them down; maybe we do something else.\\n\\nYou saw a kind of similar thing with the question of sanctuary cities, where Gillespie was really hitting Northam very hard on immigration and on kind of immigration and law enforcement. And the sort of the more liberal Democrats in the Virginia Democratic Party, which is quite a few of them, were dismissing these attacks outright. And Northam was sort of willing to say, well, maybe, you know, if governor, I will do something about sanctuary cities - in a less punitive way.\\n\\nDEMBY: Your piece in Monday's New York Times, it's called Blackface Is The Tip Of The Iceberg. You write that, quote, in American politics, lawmakers can get a pass for almost anything short of open allegiance to racist ideologies or the explicit use of racist imagery. But then you say that that misses all the other ways that racism is not condemned in our politics.\\n\\nBOUIE: I mean, one reason I don't think it happens - and I don't think I quite said this in my column - but is that I'm not sure that people understand those things as being racist - right? - that there's a sort of, like, deniability behind them. If I say, this bill that restricts voting in ways that pretty specifically target black Americans is racist, someone could respond - and people do respond saying, well, don't you think it's important that people have identification before they go vote? Why don't you think black Americans can get that kind of identification? - in kind of an accusatory way. Because so much of, I think, racially discriminatory policymaking has always been, you know, what the courts call facially neutral, it's hard to be definitive in a way that you can be definitive with something like blackface. So that's one thing.\\n\\nI think the other thing relates to just how the public broadly kind of, like, understands or thinks of racism, which is that it doesn't - the mainstream public, the largely white public, doesn't tend to think about racism in ways that go beyond kind of, like, individual prejudice, bias or hatred. And so to say - right? - that this piece of policymaking is racist - when like, a typical, you know, viewer of cable news or whatever hears that, what they hear is, the person who did this policy has malice or hatred towards black people or some other racial group. What they do not hear is that this policy burdens a particular racial group in a specific way that kind of diminishes their life chances.\\n\\nDEMBY: Jamelle Bouie is a columnist for The New York Times. He lives in Charlottesville. And he's a PostBourgie alum. Appreciate you, Jam.\\n\\nBOUIE: Appreciate you, man.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S ROBOT PARK)\\n\\nDEMBY: All right, y'all.

{"original": "Former George W. Bush Advisor Among Foreign Policy Experts Who Say Never Trump\\n\\nKori Schake, a foreign policy adviser to President George W. Bush, is one of the Republicans who's declared support for Hillary Clinton. Scott Simon talks with her about her choice.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nDonald Trump may have had the most chaotic week of his campaign - a verbal brawl with a Gold Star family, snapping at the mother of a crying baby, withholding his endorsement of prominent Republicans for a few days. A number of people in his own party said they can't ever vote for Donald Trump.\\n\\nKori Schake says she'll even vote for Hillary Clinton. Ms. Schake worked on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. She advised John McCain during his run for president. She's now a research fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Thanks very much for being with us.\\n\\nKORI SCHAKE: It's a pleasure.\\n\\nSIMON: Is your vote for Mrs. Clinton an endorsement of her policies?\\n\\nSCHAKE: It's an endorsement of her national security policies (laughter), not of her economic or social policies. But I think for people like me, Donald Trump is such a potential danger to the country. In fact, I think he's already doing damage to the country that I feel an obligation to vote for him.\\n\\nSIMON: Well, let me ask - because in the opinion of the director of the FBI, Hillary Clinton was reckless in her handling of email while secretary of state - reckless is his word - and she has been, in the opinion of many, disingenuous in explaining that, even this week. So why do you trust her on national security issues?\\n\\nSCHAKE: So I agree with both of those judgments, that she was reckless. In fact, I think what she did was illegal. And it's disgraceful that she's avoiding responsibility for those choices. But I, nonetheless, believe she would be a much safer pair of hands in which to entrust the country than Donald Trump.\\n\\nSIMON: A safer pair of hands, you mean - if I may - near the nuclear button, which, by the way, we're told doesn't actually exist, but, you know, that's a living metaphor for many people.\\n\\nSCHAKE: Yes, I think as secretary of state she was calm and responsible and deliberative. Her support for the surge in Afghanistan was important to the president making a better choice than I think he otherwise have (inaudible).\\n\\nSIMON: By the way, it sounds like your phone might be giving out, but let's press ahead with this. Your party had primary after primary. Donald Trump won an overwhelming number of votes and the nomination. Is it just sour grapes not to endorse him?\\n\\nSCHAKE: No, it's not sour grapes. I've voted for a lot of Republicans who I hadn't supported in primaries. I think Donald Trump is different and dangerous than other candidates. I think the kinds of comments he's made about America's allies and about America's role in the world make me cross the line for the first time.\\n\\nSIMON: We should note, your sister's a Democrat. She's - I believe - deputy communications director for Mrs. Clinton.\\n\\nSCHAKE: That's right. She and I will be voting for the same candidate for the first time.\\n\\nSIMON: And is this (laughter) - is this the first? I mean, I guess this might make Thanksgiving a little happier for the two of you.\\n\\nSCHAKE: (Laughter) No, Thanksgiving's always happy for us.\\n\\nSIMON: Aw. We mentioned that you worked for President George W. Bush, who advised John McCain. In your circle of friends, people there at the Hoover Institution - without violating any any confidences - your friends and colleagues - is your opinion widely held or are people who ordinarily would support the Republican candidate talking about voting for Hillary Clinton?\\n\\nSCHAKE: I think this is a real time of crisis for Republicans. It's hard for many of my friends to think about supporting Donald Trump. And it's very hard for many of my friends to think about supporting Hillary Clinton. In fact, I would have indulged the luxury of writing in one of my terrific nephews for president if I hadn't seen that the polls during the British referendum were off by 12 points. And my concern that (inaudible) be accurate, and everybody's vote's actually going to count this election.\\n\\nSIMON: Kori Schake is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. She joined us by Skype. Thanks very much.\\n\\nSCHAKE: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Why You Should Still Wear A Mask And Avoid Crowds After Getting The COVID-19 Vaccine\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\\n\\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but health officials say that even after you get vaccinated against COVID-19, you still need to practice the usual pandemic precautions, at least for a while. That means steering clear of crowds, continuing to wear a good mask in public, maintaining 6 feet or more of distance from people outside your household and frequently washing your hands. We talked to infectious disease specialists to get a better understanding of why.\\n\\nWhy do I have to continue with precautions after I've been vaccinated?\\n\\nIn the short run, it will take some time for the vaccine's effectiveness to build up. (Effectiveness is defined as not getting sick with COVID-19. If 100 vaccinated people are exposed to a virus and 50 of them subsequently develop symptoms, that vaccine is 50% effective.)\\n\\nWith the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December found that protection doesn't start until 12 days after the first shot and that it reaches 52% effectiveness a few weeks later. A week after the second vaccination, the effectiveness rate hits 95%. In its application for authorization, Moderna reported a protection rate of 51% two weeks after the first immunization and 94% two weeks after the second dose.\\n\\nThat's not 100%, notes Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, as well as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory board. That means one out of every 20 people who get this vaccine could still get moderate to severe infection.\\n\\nSo, reason No. 1 to continue with precautions is to protect yourself.\\n\\nCan I spread the virus to others even if I'm fully vaccinated?\\n\\nThis is an important question, but scientists studying the shots' effectiveness don't have an answer yet. And for public health experts, that lack of knowledge means you should act like the answer is yes.\\n\\nHere's why: Before approving the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the FDA asked the vaccine manufacturers only whether their products protect people from COVID-19 symptoms. They didn't ask if the vaccines stop people who've been vaccinated from nevertheless spreading the virus to others. The emergency authorizations by the FDA that have allowed distribution of the two new vaccines cite only their ability to keep you — the person vaccinated — from becoming severely sick with COVID-19.\\n\\nIn the words of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\\n\\nThe data to answer the question of whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus are just now being collected.\\n\\nHow can you spread a virus if you've been vaccinated?\\n\\nAll the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine candidates under consideration for use in the U.S. rely on bits of genetic material or virus protein — not anything that could grow into an active SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19.\\n\\nThe concern instead with the COVID-19 vaccine is about whether you might still have an asymptomatic infection despite immunization — without symptoms, but able to shed virus.\\n\\nHere's how that might work: Let's say you've been vaccinated and you encounter SARS-CoV-2. You're much less likely to develop symptoms — that's clear. But your immune system may not fight off the virus completely — it might allow some viruses to survive and reproduce and get expelled from your nose or mouth in a breath, cough or sneeze. Remember: No one can be sure yet if this actually happens or if it happens often enough that you'd be emitting enough active virus to sicken someone else.\\n\\nWhy didn't the FDA demand information on infectivity before authorizing the first two vaccines?\\n\\nIn a word, time. Dr. Larry Corey is a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and helps lead the COVID-19 Prevention Network, a federally funded consortium of vaccine experts who've been testing vaccines. We wanted to get an answer quickly, Corey says, and to do so required as simple an experimental protocol as possible. You can't hang a lot of bells and whistles on a trial, he says.\\n\\nEven though the pre-authorization studies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were as streamlined as possible, they still required quite a lot of work. Each of the 75,000 volunteers had to come into a clinic; get a test for the coronavirus; get either a vaccine or a placebo shot (without knowing which they'd received); return for a second shot; and come back to the clinic for testing anytime in the interim if they showed any symptoms of having caught the virus.\\n\\nAdding in even more coronavirus tests along the way to see if the vaccinated volunteers had picked up or were transmitting the virus would have delayed the initial results considerably, Corey says. And in the midst of the pandemic, speed was of the essence.\\n\\nSo how will we get an answer to whether vaccinated people can infect others?\\n\\nResearchers are checking now on the folks vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna trials for antibodies showing that they've been infected. It's not a perfect measure, Corey notes, because the antibody tests aren't always accurate and antibodies can be transient. Moderna officials have hinted that their vaccine prevents some shedding, but they haven't been specific on how much. Some people who volunteered for the vaccine studies will be checked for evidence of the virus itself.\\n\\nIf someone is found to be shedding the virus, then researchers will check to see if that virus is capable of reproducing itself and, if it is, whether there's enough to infect other people. That raises another unknown: It's not yet clear what an infectious dose would be.\\n\\nNailing down the answers to all these questions is a laborious process. And no one is saying yet how soon the results of these sorts of studies of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines will be available.\\n\\nThere are other ways to get at the answer. The COVID-19 Prevention Network has proposed an experimental study that would involve vaccinating more than 20,000 college students with Moderna's vaccine, checking them multiple times per week for virus shedding and doing contact tracing when infections occurred. The trial, which would cost several hundred million dollars, has so far been turned down by federal funders.\\n\\nThere are other candidate COVID-19 vaccines in the pipeline, and tests will need to be done on them as well. Volunteers in an experimental trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine tested themselves for the virus. The results so far, posted Dec. 8 in The Lancet, suggest that the candidate vaccine may partly, but not totally, protect against viral shedding. In a commentary posted the same day in The Lancet, researchers from Johns Hopkins University said that the observation provides some hope that the vaccine stops some asymptomatic shedding but that the evidence gathered so far is too slight to be considered conclusive.\\n\\nMaybe one of the vaccines that are in the pipeline would be a better idea?\\n\\nIf your turn for vaccination comes, there's no reason to wait. While vaccines currently being tested are different in design from the Pfizer and Moderna products, scientists say there's no biological reason to think those vaccines will be more or less protective against shedding.\\n\\nNow that I'm vaccinated, can I take my mask off in a crowded room if everyone else has also been vaccinated?\\n\\nYou might think you're home free in that case, but not yet. Remember that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not 100% effective, and many in the research community still advise caution. Once most people are protected and there's less virus circulating in the air — and less circulating in the community — the advice and restrictions on this may ease up a bit. One vision of the new normal, whether that's later in 2021 or even 2022, is an eventual relaxation of the recommendations, with occasional renewals when the virus flares up in a community.\\n\\nWhat about the new variant from the U.K.? Will that make a difference in terms of spreading the virus after vaccination?\\n\\nThe newly identified variant, B.1.1.7, hasn't been around long enough to say for certain that the new vaccines are effective against it, but scientists aren't too worried about that — lab studies suggest the vaccines will be protective against this strain.\\n\\nHowever, infectious disease specialists are concerned that any strain that is more contagious — which B.1.1.7 clearly is — might quickly increase the number of COVID-19 cases in the world.\\n\\nIt appears that the people infected with this new variant, at least in the U.K., have an increased amount of virus, says Dr. David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The hypothesis is they could spread it more easily from their nasal passages. Whether there is actually an increased risk of transmitting the virus is currently being studied.\\n\\nIf the new variant increases the risk of shedding or just provides more chances for it to happen, increased masking and distancing, crowd avoidance and hand-washing will help stop the spread.\\n\\nSo what's the bottom line?\\n\\nWith cases and deaths surging throughout the U.S., the people who are treating COVID-19 patients really want you to continue to wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands, even if you've been vaccinated, until the research on shedding has yielded some answers. Dr. Carlos del Rio of Emory University says he knows taking precautions can be taxing, but he urges us all to hang on and keep it up.\\n\\nIt's not like you'll need to wear a mask for the rest of your life, he says. You need to wear your mask until we have the data, and we're trying to get the answers as fast as we can.\\n\\nJoanne Silberner, a former health policy correspondent for NPR, is a freelance journalist living in Seattle."}
{"original": "Justices Let Alabama Execute Death Row Inmate Who Wanted Imam By His Side\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption DAVE MARTIN/AP DAVE MARTIN/AP\\n\\nDeath Row inmate Domineque Ray hoped that when he took his final breath, he could find comfort in the presence of his Muslim spiritual adviser. But the Alabama prison where Ray was awaiting execution wouldn't allow it. Prison officials would only allow their own Christian chaplain to offer the prisoner solace from inside the execution chamber. They said it would be a security risk to let someone into the room who wasn't an employee of the state's corrections department. Ray's imam, Yusef Maisonet, could only watch from the next room, behind glass.\\n\\nRay challenged that decision, and a federal appeals court on Wednesday granted a stay of execution until it could determine whether the prison had violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by preferring one religion over another.\\n\\nBut the next day, by a vote of 5-4, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the execution to go forward. Ray's life ended Thursday night, by lethal injection. His imam watched from a separate room, The Associated Press reported.\\n\\nRay was sentenced to death for the 1995 rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl, Tiffany Harville. Her body was found in a cotton field. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called the execution a long-delayed appointment with justice, local media reported.\\n\\nIn lifting the stay of execution, the high court's conservative majority said little, only citing what it called the last-minute nature of Ray's request as the reason for its decision. Because Ray waited until January 28, 2019 to seek relief, we grant the State's application to vacate the stay, the court wrote.\\n\\nThe court's four liberal justices called the decision profoundly wrong.\\n\\nThe clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another, Justice Elena Kagan wrote. But the State's policy does just that.\\n\\nChristian prisoners can be administered last rites in the execution chamber by a minister of their own faith, but prisoners of any other religion can't have a minister of their own faith by their side, the dissent said. That treatment goes against the Establishment Clause's core principle of denominational neutrality.\\n\\nThe dissent acknowledged that prison security is a compelling interest that might justify such religious discrimination. However, the State has offered no evidence to show that its wholesale prohibition on outside spiritual advisers is necessary to achieve that goal, Kagan wrote.\\n\\nWhy couldn't Ray's imam receive whatever training in execution protocol the Christian chaplain received? The state has no answer. the dissent said. Why wouldn't it be sufficient for the imam to pledge, under penalty of contempt, that he will not interfere with the State's ability to perform the execution? The State doesn't say.\\n\\nThe dissent also took issue with the conservative justices' reasoning that Ray waited too long to bring his claim. The warden denied his request to have an imam by his side on Jan. 23, and Ray filed his complaint five days later, Kagan wrote. And Alabama state law explicitly provides that the inmate's spiritual adviser of choice may be present at an execution, she wrote.\\n\\nRay has put forward a powerful claim that his religious rights will be violated at the moment the State puts him to death, Kagan wrote. Instead, this Court short-circuits that ordinary process — and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument — just so the State can meet its preferred execution date.\\n\\nAt Ray's request, the prison kept its chaplain out of the execution chamber."}

Ambassador\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 5:20 a.m. ET Monday\\n\\nState Department spokesperson Heather Nauert withdrew herself from consideration on Saturday for the nomination of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\\n\\nI am grateful to President Trump and Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo for the trust they placed in me for considering me for the position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, she said, according to a statement released by the State Department. However, the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.\\n\\nThe Washington Post reports that Nauert's nomination faced complications after it was revealed that she had hired a foreign-born nanny about 10 years ago who didn't have the proper work visa and Nauert didn't pay proper taxes on time, according to two officials involved in her nomination process.\\n\\nTrump picked the former Fox & Friends host to become the next ambassador to the U.N. in December. Had she been confirmed, Nauert would have replaced Nikki Haley, who resigned as ambassador in October.\\n\\nBut in the more than two months since her nomination was announced, Nauert's credentials for the position have been questioned.\\n\\nNauert had no government or foreign policy experience until she joined the Trump administration in 2017, NPR's Michele Kelemen reported, beyond overseas stints for ABC, including in Baghdad.\\n\\nDuring her nearly two-year tenure in the State Department, Nauert has worked alongside former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and then Pompeo.\\n\\nHeather Nauert has performed her duties as a senior member of my team with unequalled excellence, Pompeo said in a statement. Her personal decision today to withdraw her name from consideration to become the nominee for United States Ambassador to the United Nations is a decision for which I have great respect.\\n\\nHer time at the State Department was not without controversy. As NPR's Kelemen noted following Nauert's nomination:\\n\\nShe faced some criticism for a tourist-like Instagram post from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on a trip that was meant to focus on the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. There have been other missteps, including the time when she cited D-Day — the Allied invasion of Normandy against the Nazis — as an example of America's strong relationship with Germany.\\n\\nState Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino says Trump will pick a new nominee for the position soon. Before nominating Nauert, Trump had considered former White House aide Dina Powell.\\n\\nThere had also been rumors that his daughter Ivanka Trump was under consideration. NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported that the president was asked whether he was considering nominating Ivanka Trump for the U.N. post. Trump replied that she would be 'dynamite' in the job, but he was concerned about being accused of nepotism."}

But as Florence Mattei hands out a pamphlet to her homeroom class at the Southlands School in Rome, she tells them they may want to give this assignment a chance.\\n\\nWho would like to read what it's about? she asks the room full of 18-year-olds.\\n\\nA senior named Alessio translates from Italian into English: For the people born in 1998 there is a 500-euro bonus that you can spend on cultural things, such as going to the cinema, visiting museums and this kind of stuff.\\n\\nHe stares at the page in disbelief. But it's true. Starting this month, Italy is offering its 18-year-old residents the equivalent of $563 to spend on culture, from concert tickets, books and museum admission to other qualifying events.\\n\\nTo get the money, they need to register online and download an app.\\n\\nDo we want to try? says the teacher. Yeah? So get your phone.\\n\\nYouth unemployment in Italy is nearly 40 percent in a country that's been struggling economically for years. So the free cash is a welcome surprise for teens like Daniele Montagna, who knows where he is going to spend his first.\\n\\nOn the concert of JB — Justin Bieber! he rejoices.\\n\\nAnd he can. The program doesn't distinguish between pop culture and highbrow culture.\\n\\nCombating extremism\\n\\nThe Italian government is hoping the program will educate kids born in Italy as well as integrate a growing population of foreign residents, dissuading alienated youths from following radical Islam.\\n\\nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi first announced the so-called Culture Bonus last November after the Paris massacre, when Islamist terrorists killed 130 people inside a theater and outside on the streets.\\n\\nThey destroy statues, we protect them, he said in a speech at the time. They burn books, we're the country of libraries; they envision terror, we respond with culture.\\n\\nBut some question whether exposing young Muslims to, say, Lady Gaga will really endear them to Western culture.\\n\\nThere is a chance that Lady Gaga is exactly what's going to make somebody angry, says Barak Mendelsohn, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia and an expert in combating extremism. That doesn't mean that they buy into your values. We've seen radicals trying to take advantage of the welfare state, funding themselves while building bombs.\\n\\nHe points to the Paris attackers. French authorities estimate they collected more than 50,000 euros in unemployment benefits — even while at least one of them had a job.\\n\\nThey don't have any ideological obstacle in taking money from Western countries, Mendelsohn adds.\\n\\nItaly's fears\\n\\nWhile Italy has so far avoided the recent spate of terrorism in Europe, the Colosseum and other Roman monuments figure prominently in ISIS propaganda videos.\\n\\nThat has put Italian authorities on high alert, as migrants and refugees arrive by the tens of thousands every year.

{"original": "The Future Of The Iran Nuclear Deal\\n\\nThe Iran nuclear deal, promising Iran sanctions relief for limited nuclear activity, still exists. European partners want to save the deal but face pressure from both Iran and the U.S.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nMuch of the U.N.-Iran crisis we have seen playing out in recent days still centers around the 2015 nuclear deal. We're going to take a look now at whether that deal is, indeed, doomed. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of it two years ago, re-imposed sanctions that it lifted. In turn, Iran started to break parts of the deal. European partners in the deal are caught in the middle. They want to save the deal but gave Iran a warning this past week on Wednesday. NPR's Peter Kenyon looks at where it stands.\\n\\nPETER KENYON, BYLINE: Nonproliferation experts are wondering if the end is near for a complicated piece of diplomacy that saw Iran significantly cut back on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says the signs aren't good.\\n\\nJAMES ACTON: Well, the deal is not dead yet. But I think, realistically, it's not likely to survive very much longer.\\n\\nKENYON: Acton says he's been pessimistic about the deal's future ever since President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018, saying Iran needed to negotiate a much tougher and longer-lasting agreement. Acton says after that, it was only a matter of time before Iran stopped abiding by its commitments, as well. Now, he says, the Iranian attacks on U.S. military personnel at bases in Iraq, and especially the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, have pushed things even closer to the breaking point.\\n\\nACTON: I think over the long term, that assassination probably will speed up the demise of the deal by further straining U.S.-Iranian relations and creating incentives in - within Iran for it to pull out of its remaining commitments.\\n\\nKENYON: Other nonproliferation experts are taking a slightly more optimistic view. Laura Rockwood, longtime nuclear safeguards official with the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, now directs the group Open Nuclear Network in Vienna. She says, rhetoric aside, what Iran has actually done to date doesn't add up to a sprint to acquire nuclear weapons.\\n\\nFirst, she says, Iran is still cooperating with IAEA inspectors. Second, Iran has also not threatened to pull out of another important agreement, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Rockwood says her cautious optimism could change if Tehran starts enriching to a higher level of purity - say, to 20% or more.\\n\\nLAURA ROCKWOOD: If Iran were to enrich uranium above 20%, which is considered high-enriched uranium - probably not high enough or weapons-grade, but it's more than what they need - that would send a very bad signal.\\n\\nKENYON: At stake is a deal designed to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least a decade. Rockwood says most of Iran's violations can still be reversed fairly easily. What would really set alarm bells ringing would be a move to stop allowing the inspectors to see what's going on at Iran's nuclear sites.\\n\\nROCKWOOD: Incredibly important - it's fundamental. If they were to choose to not cooperate with the IAEA, this would send an extremely bad message.\\n\\nKENYON: The latest pressure on the deal came Wednesday from Europe. Britain, France and Germany announced they're invoking the deal's dispute resolution mechanism, which amounts to a formal accusation that Iran's breaching the agreement. That prompted Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during his first Friday prayer sermon in eight years, to blast those European countries as enemies of Iran.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSUPREME LEADER ALI KHAMENEI: (Non-English language spoken).\\n\\nKENYON: Today, everyone knows it clearly, he said. After waiting for one year, Khamenei added, it became clear that they, the Europeans, are actually servants of the U.S. - servants of the U.S. He repeated it for emphasis.\\n\\nThe European move could lead to more sanctions on Iran, which is what the U.S. wants. Meanwhile, the German defense minister has confirmed that the White House threatened its European allies with punitive trade tariffs if they didn't formally accuse Iran of violating the nuclear deal. Now they've done so, and they're waiting for Iran's response.\\n\\nPeter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Hong Kong Police Arrest Activists\\n\\nIn Hong Kong, dozens of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists were arrested — the biggest roundup under the new national security law since its introduction last summer.\\n\\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\\n\\nMore than 50 people were arrested in Hong Kong in morning raids yesterday. It is the biggest roundup of pro-democracy activists and politicians since a new national security law was introduced last summer. NPR China correspondent John Ruwitch looks at what's behind this latest move.\\n\\nJOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: After the Chinese government sent the army into Tiananmen Square in 1989, killing possibly thousands of pro-democracy protesters, it paid a price. There was outcry from the international community and economic and political sanctions for years. But it learned from the experience, and now it's applying those lessons in Hong Kong.\\n\\nJEFFREY WASSERSTROM: What's been happening in Hong Kong is everything that happened, repression-wise, in 1989 except the massacre.\\n\\nRUWITCH: Jeffrey Wasserstrom is a historian at the University of California, Irvine.\\n\\nWASSERSTROM: These moves in Hong Kong have been an attempt, I think, by Beijing to have that same kind of deterrent effect without having the equivalent to the Tank Man photograph.\\n\\nRUWITCH: And that has had one big consequence, he says - less global alarm. When Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, critics feared it would be used to silence dissent. And these arrests seem to confirm those fears. But Ho-Fung Hung of Johns Hopkins University says China feels like now might be the time to take a chance.\\n\\nHO-FUNG HUNG: What they fear most is this U.S. pushback for sanctions and things like that that now that U.S. is in the transition mode. So it is a kind of a time that they think that they can do whatever they want.\\n\\nRUWITCH: The arrests come just days after Beijing reached an investment deal with Europe that was years in the making and shine a light on the leadership's thinking.\\n\\nHUNG: China's calculation is that European is desperate to have this deal.\\n\\nRUWITCH: Desperate because China offers a huge market. And while other economies are struggling because of the pandemic, China's is humming. The China-EU agreement isn't ratified, and yesterday's arrests may put it at risk. A trade agreement with Pacific nations inked a few weeks ago may also be in play, but Chinese leader Xi Jinping seems to think otherwise and not without reason, says Wasserstrom.\\n\\nWASSERSTROM: The Chinese Communist Party has made a whole series of moves during the last year or even the last years, and there haven't been dramatic consequences, really.\\n\\nRUWITCH: Trump's sanctioned some Chinese companies and officials and moved to revoke Hong Kong's special trade status. And some European countries have spoken out against Beijing's tightening grip on the former British colony. Donald Clarke of George Washington University Law says pushback on these arrests might not change China's course but could help.\\n\\nDONALD CLARKE: A robust response could lead to, you know, a decision by the Hong Kong and PRC authorities to impose, you know, less harsh sentences than they were planning or indeed to acquit some.\\n\\nRUWITCH: But to really get Xi's attention, some experts say, it would take something like coordinated sanctions on top Chinese officials and possibly even on Xi himself or a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which China is hosting. Steve Tsang of the University of London says even if that doesn't happen, Beijing still pays a price for its actions in Hong Kong.\\n\\nSTEVE TSANG: If we are looking at the overall interests of China as a whole, I think the policy is backfiring because a vibrant, prosperous, successful Hong Kong is in the best interest of China, not only of Hong Kong.\\n\\nRUWITCH: But he says backfiring isn't an issue if your main concern is the Communist Party's power and Xi Jinping's grip on it.\\n\\nJohn Ruwitch, NPR News.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump's rhetoric on China and trade has been blunt, to say the least.\\n\\nWe can't continue to allow China to rape our country — and that's what they're doing, he said at a May 2016 campaign rally. It's the greatest theft in the history of the world.\\n\\nHis tone was a bit more measured leading up to his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though the message was similar: The U.S. must be tough on China when it comes to trade.\\n\\nThe meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses, the president wrote across two tweets. Trump continued, American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\\n\\nTrump's anti-trade rhetoric was great politics during the campaign. But the hard truth is that getting those jobs back from China just won't happen — indeed, China isn't primarily responsible for manufacturing job losses in recent years. But if Trump is concerned about the jobs lost to China, there are other steps he can take right now, some of which don't at all involve negotiating with President Xi.\\n\\nWhat exactly has (and hasn't) the U.S. lost to China?\\n\\nThe U.S. has most definitely lost jobs to China. In perhaps the most commonly cited recent paper on the matter, a group of economists led by MIT's David Autor found that between 1990 and 2007, Chinese import competition accounted for the loss of 1 million manufacturing jobs — about 25 percent of the total manufacturing job loss over that period.\\n\\n(In fact, Trump may want to thank Xi for all his country's exports; those same economists plus Lund University's Kaveh Majlesi found in a January paper that, all other things being equal, if the growth in Chinese import penetration had been 50 percent lower than the actual growth in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania than it was between 2000 and 2016, those states would have chosen Hillary Clinton, and she would have won the Electoral College.)\\n\\nIn addition, China has not lived up to a variety of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization, according to a January report from the U.S. trade representative's office. In areas including intellectual property protections, the government's favoring of state-owned enterprises and troubling agricultural policies that block U.S. market access, the USTR said the Chinese government could stand to improve.\\n\\nIs a country like China different, and is it more likely that they are — cheating isn't necessarily the right word, but — doing more of these kinds of things that are more worrisome than other countries? said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And I think the answer to that is probably yes.\\n\\nSo there are reasons for concern regarding the U.S. trade relationship with China. But if China did indeed suck 25 percent of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S. over nearly two decades, that leaves about 75 percent of those jobs that weren't lost to China.\\n\\nWhat happened? Automation is a huge factor here. U.S. factories simply grew more efficient over time. In fact, while the number of manufacturing jobs plummeted — manufacturing output nevertheless grew.\\n\\nI used to go out on an auto factory floor and it looks like Fifth Avenue in New York at Christmastime, said Carla Hills, who served as U.S. trade representative under George H.W. Bush. Today, you look at the floor and there are six people with long white smocks and buffers on their shoes.\\n\\nWhat can be done?\\n\\nThere are a host of things that Trump might be able to do to improve the U.S. economy when it comes to trade with China. But let's start with one thing he can't do:\\n\\nTrump can't bring back those lost jobs\\n\\nHe at one point threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on China's goods. There are some big problems with that approach. One is that it simply wouldn't be that effective.\\n\\nThat would bring some manufacturing production back to the U.S., said Gordon Hanson, who co-wrote that study on U.S. jobs moving to China. But that's not the same thing as manufacturing employment. The jobs that left were 20th century jobs. That is, they were jobs in factories that were built using older vintage technology that was more labor intensive than 21st century tech in which automation is more present.\\n\\nNot only that, but that could also have the pesky side effect of launching a trade war. Still, there's plenty more that could be helpful to U.S. goods producers.\\n\\nCombating China's trade practices\\n\\nRather than threaten massive tariffs, Trump could try to make the footing a little more equal for both U.S. and Chinese goods.\\n\\nThere are a lot of industries in which you could make the case that China is violating existing trade rules, said Hanson. But the response to that is not an across-the-board tariff. The response is to go industry by industry and pick those things apart.\\n\\nThat could be a long (but worthwhile) process of filing complaints with the World Trade Organization. Still, a long string of nonsplashy administrative actions may not suit President Trump's decidedly unsubtle governing style.\\n\\nWork with other countries\\n\\nChina trades with a lot of other places besides the U.S., so the U.S. could band together with those places to put pressure on China to change its trade practices.\\n\\nAccording to Hanson, the U.S. could get together with the EU, get together with a bunch of WTO partners, document violations, and say, 'Look: if you don't remove those subsidies, then we're going to enact a series of retaliatory tariffs on other products.' \\n\\nNegotiate\\n\\nTrump loves to complain about the U.S. trade deficit with China. And it is indeed big — in 2016, the U.S. imported $347 billion more than it exported to China, accounting for almost half of the total U.S. trade deficit with the world.\\n\\nTrade deficits aren't inherently bad, but if the U.S. does want to sell more goods to China, the Trump administration could try to negotiate China into being more open to U.S. products, says one expert.\\n\\nIn general, China's market access restrictions prevent the consumption of American goods and services, wrote the Brookings Institution's David Dollar this week. He points to one example: In automobiles, a 25 percent import tariff plus domestic content rules in the past mean that American-brand cars sold in China have little U.S. content. Likewise, he said, China could be more open to U.S. agricultural and service industries.\\n\\nHowever, it doesn't make sense to make too big a deal (as Trump does) out of any single trade deficit with any country.\\n\\nBilateral trade deficits are not as relevant as your overall trade deficit, Hills said. I have a deficit with my grocery, and I have a surplus with my clients. But I can't have a surplus with my grocer. I have to buy from them.\\n\\nPolicies that have nothing to do with China\\n\\nMainstream economists often say that trade is ultimately a net good; it creates broad, albeit easy-to-ignore-in-everyday-life benefits, like cheaper goods and a wider variety of products. But it also comes with acute pain for those people who do lose jobs.\\n\\nThat same pain is felt by people who lose their jobs to robots, though, said Hills, and if the U.S. is serious about getting former manufacturing workers back to work, that means adopting policies outside of trade pacts.\\n\\nWe could be criticized for not addressing, in my opinion, the policy of skill training for those who have lost their jobs to automation, and the majority of job losses have been as a result of automation, said Hills. But if you're someone who lost their job — whether it's a miner in West Virginia or on the floor of a Ford factory — you don't really care if it's automation or international competition.\\n\\nShe points to the transition from horses and buggies to cars.\\n\\nThe question is, what do you do with the people who were driving the horses and the coaches? she said. They don't know how to drive cars. You've got to send them to a skill center.\\n\\nBut then, there's a related problem: Often when new jobs do pop up, they're not near the people who need those jobs, Bown pointed out. There's a related problem in the energy sector, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro wrote last week: The lion's share of the nation's new solar jobs aren't exactly in coal country. That means there could be some sort of way to help people relocate to where the jobs are, Bown added.\\n\\nOf course, none of that kind of domestic policy will come up as Trump meets with Xi Jinping this week. Plenty of issues will be hanging over their heads — North Korea and missile defense, for example. One thing that won't be hanging over them: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\nBecause Trump scrapped the TPP, which had been in process for nearly a decade, the two leaders come to a table where the game board for trade has been overturned and reset. China was not a party to that deal, but the deal was written to allow the U.S. to hem China in on trade by setting stiff and transparent rules on trade in Asia.\\n\\nHowever imperfect the TPP was, Hanson said, the U.S. did give China a lot more trading power by giving up the deal.\\n\\nWe just walked away from it and gave China carte blanche to dictate the way in which trade rules will be written in Asia for the next decade, Hanson said."}

Her character runs a restaurant similar to Hooters.\\n\\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST:\\n\\nChances are good you've seen the actor Regina Hall before. She's been in dozens of TV shows and movies from Ally McBeal to Black-ish, from the film Love And Basketball to last summer's raunchy female comedy smash Girls Trip.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GIRLS TRIP)\\n\\nREGINA HALL: (As Ryan Pierce) This weekend is all about the Flossy Posse. We're going to be staying up late, drinking, making memories that we can laugh about the rest of our lives because that is what a girls trip is for.\\n\\nBLOCK: In her new film, she leaves the Flossy Posse behind but is still surrounded by her girls. Regina Hall stars as Lisa. She runs a Hooters-style restaurant called Double Whammies where the servers spill out of tiny crop tops and short shorts. The film is called Support The Girls.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, SUPPORT THE GIRLS)\\n\\nHALL: (As Lisa Conroy) Excuse me, sir.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Character) Yeah.\\n\\nHALL: (As Lisa Conroy) My name is Lisa. I'm the general manager. And my girl just said you got a little disrespectful with her.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Character) What?\\n\\nHALL: (As Lisa Conroy) Well, you might have thought you were just having a little fun. But I have a zero-tolerance policy on disrespect. So you're going to have to go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Character) I haven't gotten my food yet.\\n\\nHALL: (As Lisa Conroy) You haven't paid for it, either. So let's just call it even.\\n\\nBLOCK: And Regina Hall joins me now from NPR West. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nHALL: Thank you so much for having me. This is a real treat to be here today.\\n\\nBLOCK: Well, let's talk about Double Whammies.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBLOCK: It's the kind of place that your character says is all about the triple B's.\\n\\nHALL: Boobs, brews and big screens (laughter).\\n\\nBLOCK: Yeah. That pretty much sums it up, right?\\n\\nHALL: Yeah. For a while there, that was my little world. We actually shot in this restaurant. But it was right across the parking lot from a Twin Peaks.\\n\\nBLOCK: Twin Peaks being a Double Whammies or Hooters equivalent.\\n\\nHALL: (Laughter) Yes. Yes.\\n\\nBLOCK: Not too much subtlety in the naming, I suppose, yeah?\\n\\nHALL: (Laughter) No. No. I think they make it clear. And so I don't - that kind of became the stomping grounds that we had, like, during lunch. And, you know....\\n\\nBLOCK: So you'd go and do - you'd do research across the street.\\n\\nHALL: Yeah. Right across the parking lot, we'd do research. And I have to say there were a lot of families that I saw in Twin Peaks. And a lot of times, the young women are actually taught to make sure that if there's a family or if people are on a date that you make sure that you give the female, you know, a lot of attention to make sure that they feel comfortable enough that they'd want to come back.\\n\\nBLOCK: The title of the movie Support The Girls also, you know - it does have a double meaning, not to put too fine a point on it. There is the...\\n\\nHALL: It actually does.\\n\\nBLOCK: Yeah.\\n\\nHALL: Yeah.\\n\\nBLOCK: The anatomical side - right? - of supporting the girls...\\n\\nHALL: (Laughter) Yeah.\\n\\nBLOCK: ...Given the push-up bras that they're wearing.\\n\\nHALL: Absolutely.\\n\\nBLOCK: But also your character's offering maternal, moral support as well.\\n\\nHALL: Absolutely - a lot of emotional support to these young girls who - she and they both realize they're in an environment where they're, you know, exploited. So what she tries to do is kind of maintain an integrity. I found it really interesting that Andrew wrote a movie about sisterhood and...\\n\\nBLOCK: This is the director.\\n\\nHALL: Yes - Andrew Bujalski, the director. You know, I found it interesting that he actually wrote a movie about sisterhood. And the backdrop was, you know, Double Whammies. It was just such an interesting juxtaposition to take.\\n\\nBLOCK: There's a scene where we see a waitress applying for a job. And she asks Lisa, do you get grabbed? And let's listen to what Lisa says in response.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, SUPPORT THE GIRLS)\\n\\nHALL: (As Lisa Conroy) This is a mainstream place, you know? And it's a family place, which means a lot of families come here. And it also means that we're all family. And yeah. You're not - you know, you're not wearing a whole lot of clothes. But trust me. If these guys wanted to go to a strip club, they know where to find them. They just come here so some sweet girls can take good care of them.\\n\\nBLOCK: Do you think she really believes that? Or is she trying to convince herself with that?\\n\\nHALL: I think she really believes that.\\n\\nBLOCK: Yeah?\\n\\nHALL: I do. And I also think that she knows with her being there that it's not going to be tolerated anyway because it's not about just the guys. It's about the system that they've created and that she demands.\\n\\nBLOCK: This is a really small movie in a lot of ways.\\n\\nHALL: Yeah.\\n\\nBLOCK: It takes place mostly over the course of one single day. It's low-budget.\\n\\nHALL: Yeah.\\n\\nBLOCK: It really couldn't be much different than the really splashy romp of Girls Trip. How do you explain sort of the different sides of your career that that appeals to?\\n\\nHALL: I actually read the script while I was in New Orleans shooting Girls Trip. And every day on Girls Trip, you know, we're having a ball. We're, like, ziplining across Bourbon Street.\\n\\nBLOCK: (Laughter).\\n\\nHALL: And I just got this little script that came, you know? And it was kind of interesting to watch just a day play out, you know, life where people are just really working hard every day, trying to make a living.\\n\\nBLOCK: Why was that interesting to you as an actor?\\n\\nHALL: I mean, I've seen that my whole life, you know? - my mom, my family. And I don't know. It was an interesting thing to play, like, all the subtleties of what life is emotionally every day. And that - it was very specific because, most of the times, we really aren't - in movies, we see people play what they feel, you know? You feel something. But in real life, we really don't, you know? Many of us go to work. And we have someone home sick. Or we don't know how we're going to pay this bill or that. But, you know, we don't wear that - just kind of is simmering in the midst of a million other thoughts - just stuff. And, you know, I loved that it wasn't about that. And yet all of that is in what life is and in Lisa.\\n\\nBLOCK: I want to ask you about something that the director of Girls Trip, Malcolm Lee, is quoted as saying about you. He says you're definitely black famous. And I wonder what you make of that?\\n\\nHALL: Well, that's a good thing, you know? But, you know, I think with cable and Netflix and things that are on. And every time a movie crosses over, you know, those - that audience widens. But definitely having your core is - you know, I think it's kind of imperative. And so, hopefully, black famous is the beginning.\\n\\nBLOCK: That's Regina Hall. Her new film is Support The Girls. Ms. Hall, thanks so much.\\n\\nHALL: Thank you.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Republicans Wonder How, And If, They Can Pull The Party Back Together\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nIn a matter of hours on Jan. 6, the Republican Party went from shrugging off its loss of the White House to a party in crisis.\\n\\nIt was becoming clear just before the violent insurrection at the Capitol that the party had lost two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, making President Trump the first president since Herbert Hoover whose party lost the White House, the House and the Senate in one term. And plenty of Republicans blamed Trump for the Democrats' success in Georgia.\\n\\nTrump's own defeat means the GOP has failed to get a majority of votes in seven of the last eight presidential elections.\\n\\nNow, Trump leaves office as the only president to be impeached twice, and the House vote against Trump over the Capitol insurrection marked the most bipartisan impeachment in U.S. history.\\n\\nThe Republican fault lines go in every direction: between the grassroots and the establishment, between big donors and aspiring presidential candidates, between House leaders and Senate leaders.\\n\\nRepublican pollster Frank Luntz says he has seen intraparty battles before, but this one is so deep and so polarizing — and people are so passionate about it — I don't know how you heal it. I don't know how you bring these people together.\\n\\nThe biggest internal division right now, says Luntz, is between Republicans who voted for impeachment and voters who opposed it. He found in research this week that 43% of Trump voters say they would definitely vote against any lawmaker who supports impeachment.\\n\\nThat makes it impossible for Republicans to put together a majority by 2022, and in fact, that's a direct threat to the existence of the Republican Party overall, Luntz said.\\n\\nTrump's red line\\n\\nAt the Jan. 6 rally, Trump and his son, Don Jr., went even further, threatening a primary election defeat for any Republican who failed to back Trump's effort to have Congress overturn President-elect Joe Biden's election.\\n\\nThis isn't their Republican Party anymore, the president's son said. This is Donald Trump's Republican Party.\\n\\nAnd that's one of the reasons that, even after the violent insurrection at the Capitol, two-thirds of House Republicans and a total of eight senators voted to throw out some of the election results.\\n\\nThose votes show an even deeper, more fundamental rift in the party, says Stuart Stevens, a former Republican consultant and current adviser to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. He thinks the big divide is between authoritarians and those who believe in democracy.\\n\\nI think it's just a straight-up red line, said Stevens. This is so much greater than any differences over tax policy or trade policy. It's a fundamental belief in whether or not you want to continue the American experiment. A large portion of the Republican Party has decided they are for democracy if that means they win, and they're against it if it means they lose. Which is to say, you don't believe in democracy.\\n\\nThese splits are playing out not just on Capitol Hill but among Republicans all over the country.\\n\\nJean Evans, the former executive director of the Missouri Republican Party and previously a state legislator, resigned at the end of last year partly due to pressure from within the GOP to back Trump's efforts to overturn the election.\\n\\nThe demands that we stand up and support Trump and facilitate these sorts of actions became increasingly hostile and frightening, Evans said. And then when I saw the president tweeting for everyone to come to D.C. on the 6th, I thought, 'What is he doing?' \\n\\nIn Missouri, just like nationally, polls show vast majorities of Republicans believe the lie that the election was stolen from Trump.\\n\\nThe party is split between those who accept reality and those who don't, a problem that Evans thinks only Trump can fix.\\n\\nFor the party to move forward, the best thing that could happen really would be for Trump to speak to his supporters and tell them that he accepts the results [and] they should, too, she said.\\n\\nSurvival mode\\n\\nTrump has condemned the violence at the Capitol, but he hasn't acknowledged that Biden won legitimately. Barring that, Stevens thinks, the only solution is for voters to reject Republicans just like they rejected Trump.\\n\\nYou have to beat them, he said. The United States Capitol was taken over by a terrorist gang of cop killers, and the Republican Party still has not come to grips with what that means. If you can be president of the United States, incite a riot to oppose a legal election and take over the Capitol, and that's not a high crime and misdemeanor, I'm not sure what is.\\n\\nBut other Republicans think the party can heal itself.\\n\\nRalph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, says the party has and will continue to reject violent actors, but that it has to work with those who believe the lie that the election was stolen.\\n\\nThey're going to have to be accommodated, and they're going to have to find a way, if they want to be effective, to hewn off some of the rough edges, Reed said. But our attitude needs to be one of welcoming, not pushing them away.\\n\\nPushing away those who are supremely loyal to Trump would seem to be out of the question, since they represent such a big chunk of the party's base. But Reed thinks the party can address their concerns and convince them that in a democracy, it's possible for the Republican Party to lose a legitimate election.\\n\\nPolitical parties have a very strong instinct for their own preservation. So, when a political party is taking a position that marginalizes it, it tends to self-correct, he said. It evolves, it adapts, it becomes what it has to become in order to win and therefore survive.\\n\\nRegardless of how, or whether, the Republican Party resolves its internal splits, the process will take time, says pollster Luntz: You have a segment of American society that does not accept the election outcome and is going to continue to speak up, is going to continue to agitate. And that's going to make this a very unstable period for months and perhaps even years.\\n\\nThat means a long, unstable period not just for the Republican Party, but for the American political system as a whole."}
{"original": "Legacy Of Travel Ban Will Be Hard For Biden To Erase\\n\\nPresident-elect Biden has pledged to quickly end the Trump administration's travel ban on Muslim-majority countries. But immigrant advocates say the lasting effects of policy will be harder to undo.\\n\\nNOEL KING, HOST:\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is expected to sign a bunch of executive orders when he takes office tomorrow, including one rolling back the so-called travel ban on immigrants from majority-Muslim countries. But that policy's legacy won't be easy to erase. Here's NPR's Joel Rose.\\n\\nJOEL ROSE, BYLINE: After fleeing civil war in Syria, Haitham Dalati and his wife made it to the U.S. in early 2017. They hoped their daughter and her family would soon follow. But when I talked to Haitham Dalati a year later, the rest of the family was still stuck in Lebanon.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\\n\\nHAITHAM DALATI: This is so horrible for us. So I don't know now whether America is good or bad.\\n\\nROSE: Dalati and his wife got into the U.S. during a brief window when the first version of President Trump's travel ban was put on hold. In the months that followed, legal battles raged until the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a slimmed-down version of the ban. It wasn't until November of last year, though, that Dalati's daughter, son-in-law and four grandchildren were finally allowed in as refugees.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).\\n\\nROSE: The family hugged and wept at the airport gate in Pennsylvania. When we spoke again this month, Dalati said he sees America with new eyes.\\n\\nDALATI: Much better than before when my daughter is with me with her children and husband. Really, it's another America.\\n\\nROSE: Now, tens of thousands of families are hoping for similar reunions. Legally, experts say it should be easy for President-elect Biden to end the travel ban on day one as he's promised. The policy was created by executive order, and it can be reversed much the same way. But immigrant advocates say the hard work is still ahead.\\n\\nAVIDEH MOUSSAVIAN: It's not just what they can do with the stroke of the pen. As important as that is, it's just simply step one.\\n\\nROSE: Avideh Moussavian is with the National Immigration Law Center, one of many nonprofit organizations that have fought what they deride as the Muslim ban. Moussavian says the Biden administration needs to assure immigrants that they will be treated fairly and that immigrants who've been rejected for visas and green cards under the travel ban should get another chance - people like Pamela Raghebi.\\n\\nPAMELA RAGHEBI: I miss him. I need those arms holding me tight, making me laugh.\\n\\nROSE: Raghebi has been separated from her husband for more than two years. Her husband Afshin Raghebi was born in Iran and lived in the U.S. illegally for years. They met in Seattle, where she lives as a U.S. citizen. After they got married, he applied for a green card, but his application was denied.\\n\\nRAGHEBI: At that point, we were devastated.\\n\\nROSE: Under the rules, Raghebi's husband had to fly to Abu Dhabi for an interview at the U.S. consulate. They knew it was risky because of the travel ban, but she says they were trying to do the right thing. Now he's stuck overseas.\\n\\nRAGHEBI: It's an insult, but we will keep trying.\\n\\nROSE: Immigration hard-liners, though, say it would be a mistake to end the travel ban completely. Jessica Vaughan is with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower levels of immigration. She says the travel ban puts pressure on foreign governments in countries like Iran, Syria and Libya to improve their own security vetting for travelers to the U.S.\\n\\nJESSICA VAUGHAN: The burden should be on these countries to show that their systems are adequate, and their situations haven't changed all that much.\\n\\nROSE: But even some national security experts say banning all travelers from a country wasn't the answer. It just fueled a narrative that the U.S. discriminates against Muslims. Elizabeth Neumann was a top counterterrorism official in the Trump administration until she resigned last year.\\n\\nELIZABETH NEUMANN: These bans damaged our nation's reputation. They were an unnecessary distraction from the actual security enhancements that were needed.\\n\\nROSE: Neumann says the travel ban tarnished the U.S.' image around the world - one more part of the ban's legacy she hopes the Biden administration will begin to undo.\\n\\nJoel Rose, NPR News, Washington.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF EMANCIPATOR'S BLUE DREAM)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "HHS Civil Rights Office Tackles Health Care Discrimination Of People With Disabilities\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\\n\\nCivil rights officials at the Department of Health and Human Services issued a series of actions to protect people with disabilities from health care discrimination by medical providers during the pandemic.\\n\\nThe actions, by the Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, at the Department of Health and Human Services, specifically address discrimination related to the denial of treatment for people with disabilities who have COVID-19 or the symptoms of COVID-19. They include:\\n\\nThe start of a process to write regulations that explicitly prohibit medical workers from denying care to people with disabilities based on subjective decisions about the quality of their life or by issuing a Do Not Resuscitate order without the patient's consent or against their stated preference.\\n\\nA revision to the guidelines of four health care systems, in North Carolina, North Texas, Southwest Texas and the Indian Health System, to assure that people with disabilities and older people are not passed over for scarce care, like drug treatments and ventilators.\\n\\nThese problems were the subject of a series of NPR stories about how people with disabilities were denied ventilators and other pandemic care in Oregon. NPR's stories were cited in OCR's proposal.\\n\\nWe said during COVID-19, our civil rights are not suspended, HHS OCR director Roger Severino told NPR. People will not be subject to age or disability discrimination when the going gets tough.\\n\\nSarah McSweeney, whose death was the subject of one of NPR's stories on health care rationing, was a 45-year-old woman with multiple disabilities. She died at an Oregon hospital in May after doctors questioned her quality of life and pressured her guardian and others who cared for her to sign a Do Not Resuscitate order to allow doctors to withdraw care.\\n\\nThe new OCR action makes clear that doctors cannot issue a blanket DNR and cannot substitute their subjective beliefs about the quality of a disabled person's life over the person's own wishes.\\n\\nSeverino says the actions are intended to make clear that discrimination against persons with disabilities will be absolutely forbidden and stereotypes about their usefulness should never be part of a discussion when we allocate care.\\n\\nIf the OCR action — which takes on a range of issues of discrimination — becomes formalized, it would become a significant expansion of disability civil rights law.\\n\\nSeverino's office wanted to make a formal rule but could not get the action through all of the steps of the approval process before the end of the Trump administration. Instead, it was issued as a request for information, which is usually an appeal to stakeholders for information to help make a rule.\\n\\nBut a final rule exists in draft form, according to a source at HHS, with hopes that new Biden Administration officials will pick it up.\\n\\nAlison Barkoff, of the Center for Public Representation, a disability civil rights group, said the OCR actions reflect parts of the disability agenda that President-elect Joe Biden had promised in his campaign.\\n\\nThis is a great signal and we're really pleased, says Barkoff, who helped write more than a dozen complaints to OCR about treatment of people with disabilities during the pandemic\\n\\nIn addition, OCR announced four settlements over what are called state crisis standards of care. These are guidelines by state governments to health care providers about how they can determine who gets medical care if it gets scarce. The rules are guidelines for events like natural disasters, terrorism or pandemics.\\n\\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, disability groups across the country filed complaints with OCR, claiming their state's guidelines allowed doctors and hospitals to deny care to people with disabilities and the elderly. OCR had already announced several previous settlements with states, including ones with Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Utah over policies to triage care including decisions about who gets a ventilator.\\n\\nSome state standards, for example, allowed scarce care to be denied to people with moderate dementia, or who used portable ventilators, even though many people who use ventilators to help them breathe still hold jobs and live full lives.\\n\\nThe final four agreements — including in Texas where hospital staff say they are facing shortages in the latest spike of the coronavirus — include language to guarantee doctors will not pressure patients to sign Do Not Resuscitate orders and not exclude people from treatment based on their disability alone.\\n\\nThe steps taken by OCR to stop medical discrimination reflect the findings of a series of papers on bioethics and disability, issued by the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency that makes recommendations to Congress and the White House on disability policy. Those reports alleged widespread discrimination in medical settings against people with disabilities — from who gets organ transplants to how bias that disabled people can't have a good quality of life is used to deny medical treatment.\\n\\nDisability discrimination in health care is among the most insidious — with life and death consequences — and it's hard to root out, Neil Romano, chairman of the National Council on Disability told NPR.\\n\\nThe action by OCR, he says, sends an unequivocally clear message that we will not accept health care that relegates people with disabilities to last in line or 'lost cause.'"}
{"original": "Regulators Draw Up New Rules To Stop Abusive Practices By Debt Collectors\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP\\n\\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is drawing up new rules that would curb abusive debt collection practices, which it says generated some 85,000 consumer complaints last year alone.\\n\\nThe rules would limit the number of times debt collectors can contact borrowers to collect debts, and require them to substantiate that they have the right person before doing so. They would also have to make it easier for borrowers to dispute debts.\\n\\nBoth consumers and responsible businesses stand to benefit by improved standards for debt collection. Consumers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and businesses should be able to operate fairly and reasonably to collect the debts they're legitimately owed, said Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, at a field event in California.\\n\\nThe bureau says it receives more complaints about the $13.7 billion debt collection industry than any other issue. Many consumers report being harassed repeatedly to pay debts they don't owe, or have already paid, the bureau says.\\n\\nThe basic principles of the proposals we're considering are grounded in common sense. Companies should not collect debt that is not owed. They should have more reliable information about the debt before they try to collect, Cordray said.\\n\\nOne problem is that many companies purchase debt from creditors for pennies on the dollar, with the intention of aggressively trying to collect it, but don't necessarily have correct information about the borrower or even whether the debt has been paid, he said.\\n\\nThe proposals would limit the number of times a company could contact a borrower and prevent the company from using certain channels of communication, such as a work phone, if the borrower requested it.\\n\\nDebt collection is already governed by the 1977 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The bureau was given the authority to issue new regulations under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill of 2010.\\n\\nBureau officials say the 1977 act needs to be updated in numerous ways.\\n\\nFor instance, the act gave consumers the right to dispute a debt or ask for more information, but few consumers understand they may do so, Cordray said.\\n\\nUnder the proposed rules, companies would be obligated to confirm their information about debts if consumers requested it.\\n\\nThe proposed rules are being released to the public for comment and will be rewritten in greater detail, after industry and consumer groups weigh in.\\n\\nThe law should protect and promote ethical debt collection, which safeguards the rights of consumers and provides clear and effective rules of the road for collectors, said James Mastriani, president of Velocity Recoveries, a debt collection firm.\\n\\nBut, he added, The law should not be misused to enable borrowers to turn legitimate loans into de facto gifts. In the long run, this will reduce the availability of credit for all consumers and make credit more expensive.\\n\\nGraciela Aponte-Diaz, director of California policy at the Center for Responsible Lending, said the proposals endorse the common-sense idea that people should not be harassed for debts they do not owe.\\n\\nBut she expressed concern that some parts of the proposals don't protect consumers from unwarranted collection attempts.\\n\\nSpecifically the proposal does not go far enough to require that debt collectors adequately document that they are pursuing the right person for the right debt, she said."}
{"original": "What The Latest Immigration Polls Do (And Don't) Say\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\\n\\nAmericans could be forgiven for having poll whiplash this week.\\n\\nShock poll: Americans want massive cuts to legal immigration, said a headline from the Washington Times.\\n\\nAmericans broadly embrace the Democratic immigration position, declared a Washington Post headline, with the release of a new ABC/Washington Post poll.\\n\\nOn immigration, as on any other issue, it can seem that there's a poll result that supports just about any position. Here's a look at immigration polls to explain what findings are shaky — and to highlight what can reasonably be concluded about Americans' views on immigration.\\n\\nQuestion wording matters\\n\\nDeputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley touted a Harvard Harris poll on Morning Edition Tuesday, saying that it showed Americans support the president's agenda.\\n\\nIt's an 80-percent issue, people want to close down the borders, he told NPR's Rachel Martin. It's a 70-percent issue to end chain migration. [A] 68-percent issue to end the visa lottery program and ask people to come here on merit. That's a 70-percent issue. And this is a study from Harvard.\\n\\nFirst things first — there's a lot more to these poll numbers than Gidley is saying.\\n\\nThat Harvard Harris poll didn't find that 8 in 10 Americans want to close down the borders. Rather, it asked Americans, Do you think we should have basically open borders or do you think we need secure borders?\\n\\nGiven the choice between open borders — a position that no mainstream political leaders are proposing — and a secure border, which is current U.S. policy, 79 percent of Americans agreed that the U.S. needs secure borders.\\n\\nIt is true that 68 percent of Americans said they oppose the lottery that randomly picks 50,000 people to enter the U.S. each year for greater diversity. And in fact, even more (79 percent) favored merit-based immigration over family-based migration, based on a question asking whether immigration priority for those coming to the U.S. should be based on a person's ability to contribute to America as measured by their education and skills or based on a person having relatives in the U.S.\\n\\nBut then, that question provides an argument for using education and skills as a factor (ability to contribute to America) but not for using family ties. That may have swayed respondents toward the merit-based choice.\\n\\nIt's also possible that the question gave some respondents the idea of a false choice, said one immigration researcher.\\n\\nIt shouldn't have to be an either-or, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based immigration think tank.\\n\\nIt's possible, he added, for a system to incorporate both merit and family ties.\\n\\nYou can have both — you get more points for having higher education, you get more points for knowing English, you get more points for having a close relative, he said.\\n\\nI think what they're saying here is merit should have more of a preference than relatives, said Mark Penn, codirector of the Harris Poll. I don't think we polled a full battery of specific chain migration policy here. I would read this as saying that you see the public backing limits on the idea of family-based immigration, he added.\\n\\nRight now, both family- and skills-based immigration exist in the U.S., though far more — around two-thirds — is based on family ties, according to Capps. Meanwhile, around 15 percent of admissions to the country are related to jobs and skills. On top of that, there are diversity visas, visas for investors who create jobs and allowances for refugees.\\n\\nThe numbers shift heavily depending on how the question is asked, however. In a Morning Consult/Politico poll from August 2017, there was a question asking if there should be a greater emphasis on an applicant's job skills over their ties to family members.\\n\\nFifty-six percent either strongly or somewhat supported this, while 42 percent opposed it. That's still a majority who favor merit over family, but it's a smaller majority.\\n\\nThat poll asked these questions still other ways, though. For example, when the poll separated out different potential factors, several had strong support. Fully 60 percent of Americans said that ties to family members in the United States should be a factor in determining who should get to legally immigrate to the U.S. The poll also found that 57 percent believe education should be a factor, and that 54 percent believe professional or academic achievement should factor in.\\n\\nIn other words, when it's not presented as an either-or choice, Americans appear to have a more nuanced view on family-versus merit-based immigration.\\n\\nWhat Americans do seem to believe\\n\\nAmericans' support on any given issue can jump around over time, and depending on when and how the questions are asked, the answers can be interpreted any number of ways. But based on an array of reputable polling, here are a few reasonable conclusions to draw.\\n\\n1. Americans support letting DACA recipients stay.\\n\\nThat latest poll from the Washington Post found that 87 percent of Americans support a program that allows undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States if they arrived here as a child, completed high school or military service and have not been convicted of a serious crime. An NBC News/Survey Monkey poll released Tuesday likewise found that 66 percent of Americans support the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) policy, which protects those who were brought into the United States as undocumented children from being deported.\\n\\nThere's a more than 20-point gap there, but these two results do join months of poll findings showing that find that a majority of Americans support the idea behind DACA, allowing children brought to the U.S. illegally to stay in the U.S.\\n\\n2. Americans aren't that wild about a wall. (A different kind of fence, however ...)\\n\\nJanuary polls from Quinnipiac, Pew, ABC News/Washington Post, CNN and CBS all find that around 6 in 10 Americans oppose building or expanding a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\\n\\nThat said, all of those polls asked about building a wall specifically. But the definition of wall is fluid. While Trump has long advocated for a border wall, he has also said that in some places on the border, natural barriers would take the place of that kind of barrier. And Republican senators recently said that the wall would be more of a fence.\\n\\nBut that Harvard Harris poll didn't find such strong opposition to a border barrier. It found that 54 percent of Americans support building a combination of physical and electronic barriers across the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nIt could be that some Americans oppose a wall but believe in using a mix of resources as border barriers. It could also simply be that the word wall is at this point so politicized that some Americans instinctively oppose it while still wanting more of a barrier at the border.\\n\\n3. Americans are divided on legal immigration levels, but are more in favor of decreasing than increasing them.\\n\\nFor decades, Gallup has asked Americans if they think the level of legal immigration should be kept at its present level, increased, or decreased. In recent years, Americans have been closely split between holding steady (38 percent as of June 2017) and decreasing (35 percent). The remainder, around 1 in 4, want to increase legal immigration.\\n\\nWhile the clear majority want to decrease or hold legal immigration steady, these numbers represent a longer-term pro-immigration shift — as of the mid-1990s, two-thirds of Americans wanted to decrease legal immigration, and only 6 or 7 percent wanted to increase it.\\n\\nThe Politico/Morning Consult poll asked it a different way, asking how they'd feel about halving the number of legal immigrants over the next 10 years. It didn't offer the option for holding it steady, just varying degrees of support or oppose. Nearly half, 48 percent, strongly or somewhat supported cutting legal immigration in this way; 39 percent opposed it (the rest didn't know or had no opinion).\\n\\nOnce again, there's no majority here, but more people wanted to cut legal immigration than grow it.\\n\\nThe Harvard Harris poll tried the question yet another way: In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year? It then provided a series of choices: zero to fewer than 250,000, 250,000 to 499,999 and so on up to 2.5 million or more.\\n\\nIt's hard to know how to interpret the results of that question without the context of current immigration levels. As of 2016, the U.S. accepted nearly 1.2 million new legal permanent residents, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Of those, just over half were new arrivals. The rest of people received changes in status — for example, some might have been refugees who became legal permanent residents.\\n\\nThe poll found that 72 percent of people chose some number under 1 million, which might suggest that those people want to reduce legal immigration. But then, the question didn't provide them with current immigration levels. There was no way for many of them to know what direction they were arguing for immigration to move in. As a result, this is one way that this poll's results may have been misleading."}

From globalization to religious tolerance, identity to climate change, our conversations seek to capture this moment and how we're shaped by it — as individuals, nations and as a global civilization.\\n\\nIn 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\\n\\nTo borrow King's imagery in 2017: Which way is the arc of our history bending?\\n\\nThat's a big question we're posing at NPR. We can't easily report on the future, but we can ask smart people how they think we got to this point in history, and where they think we're going.\\n\\nIt's a vital conversation at this transformative moment in our political and social order, here and around the world. Depending on where you stand, we're experiencing either a long-needed course correction or a feeling that the world has lost its way. Whatever your view, the rate of change has been dizzying.\\n\\nSo what is really going on? We're asking a diverse group of thinkers to help chart what amounts to the history of our time.\\n\\nThese conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.\\n\\nListen: NPR's interview with Francis Fukuyama Listen · 6:54 6:54\\n\\nListen: NPR's interview with Mary Robinson Listen · 7:15 7:15\\n\\nIn another conversation, Ireland's former president, Mary Robinson, warned of a strange moment in history. Much of the world had committed itself to very strong multilateral institutions, but she says, we seem to be now going into identity nationalism in a narrow sense. Identity nationalism, concludes Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, is almost hopeless — and it boils down to fear of change.\\n\\nTechnological change is intensifying. We're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something, he says. And cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.\\n\\nListen: NPR's interview with Mohsin Hamid Listen · 7:19 7:19\\n\\nRecently we heard from an adviser in the Trump administration. Michael Anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the National Security Council. He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was The Flight 93 Election. Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope.\\n\\nIn his conversation with NPR, Anton was a bit more gentle in his description of the world situation. His new boss, he says, views Britain's exit from the European Union as both a hopeful sign and as a reassertion of nationalist sentiment.\\n\\nListen: NPR's interview with Michael Anton Listen · 7:00 7:00\\n\\nWe want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not, Anton says.\\n\\nAnton spoke just as Trump was nearing his first 100 days in office — and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve.\\n\\nTrump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.\\n\\nIn the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. Will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? Maybe not, but it's worth trying.\\n\\nWeb producer Heidi Glenn and Morning Edition editor Jacob Conrad contributed to this report."}
{"original": "In Africa, War Over Water Looms As Ethiopia Nears Completion Of Nile River Dam\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Nabil/AP Amr Nabil/AP\\n\\nA new mega-dam being built by Ethiopia on the Nile River is threatening to spark a war over water and shift political influence in northeastern Africa.\\n\\nEthiopia sees the dam as the key to its economic future, but its neighbor to the north, Egypt, fears the dam could spell doom for its water supply, says BBC Africa correspondent Alastair Leithead. The Nile supplies nearly 85 percent of all water in Egypt, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\\n\\nThe $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam would tower over 500 feet and will generate more than three times the amount of energy produced by the Hoover Dam in the U.S. When completed, it will be the largest dam in Africa and will generate up to 6,450 megawatts of energy.\\n\\nEgypt has had control politically of the Nile for millennia, Leithead tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson. And suddenly Ethiopia has now come along — in the middle of the Arab Spring, they started building this dam — now they can, if they want, to control the flow. They say that's not what this is about.\\n\\nAccording to the World Bank, about 75 million Ethiopians or three-quarters of the population currently lack access to electricity. The country predicts the energy produced by the mega-dam will help put people to work, Leithead says. Industry growth in the region is a priority because the United Nations predicts the population of Africa will double by 2050.\\n\\nIt's not about control of the flow, but providing opportunity for us to develop ourselves through energy development, Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia's Minister for Water, Irrigation and Electricity, told the BBC.\\n\\nBut Ethiopia's dive head first into the project has real implications for Egypt's water supply. The United Nations is already predicting that Egypt will experience water shortages by 2025.\\n\\nThe pharaohs used to say about Egypt that it was the gift of the Nile, Leithead says. They used to worship the river as a god. And they now see a country upstream with a big tap that if they want to, they can turn off that river's flow.\\n\\nThe dam could exacerbate shortages because as the reservoir behind it fills up, the Nile's water levels could drop by 25 percent for up to seven years, the Geological Society of America estimates.\\n\\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is pressing Ethiopia to slow down the timeline for filling up the reservoir, but talks between the two countries are stalled, Leithead says.\\n\\nThe mega-dam could both politically and economically transform the Horn of Africa. For some countries downstream, like Sudan, it will provide cheaper electricity, and will help regulate the river's water levels, which are prone to yearly flooding. But Sudan's support could potentially disrupt a 1959 treaty with Egypt that allocates the Nile's waters between the two countries.\\n\\nIf Egypt 'loses' Sudan — the only country it has a water allocation agreement with, and the only Nile riparian country which can pose significant threats to waters flowing downstream due to its high irrigation potential — that would be extremely risky for Egypt, Ana Cascão, an expert on the politics of the Nile, told Foreign Policy.\\n\\nEthiopia's drive to complete the project, which the government is funding entirely, echoes the attitude of Egypt when it built the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s, Leithead adds.\\n\\nYou look back at the old footage from a few decades ago in the '60s when Egypt was building the Aswan High Dam, and you see the kind of nationalism, the kind of, 'We are behind this project. This is us as a country doing something dramatic,' he says. That is what Ethiopia is doing right now."}

How much is riding on Monday night's Iowa caucuses, especially for those three candidates?\\n\\nBROOKS: Not much (laughter). You know, it'll winnow the field, but Iowa's become more polarized and more unrepresentative. So I'm - I'm a believer this thing is going to go on till April, May. And so, you know, this'll be a chapter. And it will be a chapter where I suspect - and this is my bold prediction - I can continue my consistency in being wrong - that we will report on Tuesday that Trump and Sanders underperformed. I think that it's just risky having a big part of your support being nonvoters. Nonvoters tend to not vote, and I think that's going to happen.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Do you still believe in the wisdom that they always cite in Iowa that there are three tickets out of Iowa? If you come in first, second or third, you're still alive.\\n\\nBROOKS: I think it'll be five. Just out of 11, you can't cull that much. If you look at the polls, I'm wildly over-interpreting the last three days - three or four days of polls. But Trump and Cruz have been sinking, and Cruz really got hit, I thought, in the debate. And Rubio and some of the others have been rising. Even Ben Carson has been rising. And so I think if that momentum continues, it may not look as clean as a Cruz-Trump race as it does right now.\\n\\nSIEGEL: And, E.J. Dionne in Iowa, according to Nielsen, more than 12 million people got to watch a GOP debate minus Trump. Do you think that debate is likely to affect the outcome?\\n\\nDIONNE: Well, I think the big question about the debate, as David suggested, is whether Cruz, who got hit very hard during that debate, was hurt by it because I think that Iowa really, really does matter to Ted Cruz. I think he needs to win here to go on. And he still has a decent shot because he has some of the most important evangelical organizations. And I was down near the Missouri border in a town Keosauqua City - a little city where you saw some supporters of the socially conservative candidates who were really lagging - Santorum and Huckabee and Ben Carson - coming behind Cruz, at least in that area, because they see him as the person closest to them who can beat Trump. If for some reason Trump actually wins this, I think it becomes much harder for Ted Cruz to return - to go on. I think, similarly, it is very important to Bernie Sanders to win here because his chances over the long-haul, I think, depend on having a one-two punch against Hillary Clinton - winning here and winning in New Hampshire. And the one advantage Hillary Clinton has at this point is, a couple of months ago, she was expected to sweep here. Now, it's much closer. You can argue that the Clinton people shouldn't have let it get away from them. But in letting it get away from them, they lowered the bar on what counts as victory. I think a couple of votes will be enough.\\n\\nSIEGEL: I think, months ago, we all expected that, on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, we'd be talking about Hillary Clinton. I don't think we expected we'd be talking about Bernie Sanders. So the question is, what do we make of this phenomenon? David, what do you make of Sanders?\\n\\nBROOKS: You know, Robert Putnam wrote a book called Our Kids. Charles Murray wrote a book called Coming Apart. It's about how the country is bifurcating along class and other lines. And we - a lot of us read those books and thought they were really important. But, at least in my case, I didn't make the connection to the presidential race as much as I should have. And the coming apart of the country and the segmentation of the country has affected both parties, and that's one of the reasons Bernie Sanders is doing so well - because he represents the disaffected people, or at least speaks about the disaffected people in the working class, as does Donald Trump. And Hillary Clinton, if you watch her and Bernie Sanders back-to-back, Sanders just talks with so much authenticity and force, and Clinton has not been able to match that. It's too much calculation and hesitation.\\n\\nSIEGEL: E.J., Bernie Sanders likes to cite somebody else who went into Iowa and who surprised everyone, surprised Hillary Clinton - Barack Obama. Is he another Barack Obama?\\n\\nDIONNE: I think the big - the big talk here is, is Bernie Sanders closer to Howard Dean in '04, where Dean generated a lot of energy in the antiwar left of the party? A lot of volunteers came in for Dean, and it turned out he didn't have the depth on the ground. Or is he Barack Obama? I think it's already very clear that Bernie Sanders is stronger than Howard Dean in 2004. And the question is, how close does he get to where Barack Obama is? I think Dean - Sanders, rather - speaks for a very odd feeling a lot of Democrats have toward the president, which is they approve of him; they're happy he's there, but they still wish, at times, that he had been more progressive and had taken on the Republicans harder. And I think Sanders speaks for that and speaks for an idealism among the young that's really captured in that ad where - called America, which uses the Simon and Garfunkel song and really doesn't have any words at all. It doesn't have any words about policy in it at all. It's about a feeling of change.\\n\\nBROOKS: Yeah, and I would say that on both sides there's a debate about systemic thinking. Barack Obama came in promising to change the system and clearly did not, as he himself admits. How do you change the system? Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump promise some sort of abstract systemic change. I happen to think there's a lot of magical thinking there. Clinton is more - I'll be a fighter within the system. So it's, how do you change the basic structures of power?\\n\\nSIEGEL: But when you contrast, on the one hand, the Republican rage at Washington and, on the other hand, Bernie Sanders calling for Washington to take over all healthcare and, presumably, to start regulating public colleges and universities to compensate them for lost tuition costs. That's a lot of political energy for a couple of completely irreconcilable views of the federal government. Is it - is it just the polarizing effect of the nominating process, David, or are we that divided as a people?\\n\\nBROOKS: We're that divided. There's a lot of Mars and Venus going on. On the other hand, the parties - Sanders and Trump say it's more about the organization of hatreds than the actual delivery of policy. And who are you against? You're against Wall Street. You're against the establishment. Both parties share that. And I would say, finally, I do think there's a lot more flexibility about government. People are feeling hurt, and they're willing to let government - even some Republicans, if it'll give them a hand up.\\n\\nSIEGEL: That's all the time we have. David Brooks - I'm sorry, E.J. - David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and author - also author of Why The Right Went Wrong. Thanks to both of you.\\n\\nDIONNE: Good to be with you.\\n\\nBROOKS: Good to be with you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Opioid Use Lower In States That Eased Marijuana Laws\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post/Getty Images Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post/Getty Images\\n\\nMedical marijuana appears to have put a dent in the opioid abuse epidemic, according to two studies published Monday.\\n\\nThe research suggests that some people turn to marijuana as a way to treat their pain, and by so doing, avoid more dangerous addictive drugs. The findings are the latest to lend support to the idea that some people are willing to substitute marijuana for opioids and other prescription drugs.\\n\\nMany people end up abusing opioid drugs such as oxycodone and heroin after starting off with a legitimate prescription for pain. The authors argue that people who avoid that first prescription are less likely to end up as part of the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nWe do know that cannabis is much less risky than opiates, as far as likelihood of dependency, says W. David Bradford, a professor of public policy at the University of Georgia. And certainly there's no mortality risk from the drug itself.\\n\\nThe National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says there's good evidence that cannabis is effective at treating pain for some conditions. So Bradford and three colleagues — including his scientist daughter — decided to see whether people who can get easy access to medical marijuana are less likely to get prescription opioids. The answer, they report in JAMA Internal Medicine, is yes.\\n\\nThere are substantial reductions in opiate use in states that have initiated dispensaries for medical marijuana, he says.\\n\\nThe researchers studied data from Medicare, which mostly covers people over the age of 65. (It was a convenient set of data and available to them at no cost.) They found a 14 percent reduction in opioid prescriptions in states that allow easy access to medical marijuana.\\n\\nThey estimate that these dispensary programs reduced the number of opioid prescriptions by 3.7 million daily doses. States that allowed homegrown marijuana for medical use saw an estimated 1.8 million fewer pills dispensed per day. To put that in perspective, from 2010 to 2015 Medicare recipients received an average of 23 million daily doses of opioids, the researchers say.\\n\\nBecause opioid use nationwide was rising during the study period, their estimate of reduced uses reflects a slowing of the increase, rather than an actual decline in opioid use in these states, Bradford says.\\n\\nThe analysis found a correlation and can't prove that marijuana use led to a reduction in the growth of opioid use. There might be other factors at work.\\n\\nEven so, the findings suggest that expanding access to medical marijuana could help ease the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nHefei Wen at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health was lead author on another study in the same journal that reached similar conclusions. Wen, with Jason Hockenberry at Emory University, used Medicaid data. Medicaid is primarily a health insurance program for low-income people.\\n\\nThe authors write that laws that permit both medical marijuana and recreational marijuana for adults have the potential to reduce opioid prescribing for Medicaid enrollees, a segment of population with disproportionately high risk for chronic pain, opioid use disorder and opioid overdose. Nevertheless, marijuana liberalization alone cannot solve the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nBradford agrees that medical marijuana laws could have a role to play. But it is not without risks, he says. Like any drug in our FDA-approved pharmacopeia, it can be misused. There's no question about it. So I hope nobody reading our study will say 'Oh, great, the answer to the opiate problem is just put cannabis in everybody's medicine chest and we are good to go.' We are certainly not saying that.\\n\\nOne concern is marijuana use might encourage people to experiment with more dangerous drugs. Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, authored a study that found marijuana users were six times more likely than nonusers to abuse opioids.\\n\\nA young person starting marijuana is maybe putting him — or herself at increased risk, Olfson says. On the other hand there may be a role — and there likely is a role — for medical marijuana in reducing the use of prescribed opioids for the management of pain.\\n\\nThis is a question of balancing risks and benefits. And that's difficult to do with the current studies based on broad populations — and in this case, populations that are not representative of the at-risk population as a whole.\\n\\nOlfson says what they really need is studies that follow individuals, to see whether marijuana use really does supplant opioids. It's hard to do a study in this area because the federal government regards marijuana as a very dangerous drug and puts tight controls on research.\\n\\nThat does make this a difficult area to study, and that's unfortunate because we have a large problem with the opioid epidemic, Olfson says. And at the same time, with an aging population, we have lots of people who have pain conditions and who will benefit from appropriate management.\\n\\nYou can contact Richard Harris at rharris@npr.org."}
{"original": "Trump Administration Vows 'Biggest Tax Cut,' 'Largest' Overhaul In History\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eric Thayer/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated 9:45 a.m. ET\\n\\nThe White House is banging the drums that President Trump is doing something big again ahead of his 100th day in office — unveiling a tax plan.\\n\\nThis is going to be the biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country, Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said at a panel Wednesday morning.\\n\\nBut what's coming out later Wednesday afternoon are guidelines, not legislation, akin to what would be revealed in a campaign. Though there's no sign Congress is ready to take this up immediately, Mnuchin made it sound urgent, saying the administration wants to move as fast as we can.\\n\\nThe guidelines do set out the president's priorities, so let's take a peek:\\n\\n1. First, what's in it?\\n\\nA few things:\\n\\n--15 percent business rate: The headline is a 15 percent business tax rate. That cuts the corporate tax rate down from 35 percent.\\n\\n--Small businesses would benefit: It would include companies that don't pay through the corporate tax code, but for private businesses that pay through the income tax code (39.6 percent at the top). So that means small businesses would see a big cut.\\n\\n--Trump himself stands to gain tens of millions: This plan would be a windfall for Trump. He pays taxes for his businesses through the income tax code, so his plan would slash his own tax liability potentially in half, saving himself tens of millions of dollars.\\n\\n--Modest middle-class cuts: There would also be tax cuts across the board, including a modest one for those considered middle class.\\n\\n--Fit on a postcard? Trump's Treasury secretary said this plan would seek to simplify the tax code by allowing people to fill out their taxes on a large postcard. While people always like the idea of making it easier to fill out their taxes, they might not like what benefits they'd potentially lose. It could mean doing away with popular deductions like the home mortgage deduction, something that back in December Mnuchin said Trump's plan would scale back.\\n\\nPolitics Trump's Platform Remains Unclear As President Reaches 100 Days Trump's Platform Remains Unclear As President Reaches 100 Days Listen · 5:16 5:16\\n\\n2. How is this paid for?\\n\\nIn one ambiguous word: growth.\\n\\nWe fundamentally believe we can get to 3 percent sustained economic growth, Mnuchin said Wednesday morning.\\n\\n(Trump actually promised 4 percent during the campaign.)\\n\\nExperts predicted during the campaign that Trump's various iterations of his tax plan would blow a hole of trillions of dollars in the budget, even bigger than the Bush tax cuts.\\n\\nThat was true even using dynamic scoring, which takes growth into account.\\n\\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, for example.\\n\\n--No BAT, man: Part of how House Speaker Paul Ryan wanted to pay for this (and it would still only be part) was through what's formally called a border-adjustment tax, or BAT. It's basically an import tax. But the Trump administration's early embrace of the BAT landed them in political hot water. Why? An import tax would mean a lot of things Americans buy at grocery and retail stores would go up.\\n\\nThat why it's being left out, because it's seen as too controversial right now. The last thing Trump wants is to have the narrative hijacked and turned into how he's proposing to increase the cost of everyone's avocados.\\n\\nBut, once again, it's another revenue source shut off.\\n\\n3. If the BAT was Ryan's idea, what kind of buy-in does President Trump have from Republican leadership in Congress?\\n\\nAfter the failed health care bill, the White House has been trying hard to show it is taking the lead on this one.\\n\\nTrump wouldn't own Trumpcare (or was it Ryancare?), but this tax overhaul is all him. For now, Republican leaders are saying they're OK with that (at least publicly).\\n\\nWe all agree on the benefits of tax reform and the place we want to land, and the question is how you reach that place, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. We continue to have productive discussions with the administration about all ideas on the table.\\n\\nIn other words, that's a nice way of saying this is at the infant stages. Congress still has to write and pass a bill. A tax overhaul hasn't been done in 30 years, and there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who will want their hands on this.\\n\\n4. Is there anything in this plan for Democrats?\\n\\nThere aren't a lot of details, but Politico and the Wall Street Journal report that what's unveiled Wednesday will include infrastructure and child-care tax credits that have been pushed by Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump.\\n\\nThose were priorities during the campaign, but they weren't attached to a tax plan. It's an attempt to paint Trump as bipartisan in trying to get Democrats on board since those are measures they'd likely have some measure of support for — although the details are always what matter.\\n\\nBut a tax overhaul, which again hasn't been done in 30 years, is hard enough without attaching a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and a $500 billion child-care tax credit.\\n\\nDemocrats certainly don't want to couple those programs with tax cuts they feel overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. You didn't hear much of anything about working families, Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden told Politico. I'm certainly not going to support a tax proposal that gives crumbs to working families and cakes to the fortunate few.\\n\\nEven Republicans are skeptical they can put them together. It's probably going to end up being, in the end ... a Republican-only exercise, John Thune said in the same story.\\n\\nSo at this point, all of this appears to be another show for Trump's public relations ahead of the 100-day marker, one he's calling a ridiculous standard, while at the same time launching a website touting all of his accomplishments.\\n\\nThere are many, many questions about the feasibility of this plan, and you can be almost guaranteed it will change quite a bit before there's any vote to make any of it law.\\n\\nThere's a long way to go."}
{"original": "Disaster Preparedness Expert Explains What We Know About COVID-19 And Coronavirus\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nWe're going to begin right now talking about what we know so far about coronavirus. Dr. Irwin Redlener is the director of the National Center of Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, and he joins us now. Good morning.\\n\\nIRWIN REDLENER: Good morning.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Just quickly, I want to get your response to what we've seen happen at airports overnight - people crammed for up to seven hours waiting to get through Customs and Immigration because of screenings. How does that look from a disaster preparedness point of view?\\n\\nREDLENER: Yeah. Well, you know, what what's happening now in general - I'm going to get to the airports in a second - is that we're getting recommendations from public health experts about what we need to do to control the spread of this virus and keep people from getting sick. But then we have the reality of the practical implications of virtually every single decision that is made, for example - how many people should be in a crowd, who should be screened coming back into the United States, what should we do about domestic airports - I mean domestic flights, which also...\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Many questions.\\n\\nREDLENER: Yeah. I mean, this - the policy that may seem like the good idea, the right strategy when we're sitting around our, you know, conference tables - which we shouldn't be doing anyway right now - but when we do, we'll say, OK, well, we're going to close the schools in a particular community - which we may need to do in all communities. But the implications of such a, you know, announcement or new policy has tremendous hardship connected with it. And the same with the airports - if we have backups and backlogs of people waiting to get screened, that means we got a lot of people hanging around together, which is sort of the exact opposite of what we'd prefer people do in terms of separating from others and avoiding close contact.\\n\\nSo this is really where we have the clash of the academics versus the realities of people's lives and the economy. And you know, we're worried about all aspects of this. This is why one of the things I've been very concerned about is that a lot of these policy decisions are being made by, you know, state and local political leaders who are really struggling to figure out how they should respond to whatever news there is about the current status of the coronavirus.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's right. It - there seems to be a lot of people doing a lot of different things in different places. And the public is confused, quite frankly.\\n\\nREDLENER: They're extremely confused. And I think that what we're going to have to do is figure out a better way of getting communications from the federal government. You know, I've been - and many of us been deeply concerned about the messaging that's coming from the top. You know, so - and I think what we're going to have to do is figure out how we're going to manage this lack of consistent information that's coming from federal officials.\\n\\nSo you know - and let me give you a couple of examples. So we have the mayor of Seattle saying no crowds bigger than 250. We have the mayor of New York saying no crowds bigger than 500. We have Israel - the whole country of Israel using a way lower number to limit people - the size of people - the number of people who can gather in any place at any time. And this is...\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So...\\n\\nREDLENER: ...Deeply problematic. Yes.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is the - I mean, we don't have much time. But what is the right answer? I mean, we're getting more and more news about the coronavirus. We're trying to figure out what it is, what it does, who is most at risk.\\n\\nREDLENER: And you know - exactly. And we haven't even talked about the readiness of America's hospitals to accommodate what is going to be an onslaught of patients for the next few weeks is what many of us are predicting. So we're kind of flying by the seat of our pants in a situation where we need a lot more guidance, a lot more consistency from the federal government. We're watching these press conferences where we're getting all kinds of opinions, a lot of happy talk about how things are under control. And it's a serious problem - one of the more serious social problems that the United States has faced in memory.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Irwin Redlener. He's the director of the National Center of Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. Doctor, thank you very much.\\n\\nREDLENER: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Despite Shutdown, Trump Administration Continued Effort To Expand Alaska Oil Drilling\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Judy Patrick/AP Judy Patrick/AP\\n\\nOverflowing trash cans and vandalism in national parks managed by the Interior Department have become a symbol of the ongoing partial government shutdown. The agency has announced it is taking what it calls the extraordinary step of using money from entrance fees to pay for cleanup.\\n\\nBut, despite the shutdown, the Trump administration is continuing work on one of Interior's biggest, most controversial priorities: opening up more Arctic lands in Alaska to oil drilling.\\n\\nThe Bureau of Land Management, an agency under the Interior, has gone ahead with a series of public meetings on its effort to expand oil development in the 22-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.\\n\\nE-mails obtained by Alaska Public Media show that on January 3 — two weeks into the shutdown — a BLM employee was contacting Alaska community leaders to schedule meetings related to oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Congress legalized drilling in the refuge just over one year ago, after decades of opposition from conservation groups.\\n\\nWhen contacted last week by Alaska Public Media, the employee's email account sent an automatic reply: Due to the lapse in funding of the federal government budget, I am out of the office. I am not authorized to work during this time, but will respond to your email when I return to the office.\\n\\nFollowing public outcry and a letter from a Democratic congressman after Alaska Public Media's report, the Bureau of Land Management this week announced it is postponing the Arctic Refuge-related meetings.\\n\\nThe letter came from the new chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, a Democrat who strongly opposes to oil development in the Refuge.\\n\\nThe work for gas and oil continues, despite the shutdown, despite fact that people are not being paid, despite the fact that our parks are suffering, Grijalva said in an interview.\\n\\nIn his letter, Grijalva wrote that he thinks holding meetings to advance oil development with limited public communication during the shutdown raises transparency issues.\\n\\nMoreover, Grijalva is demanding more details on how Interior is paying for the work. He thinks the agency may be violating a federal law that limits government spending before Congress appropriates funding.\\n\\nOthers are asking the same question.\\n\\nThe administration seems to be in a grey area, legally, said Matt Lee-Ashley, who served as deputy chief of staff at Interior under the Obama administration and is now with the left-leaning Center for American Progress. At least in the past administration, the lawyers in the Department of Interior were crystal-clear that civil servants weren't to be doing activities where there was no clear appropriation from Congress, and made clear there were criminal penalties associated with that.\\n\\nInterior officials declined to be interviewed for this story. But in a letter responding to Grijalva sent Thursday, Brian Steed, Interior's deputy director for policy and programs, wrote that the agency consulted with its solicitor's office and determined the work was legal using money from a previous fiscal year, as long as a limited number of staff were involved.\\n\\nThe planning process for both of these efforts are critical to the state of Alaska and the nation, Steed wrote.\\n\\nGrijalva's colleagues in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee say they support Interior's actions. That committee is chaired by Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who championed the legislation that opened a part of the Arctic Refuge for oil development known as the 1002 Area.\\n\\nOne of Interior's essential missions is producing energy for the good of the country, a spokeswoman for the committee said in a statement. What they're doing to advance development in the NPR-A and 1002 Area is fully legal, a top priority, and we strongly support it.\\n\\nBut Interior's continuation with the public planning process to advance oil development in Alaska during the shutdown has led to confusion.\\n\\nSuzanne Little, an officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts who serves on an advisory council for the Bureau of Land Management, had been planning to fly to two Arctic communities last week to attend the scheduled public meetings about the National Petroleum Reserve. But with the shutdown, she wasn't sure if the meetings were still happening. After repeatedly trying to reach her contact at the agency, she cancelled her plane tickets.\\n\\nHours later, Interior sent an email saying they were going forward, after all.\\n\\nLittle was able to reschedule her flight and made the meetings. But, she said, it was very frustrating that there was nobody to answer phones in the office, yet the meetings were going to continue."}
{"original": "'Black Panther' Is A Superhero Story You Haven't Seen Before — And It's Thrilling\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios\\n\\nIn 1938, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster — two Jewish kids from Cleveland who were reading the alarming news coming out of Europe — created precisely the hero necessary to put things right: an impossibly strong and nigh-invulnerable paragon of virtue and butt-kicking they called Superman. He could have ended Hitler's advance with a snap of his fingers — and he definitely would have, if only he weren't a creature of pure fantasy. Three years later, as the Nazi threat escalated, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby went a step further, summoning into being a hero who was essentially an American flag come to dynamic, Hitler-punching life. They called him Captain America, because subtlety is not what superhero comics are about.\\n\\nThere's a poignancy in the fact that these two heroes were products of grim necessity — a global menace threatened our way of life, and a nation gripped by fear and anxiety found in Superman and Captain America twin release valves. By indulging in the belief that someone big and strong and primary-colored could rescue them and beat the bad guy, Americans managed to steal a few moments of vicarious satisfaction.\\n\\nThere was a hole in the world, so they created heroes to fix it.\\n\\nThat same poignancy permeates Black Panther, which is Marvel Studio's 18th superhero movie, though it certainly doesn't feel like it. Ryan Coogler's third film is, happily, no by-the-numbers, big-budget hero narrative of the sort to which we've grown inured — it's by turns as intimate and immediate as 2013's Fruitvale Station and as stirring as 2015's Creed.\\n\\nChadwick Boseman is T'Challa, king of Wakanda, an unimaginably advanced, ruthlessly isolationist African nation that hides its riches and its tech from the world at large. Wakanda, as vividly and gorgeously realized here, is a soaring Afro-futurist utopia powered by the world's rarest, hardest and blue-glowiest metal, vibranium. (Fair warning: If one were to sneak a flask into a screening of Black Panther and drink every time any character says the word vibranium, one would spend the film's final hour in the lobby having one's stomach pumped by a team of professionals.)\\n\\nIt's a credit to the production team that, even after 18 times at-bat, we're still finding innovative way to visualize superhero tech (this time out, it's a kind of Matrix-meets-Magic-Sand sort of deal), and still turning out fight choreography and stunts capable of quickening even the most jaded pulse (a nighttime car chase through the streets of Busan, South Korea, includes a moment engineered to elicit cheers, because Coogler knows what these films are about).\\n\\nPlus there are war rhinos, so. I mean.\\n\\nAs for the story, it is a truth universally acknowledged that wherever there is a palace, there must be palace intrigue: T'Challa's claim to the throne is challenged by Michael B. Jordan's fabulously monikered Killmonger, who manages to mong quite a few kills before facing off against his rival. Like all of the best villains, Killmonger's motivations are grounded in his zeal to correct a great injustice — one may quibble with his master plan's methodology (i.e, the wholesale slaughter of billions), but you gotta admit: Dude has a point.\\n\\nThe Walking Dead's Danai Gurira, as Okoye, leads Wakanda's elite corps of female warriors, the sight of which in combat provides many of the film's most thrilling moments. Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's wry and brilliant younger sister, supplies the kingdom with its tech, and the film with its laugh lines. Lupita Nyong'o plays a love interest who's actually interesting — a young woman who chafes against Wakanda's age-old policy of hoarding its wealth and tech from the world. Angela Bassett is on hand, along with her cheekbones, to look regal and fierce in costume designer Ruth E. Carter's royal couture.\\n\\nThere's also a couple of middle-aged white dudes (Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis) doing stuff somewhere in the background, but never mind, the film isn't about them.\\n\\nWhich, of course, is truly what's new here.\\n\\nThe genre of superhero cinema is wider and deeper than many give it credit for, because the stories we've seen thus far have followed similar arcs, starring similar actors, in similar settings. In Black Panther, Coogler, too, rounds the familiar bases: Yes, those T'Challa versus Killmonger scenes do duly check the Hero Fights Evil Version of Himself box; yes, you've seen elements of that car chase before; and yes, the sudden but inevitable death of a supporting character does inspire T'Challa to scream NOOOOOOO! because that's the law.\\n\\nBut in a much more crucial way, Black Panther is a story we haven't seen told before in popular cinema — a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.\\n\\nIt's a fantasy, in other words — but then, that's exactly what superhero stories are for. It's difficult to explain the simple, inspiring and empowering joy of seeing a version of oneself onscreen, to those who've spent their lives unthinkingly soaking in it. A key reason for Wonder Woman's runaway success last summer was that moment she climbed out of that trench, revealed herself to the world, withstood an onslaught of machine-gun fire and proceeded to get Amazonian on some enemy soldiers. Male heroes have been doing something similar for decades, in and out of spandex, but now, women in the audience got the chance to feel the raw and blissfully uncomplicated power of representation and understand what the nerds in their life saw in this silly stuff. Black Panther is filled with similar moments: a pan-African cast getting hero moment after hero moment in a gorgeous Afro-futurist setting where the light is always golden, and the tech is always glowy.\\n\\nThere is a hole in the world, a big one. And although one movie, one fictional hero, can't fix it, it can tell a story — a new story — that millions have hungered for."}
{"original": "Trump And The Military: What An Erratic Commander In Chief Leaves Behind\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nDonald Trump campaigned hard on military issues.\\n\\nHe vowed to bring endless wars to a close, rebuild the fighting forces and compel allies to pay their fair share, saying the U.S. would no longer be suckers.\\n\\nThat message resonated among voters and helped propel him to the White House in the 2016 election. Among troops, he seemed to enjoy fairly strong support. A Military Times poll showed that 46% had a favorable view of him at the start of his term, 10 points higher than President Barack Obama had in January 2017.\\n\\nStill, Trump was unable to end those endless wars. He leaves a military that is still fighting and advising in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, though in smaller numbers.\\n\\nHe provided a significant budget boost, made the troops more ready and created a U.S. Space Force. NATO members did end up paying more for their defense — for many years a source of official Washington grumbling — though there were fractures within the alliance over Trump's abrasive nature and abrupt decisions, such as withdrawing troops from Afghanistan without consulting NATO leaders.\\n\\nBut in the end, several analysts say, what stands out is the damage Trump did to civilian-military relations. He used troops — and senior officers — in clearly political events, at times referring to my generals. One senior officer, who is not authorized to speak publicly, recalled that in his dealings with Trump, the president was surprised to learn the military is apolitical.\\n\\nMoreover, Trump brushed aside a military justice system that found service members guilty of war crimes, granting them pardons.\\n\\nTrump was constantly undermining civilian-military relations around the bounds of what is acceptable behavior, says Peter Feaver, a Duke University professor who focuses on those relations. This, combined with the fact that he has a tin ear for all things in the civil-military domain, means that Trump did lots of damage to this crucial pillar of the republic.\\n\\nAaron O'Connell agrees. He was a Marine Corps officer who served in Afghanistan and in Obama's National Security Council.\\n\\nThe biggest thing, says O'Connell, who now teaches at the University of Texas, is Trump's pardons for Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher and Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance. Both were convicted of war crimes by the military.\\n\\nThey were not close calls on the merits, O'Connell says. Why get involved with this? It only hurts the military, hurts the rule of law and hurts the image of the U.S. as a law-abiding nation.\\n\\nTrump also tested civilian-military relations by urging that active-duty troops be used to quell street protests following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police last year.\\n\\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper strongly and publicly opposed such a move, saying it was a job for local police and possibly the National Guard. Trump soured on Esper after that, and their relationship never survived. Months later, Esper was terminated by Trump in a tweet.\\n\\nTrump's willingness to use the military against legitimate protests in America [last] year stands out as particularly significant and damaging, says Carter Malkasian, a former senior Defense Department official. The backlash was thankfully great, so hopefully our institutions have emerged undamaged.\\n\\nMichael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, acknowledged he is no Trump fan, seeing him as an extremely dangerous commander in chief and citing his saber rattling and his threatening a war with North Korea.\\n\\nBut O'Hanlon sees Trump's overall legacy as relatively positive.\\n\\nThe increase in budgets, readiness levels and modernization efforts will be sort of like a 'mini Reagan period,'  O'Hanlon says. Fifteen years of war and several years of budgetary dysfunction had left things frayed.\\n\\nBrad Bowman, a defense analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, credits the Trump administration with prioritizing military research and development with the largest budget increase ever, saying the Pentagon recognized the growing technological prowess of China and Russia as well as the changing character of warfare.\\n\\nTo its credit, says Bowman, the Trump administration explicitly shifted the Pentagon's focus to great-power competition, meaning China and Russia, no longer making anti-terrorism efforts a priority. That came through a National Defense Strategy crafted by Trump's first defense secretary, James Mattis.\\n\\nMackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute says the three-year Trump bump defense increases were significant and helpful, particularly to restoring readiness.\\n\\nBut not nearly enough to completely rebuild the military, she says, as he claimed in his State of the Union address [last] year.\\n\\nEaglen also says that despite the increases, Trump's souring on those who disagreed with him — including Defense Secretaries Mattis and Esper — was one of the big reasons Trump could not oversee the buildup of the Navy during his tenure, a buildup that would have reflected the focus on Asia and the growing threat from China.\\n\\nShe also faults Trump for using Pentagon money to build his wall on the border with Mexico. Such action, Eaglen says, sets up the budget to be raided by any future president for any self-declared 'emergency.' \\n\\nTodd Harrison, a budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, echoed those concerns, calling the shift in funds for the wall one of the worst legacies of the Trump years.\\n\\nI think Congress will need to rethink many of the provisions it routinely puts into law, says Harrison, that allow the president to reallocate certain types of funding in a crisis without prior approval from Congress.\\n\\nDespite Trump's talk of building up the military, some analysts say he's overstating his efforts.\\n\\nObama in his first term spent more than [Trump] did, says Larry Korb of the Center for American Progress. Obama spent $3.3 trillion on the military in his first term, Korb points out, compared with $2.9 trillion during Trump's term.\\n\\nMoreover, Trump's claim of a military that was lagging under Obama was not the case, Korb says. Back in the summer of 2016, retired Gen. David Petraeus and O'Hanlon wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled, The Myth of a U.S. Military 'Readiness' Crisis, saying there were areas of concern but no crisis.\\n\\nOne retired senior officer who served under three presidents and who asked not to be identified because he still works in government says in the end Trump was someone who in the national security realm was chaotic and transactional, often tweeting policy changes.\\n\\nSuch tweets announced that all troops would be withdrawn from Syria — a decision that angered both U.S. Special Forces on the ground and their Kurdish partners fighting the remnants of the Islamic State. In the end, Trump was convinced by military leaders to keep hundreds of troops to continue the fight — and protect oil fields.\\n\\nNo one could trust that what he said was true — the old 'your word is your bond' didn't hold true with the president, the retired officer adds.\\n\\nOn Afghanistan, Trump was successful in getting a U.S.-Taliban peace deal that would mean the withdrawal of all American troops by this spring, as long as the Taliban agreed to abide by certain conditions, such as breaking with al-Qaida and not attacking cities. That would mean America's longest war — at 19 years — would come to an end.\\n\\nIt's hard to see how the February 2020 agreement with the Taliban would have come about without Trump's drive to get out, not to detract from [U.S. negotiator] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad's diplomatic skills, says Malkasian, the former Pentagon official.\\n\\nKorb, of the Center for American Progress, said removing U.S. troops from Afghanistan made sense — but not the way it was handled by the administration.\\n\\nTrump ordered reductions in U.S. troop levels from 4,500 to 2,500, even though military officials wanted to maintain that higher number into 2021. Military officials privately acknowledged that the Taliban had failed to meet the conditions called for in the agreement, but it appeared Trump was intent on maintaining a campaign pledge to bring the troops home.\\n\\nBoth Afghan officials and NATO allies were caught off guard by the reductions. And when acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller made the troop cut announcement in the Pentagon briefing room, he swiftly left without answering any questions.\\n\\nTrump's constant policy by tweet and abrupt decisions, with little deliberation among officials and allies, left others to handle the fallout.\\n\\nMilitary and some civilian leaders have been in constant damage control over the last four years, the retired officer says. The old 'cleanup on aisle 4, then 6, then 8.' \\n\\nAnd in the end, there were signs that those within the military were souring on Trump.\\n\\nA Military Times poll taken before the election showed that earlier 46% approval rating for Trump dropping by 8 points.\\n\\nRetired Adm. James Stavridis, the former top officer at NATO, says Trump will have a very mixed legacy. He was a strong advocate for funding the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs, but his crude language, his pardoning of war criminals and his sudden removal of troops will be remembered negatively.\\n\\nStrategically, the military will remember him as a very political commander in chief who basically wanted to pull back from our overseas commitments and international alliances — an approach not well regarded by many in the force, Stavridis says. To the degree there was a 'Trump Doctrine,' it seemed to be withdraw and come home."}

{"original": "Trump Economic Adviser Gary Cohn At Odds With Inner Circle\\n\\nGary Cohn was a dyslexic kid from an immigrant family in Cleveland who rose to lead Goldman Sachs. Now he's becoming perhaps the most powerful voice for economic policy in the Trump White House.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nLet's meet the man President Trump turns to for advice on economic policy. His name is Gary Cohn and he's head of the president's National Economic Council. Trump will be getting advice from Cohn and that group today as he turns from health care reform to the next big item on his domestic agenda, a big overhaul of the tax code. Gary Cohn is a just-retired president of Goldman Sachs. Those Wall Street roots, and also his moderate stances on social issues and trade, put him at odds with others in the president's inner circle. NPR's Chris Arnold brings us this profile.\\n\\nCHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Gary Cohn took an unusual path to Goldman Sachs and the White House. Cohn's dyslexic, and teachers told his parents not to expect much. As a kid, he helped out at his family's electrical contracting business in Cleveland. He went on to business school. Then he was floundering around, and he decided what he really wanted to do was to work on Wall Street. So one day on a trip to New York, he went down to a commodities trading floor, and he just stood around outside the security checkpoint.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGARY COHN: And I hear a gentleman say, I got to run. I'm going to the airport.\\n\\nARNOLD: That's Cohn telling the story during a commencement speech.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCOHN: I jump in the elevator with him and say, I overheard you're going to the airport. Do you mind if I share a taxi with you?\\n\\nARNOLD: The guy worked for a financial firm, and he agreed. And on the ride, Cohn tried to get the guy to give him a job, even if that meant bending the truth a bit.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCOHN: He says, what do you know about options? I told him, I know everything. He said, great. I want you to come back Monday. I want you to interview. I'm trading options. It's a brand-new market that's opening, and I don't know how to trade it. And I said, no problem. I'm your guy.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOHN: Literally got home Friday night. The first stop on the way in from the airport was the bookstore. I bought the...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOHN: I bought the McMillan Options As A Strategic Investment book and read it four times - as I said, dyslexic guy - read it four times over the course of the weekend, came back in and interviewed and was offered a job. And that's how I started in my financial services industry.\\n\\nARNOLD: Now, despite his working-class roots, in some ways, Gary Cohn represents everything that many Trump voters hate. He's a registered Democrat. He's reportedly been a voice for gay rights in the White House. He's also now a super rich former Wall Street executive who supports free trade and globalization. Those are things that, during the campaign, Trump basically blamed for ruining America. But after seeing the more extreme and fringy advisers surrounding the president, more centrist watchers of the economy were relieved to see Trump pick Cohn as his top economic adviser.\\n\\nMICHAEL DRISCOLL: Cohn is going to be perceived as the adult in the room.\\n\\nARNOLD: Michael Driscoll worked on Wall Street for 25 years and is now a finance professor at Adelphi University. The populist rhetoric from Trump has made many economists nervous that he might start a damaging trade war. But...\\n\\nDRISCOLL: One thing about Wall Street executives is they're going to be pragmatists, all right? You know, Cohn and some of the other people that come from the world of finance are going to be much more aware of what the implications are for the U.S. and the global economy and for the markets.\\n\\nARNOLD: So Driscoll says he's happy to see that Cohn's in the president's inner circle. But critics say, while all that may be true, Cohn is also putting Wall Street ahead of Main Street. Cohn stood by the president's side as he signed an executive order that in effect suspends a rule from the Obama administration, a rule that says financial advisers need to act in their client's best interest. Here's Cohn on CNBC.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, SQUAWK ON THE STREET)\\n\\nCOHN: The rule was completely misintended. They were trying to protect investors in their retirement accounts, but by protecting investors, they highly limited their choices.\\n\\nARNOLD: But that limiting-choice language is telling, say supporters of the rule, which include the AARP and scores of other retiree and consumer groups. They say that argument is just a bogus industry excuse. Phil Angelides is the former head of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.\\n\\nPHIL ANGELIDES: This is the big lie they tell. They want to tell Americans their choices are being limited. The rule does nothing of the sort.\\n\\nARNOLD: Cohn and the Trump administration have also said they want to attack the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and other regulations. Angelides says to him it looks like they want to go back to the way things worked before the financial crisis.\\n\\nANGELIDES: Gary Cohn is walking out of Goldman Sachs into the government with a payout that's going to be close to $300 million. And so he looks at the system that existed before the financial crisis. He thinks it worked just fine.\\n\\nARNOLD: Angelides says, for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs, it didn't, and he hopes that Cohn and the administration won't be able to gut the reforms that were passed after the worst economic collapse in generations.

{"original": "Trump Defends School Prayer. Critics Say He's Got It All Wrong\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 6:30 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump on Thursday defended students who feel they can't pray in their schools — and warned school administrators they risk losing federal funds if they violate their students' rights to religious expression.\\n\\nTrump held an event in the Oval Office with a group of Christian, Jewish and Muslim students and teachers to commemorate National Religious Freedom Day. The students and teachers said they have been discriminated against for practicing their religion at school.\\n\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court banned school-sponsored prayer in public schools in a 1962 decision, saying that it violated the First Amendment. But students are allowed to meet and pray on school grounds as long as they do so privately and don't try to force others to do the same.\\n\\nTrump said the government must never stand between the people and God and said public schools too often stop students from praying and sharing their faith.\\n\\nIt is totally unacceptable, Trump said. You see it on the football field. You see it so many times where they are stopped from praying and we are doing something to stop that.\\n\\nThe group included William McLeod, a 9-year-old Utah boy who was forced to remove the cross of ashes from his forehead on Ash Wednesday. I just don't want anyone to feel like that, McLeod said.\\n\\nMalak Hijaz said her school failed to protect her from anti-Muslim bullying. I would bring the hijab to cover my hair and kids would make fun of me, harass me and attack me, she said. And I would tell the principal.\\n\\n'Real problem is just the opposite'\\n\\nA non-profit group called the Freedom from Religion Foundation said Trump was blurring the separation between church and state with his actions. It said there has been an increasing number of reports of schools promoting prayer in ways that cross the line — such as an Alabama high school where a student football team was baptized at school. The group has sent complaint letters to more than 500 schools during the past three years.\\n\\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the foundation, said Trump left the impression that there is this terrible suppression of religion expression, but she says the real problem is just the opposite.\\n\\nIt's about proselytizing to a captive audience, Gaylor said.\\n\\nTrump did not propose changes to existing law or regulations, but the White House says it wants to empower students and teachers to exercise their rights.\\n\\nThe Department of Education will send a letter to education secretaries and officials in all 50 states reminding them that students and teachers can't be discriminated against for practicing their First Amendment religious rights.\\n\\nThe administration updated 2003 guidance regarding prayer in public schools. The administration also plans to streamline and mandate a federal complaint process that students can use to alert authorities when they've been discriminated against.\\n\\nThe updated guidance states that teachers and other public school officials, acting in their official capacities, may not lead their classes in prayer, devotional readings from the Bible, or other religious activities.\\n\\nBut at his event, President Trump also praised and defended Joseph Kennedy, a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field after games.\\n\\nEvangelical support\\n\\nThe event comes as Trump works to shore up his support among evangelical Christians and other religious freedom advocates ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Last month, evangelical magazine Christianity Today ran an editorial calling Trump morally lost and argued that he should be removed from office.\\n\\nAfterward, the president promised to take action to safeguard students during a campaign rally at a Miami evangelical megachurch.\\n\\nThe updated guidance to schools is one of three actions the Trump administration is taking to support the free exercise of religion. In addition, nine federal agencies are releasing proposed rules to ensure religious organizations are not discriminated against by the federal government.\\n\\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget will also direct federal agencies to ensure that states and other recipients of federal grants don't discriminate based on religion.\\n\\nJoe Grogan, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said Trump's Oval Office event underscored the importance of religious freedom.\\n\\nWhenever the president of the United States draws his megaphone upon a subject, people will pay attention, Grogan said. It's important for all Americans, parents, teachers, administrators and citizens to understand that the First Amendment protects religious beliefs and protects people in expressing their spiritual life in the public square.\\n\\nNPR's Tom Gjelten contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Army 'Leans In' To Protect A Shooter's Brain From Blast Injury\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lance Cpl. Matthew Bragg/U.S. Marines/DVIDS Lance Cpl. Matthew Bragg/U.S. Marines/DVIDS\\n\\nFor the first time, the U.S. military is speaking publicly about what it's doing to address potential health risks to troops who operate certain powerful shoulder-mounted weapons.\\n\\nThese bazooka-like weapons produce forceful explosions just inches from the operator's head.\\n\\nThough several scientific reports over the past year have noted the possible risk, until now military officials have been reluctant to speak publicly about whether repeated exposure to these blasts might result in injury to a shooter's brain.\\n\\nTracie Lattimore, who directs the Army's traumatic brain injury program, agreed to an interview with NPR to talk about steps the military is taking.\\n\\nWe are leaning in and trying to do everything in our power to protect soldiers and service members while they continue to get their job done, says Lattimore, who works in the Office of the Army Surgeon General.\\n\\nShe describes a wide-ranging effort that's already begun and includes scientific research on troops' exposure to blast during weapons training, enforcing limits on the firing of certain weapons, and even looking into whether special helmets could help stop blast waves.\\n\\nThe Army also has plans to monitor service members' total blast exposure during their military careers, Lattimore says. And even as the Army starts to take preventive measures, some basic questions still need answers.\\n\\nIs blast exposure hurting service members or soldiers? she says. And if it is, what are those thresholds — and how can we home in on those? And then how can we modify our equipment or the way we operate to prevent injury?\\n\\nBlast exposure became a big issue for the military during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where roadside bombs posed a major threat to U.S. troops. The military realized that the blast from one of these bombs could cause a traumatic brain injury even if it didn't leave a scratch on a service member's body.\\n\\nWe were totally concerned about the enemy weapon and the impact of the enemy weapon on our soldiers, Lattimore says. Now, she says, military officials are turning their attention to the explosions from weapons fired by U.S. forces.\\n\\nThese weapons include the AT4 and Carl Gustaf, both of which fire rounds that weigh several pounds and are powerful enough to take out a tank. The blast from firing these weapons contains as much energy as the blast from a small bomb.\\n\\nThe risk to a person's brain comes from an invisible pressure wave generated by an explosive blast. This blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound as it passes through a person's skull. And scientists have shown that if the wave is strong enough, it can damage brain tissue.\\n\\nGunners say each blast feels like a punch to the face. And studies by the military show that service members who fire these weapons a lot can experience headaches, temporary memory loss, and other symptoms like those of a concussion.\\n\\nThere's no longer any doubt that the blast wave from a roadside bomb can inflict serious brain damage, says Dr. David Brody, a neurologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, where the military trains its health professionals and scientists.\\n\\nSeveral years ago, Brody used a special type of MRI to look at the brains of U.S. military personnel who'd been exposed to bomb blasts. Many of them had evidence of traumatic brain injury, according to a study published by his team in 2011.\\n\\nToday, the military recognizes the risk of brain damage from bombs, and has implemented a policy to identify troops exposed to blasts and remove them from combat until they have a chance to heal.\\n\\nBut the risk from weapons blasts remains a mystery, Brody says.\\n\\nThere is no consensus, he says. There is not a real solid understanding of what these blast exposures do, if anything.\\n\\nBut there is reason to suspect that lots of relatively small blasts from firing an antitank weapon might have the same effect on the brain as one big blast from a bomb\\n\\nThe model is football players, Brody says.\\n\\nStudies have shown that thousands of relatively minor head impacts during a player's career can cause the same sort of long-term brain problems associated with full-blown concussion. These include problems with memory and thinking, and an increased risk of developing dementia and a brain condition called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.\\n\\nBut the military doesn't know how many weapons blasts troops are being exposed to, Brody says.\\n\\nIf the service members are being exposed to thousands to tens of thousands of events, then we've got a very clear analogy to football, he says. If they're being exposed in their lifetimes to dozens or hundreds of events, then it's not analogous at all.\\n\\nTo find out how much blast exposure troops are getting from heavy weapons, the military is using a device known as a blast gauge.\\n\\nThe gauges got their first wide use in Afghanistan in 2011. The Army put wearable gauges on thousands of military personnel in an effort to record the intensity of blasts from roadside bombs.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the gauges also indicated that fairly strong blast waves were reaching the heads of some soldiers who fired heavy weapons like the AT4 and Carl Gustaf.\\n\\nThe Army says it eventually stopped using the gauges because it was hard to collect useful data in the chaotic environment of the battlefield.\\n\\nBut training offers a more controlled setting to study blast exposure, Brody says.\\n\\nThe scientific program going forward is to get blast gauges on these service members and measure their lifetime history of blast exposures, he says.\\n\\nThat is also the recommendation of an Army-commissioned report released in April by the Center for a New American Security.\\n\\nAnd the military is planning to use an updated version of the blast gauges in a major study of blast exposure that was ordered by Congress late last year, Lattimore says.\\n\\nAlready, she says, military researchers are using the devices to help troops avoid excessive blast exposure during weapons training.\\n\\nIf our researchers are out on a range and measuring exposure to a certain weapons system and they see a reading that is higher than what we anticipated, they can pause the training, she says, to figure out what the problem is and fix it.\\n\\nExamples like this show how dramatically the military view of blast risk from any source has changed, Lattimore says. We are in a different place now than we were five years ago or ten years ago, she says.\\n\\nBrody agrees. In the early days, there was a little bit of resistance to even acknowledging that there might be a problem, he says. And I do not see that now. The culture has changed so dramatically for the better, it's great to see.\\n\\nBut Lattimore cautions that the mission of the Armed Forces hasn't changed. So even though there's a desire to be maximally protective, she says, the military has a job to do in terms of preparing for war and going to war, and that is an inherently risky business."}

{"original": "Tillerson Meets With Chinese President To Wrap Up Asia Trip\\n\\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson had positive things to say about his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping Sunday.\\n\\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has wrapped up his first trip to China representing the Trump administration, and there was one issue that dominated the discussions - North Korea. To get an update on what was discussed and what it means, we're joined now by NPR's Anthony Kuhn in Beijing.\\n\\nGood morning.\\n\\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So did either the U.S. or the Chinese side suggest any new solutions to the North Korea issue?\\n\\nKUHN: Tillerson did not outline any new steps to take. He said there are still steps to take before North Korea is able to put a nuclear warhead on a missile capable of reaching U.S. territory. But he admitted things are getting very dangerous. And that was emphasized today when North Korea, in state media, reported that they had just tested a new high-thrust rocket engine, which could be used on such a missile.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: How concerned do you think the Trump administration is about these reports from North Korea? How seriously are they taking them?\\n\\nKUHN: I'm sure they're taking them very seriously because they don't have a lot of good options. The military option could be catastrophic. On the other hand, Tillerson noted that over the past 20 years, diplomatic solutions have not stopped the North Koreans from getting a bomb. And so there's serious concern as the clock ticks down towards this nuclear breakout scenario.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And obviously, to resolve this, China is crucial. We've heard, in the past, rhetoric from the Trump administration that takes aim at China. Some reports are describing, though, Tillerson as being more conciliatory towards China on this trip. Is that what you saw?\\n\\nKUHN: It is indeed. Tillerson met with Chinese President Xi Jinping today. And Xi thanked him and praised him for taking an upbeat view of U.S.-China ties. Both sides said they're looking forward to a meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi in Florida in April. And this was sort of surprising given the fact that Trump recently tweeted that China hasn't been very helpful with North Korea.\\n\\nIt also contrasts with Tillerson's remarks during his own confirmation hearing, for example, when he said that the U.S. might blockade China's man-made islands in the South China Sea. But I think a lot of people were really struck by some language that Tillerson used at a press conference on Saturday. Let's hear a piece of that.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Since the historic opening of relations between our two countries more than 40 years ago, the U.S.-China relationship has been guided by an understanding of nonconflict, nonconfrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So what was so intriguing about that statement?\\n\\nKUHN: Well, Lulu, because it was a near-verbatim repetition of China's vision of U.S.-China relations. And at the core of that vision is the idea that the U.S. must treat China as its equal. And generally, the U.S. is not ready to do that.\\n\\nSo some people may feel that either Tillerson gave away too much in order to please his Chinese hosts or that he failed to articulate U.S. policy, perhaps because the U.S. hasn't formulated a complete policy towards China yet.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So I guess the question is, what does this tell us about the relations with China under Mr. Trump?\\n\\nKUHN: Well, it shows us, again, that they're very contradictory. They've been oscillating between China-bashing, which Trump did a lot of on the campaign trail, and other talk that he knows China and he thinks he can cut a deal with them. It's a contradiction we've also seen in his Cabinet picks, which include some people who have been very hawkish with China and some which have very close ties to it.\\n\\nAnd so Chinese, understandably, feel that the Trump administration is very unpredictable. And that worries them because they don't need distractions. They're heading into a big leadership reshuffle this fall, and they want stable ties.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn joining us from Beijing.\\n\\nThanks so much.\\n\\nKUHN: You bet, Lulu.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BOARDS OF CANADA'S HEY SATURDAY SUN)\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "Supreme Court Revives Trump's Ban On Transgender Military Personnel, For Now\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Drago/Getty Images Al Drago/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated Jan. 23 at 11 a.m. ET\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has reinstated President Trump's order placing restrictions on transgender persons enlisting and serving in the military by granting a stay of two lower court injunctions that had blocked the president's policy. The justices voted 5-4, reflecting the high court's conservative majority.\\n\\nThe decision allows the Pentagon to prevent many transgender persons from joining or, in some circumstances, remaining in the military while the lower court rulings that had blocked the policy are appealed. The justices did not allow the Trump administration to leapfrog the appeals court, as it had requested.\\n\\nIn a statement Wednesday morning, the Pentagon said a fourth national injunction from a case in Maryland U.S. District Court remains in effect. The statement said the Department of Justice is seeking to lift that injunction as well in light of the Supreme Court's action. Until that happens, the transgender policy will not be implemented.\\n\\nThe two cases before the Supreme Court — Trump v. Karnoski and Trump v. Stockman — are currently working their way through the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\\n\\nIn both of those cases, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan would have maintained a stay on the ban, Tuesday's Supreme Court order reads.\\n\\nThe transgender ban is being revived more than a year after a federal court in Washington, D.C., first blocked it in October 2017. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that trans members of the military had a strong case that the president's ban would violate their Fifth Amendment rights, as NPR reported.\\n\\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit lifted Kollar-Kotelly's injunction earlier this month, concluding that the ban had been substantially revised by the time it was instituted by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in March 2018. But other federal courts had also ruled against the ban — and until Tuesday, those other injunctions remained in place.\\n\\nThe two outstanding cases come from California and Washington state, in the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction.\\n\\nPentagon rules\\n\\nUnder Trump's policy, transgender persons who have a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and who may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery are, with some exceptions, disqualified from military service.\\n\\nThe exceptions fall into four categories:\\n\\n1. The more than 900 active-duty members of the military who a Pentagon report says were diagnosed with gender dysphoria after June 30, 2016. On that date former Defense Secretary Ash Carter lifted a prior ban on transgender persons serving in the military. This group will be allowed to receive required medical treatment to transition and to serve in their preferred gender, as long as they are not deemed nondeployable for more than 12 months.\\n\\n2. Those who have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before entering the military.\\n\\n3. Those who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria after beginning their military service but do not require a change of gender.\\n\\n4. Those whom the Pentagon calls transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and who serve in their biological sex.\\n\\nDisqualified from serving in the military, according to a February 2018 memo from Mattis, are transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition. Mattis based his recommendations on a 2017 study he had ordered, in which a 2016 Defense Department survey estimates that about 1 percent of the active-duty force, or 8,980 service members, identify as transgender.\\n\\nStark contrast between two administrations\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign, which is involved in the Karnoski case in Washington state, condemned the Supreme Court's decision, saying it thrusts this administration's discriminatory agenda onto a military that clearly doesn't want it, and does so at the expense of transgender people's careers and service.\\n\\nTrump announced his ban abruptly in the summer of 2017, saying in a series of tweets that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\\n\\nThe decision seemed to take Defense Department officials by surprise, sparking confusion despite Trump's assertion that he had consulted with my Generals and military experts.\\n\\nThe tweets were followed by an official presidential memo in August of that year, which gave the defense secretary (and for the Coast Guard, the homeland security secretary) the discretion to determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military.\\n\\nTrump's ban was a sharp reversal of a Pentagon policy announced in June 2016, when Carter said, Effective immediately, transgender Americans may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military just for being transgender.\\n\\nThat Obama-era policy was hailed as ending an era of legal and professional limbo for transgender persons in the U.S. armed services; Carter said the decision was made out of a desire to attract all talent possible to serve in the military.\\n\\nAt the time, researchers at the Rand Corp. think tank estimated there were as many as 7,000 active-duty transgender service members, with up to 4,000 more in the reserves.\\n\\nBecause of that policy and the lower court injunctions, the first openly transgender persons were able to join the U.S. military on Jan. 1, 2018. But now their status is once again in jeopardy.\\n\\nTuesday's order states that restrictions on transgender persons in the military will remain in effect until the 9th Circuit rules on the policy. The stay would continue if the case is argued before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report."}
{"original": "For Many Black Voters, Trump's 'What Do You Have To Lose?' Plea Isn't Enough\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR\\n\\nUpdated at 7:10 p.m. ET\\n\\nLike a lot of people's grandmothers, Flonzie Brown-Wright keeps a candy jar in the living room of her single-story home, which is also adorned with potted plants and family photos.\\n\\nFor Brown-Wright, 74, this jar is a reminder of the absurd questions — questions with no real answers — that she and other African-Americans had to answer before registering to vote in Mississippi in the 1960s.\\n\\n'How many jelly beans in a pound of candy? ... 'How many feathers are on a chicken?' And I got a bar of soap somewhere – but anyway, how many bubbles in a bar of soap?' she recalled.\\n\\nBrown-Wright says you could pass or fail those tests on the whim of an election commissioner. She failed the first time, but eventually became election commissioner herself in nearby Madison County, Miss. — a groundbreaking achievement for a black woman in the Deep South in the late 1960s.\\n\\nNow Brown-Wright is not pleased with the current political climate she says Donald Trump is fostering — and she's not alone. Trump has been promising to help bring jobs and security to black neighborhoods. But his poll numbers with African-Americans are in the low single digits, and many say his message is insulting.\\n\\nBrown-Wright now gives workshops on voting rights at local colleges, where she takes her jelly bean jar and soap bar.I try and make it real for people so people understand clearly that this is not something that we're just making up. That was on the test, she said.\\n\\nIt's been in my lifetime that I could not register and vote freely. So when I contrast the then and the now, in many respects, this is not what we really fought for — in terms of the animus, in terms of the hate-filled slogans and rallies and all of that, she says.\\n\\nBrown-Wright says the Republican nominee is painting African-American communities with a broad brush, and insulting black voters with his rhetoric, which she calls a joke.\\n\\nLowering her voice to mimic Trump, she says, 'Uh, your schools are no good!' Is that a way to get a vote? 'You have no jobs!' It's just so condescending.\\n\\nBrown-Wright says despite Trump's claim that he's reaching out to African American voters – and his visit this week to Jackson, a majority-black city – his message does not seem genuine.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR\\n\\nA much younger generation of black activists in Jackson seem to feel the same about the Republican nominee the question he posted to African Americans recently: What do you have to lose?\\n\\nWe have a lot to lose, Avery Brown, a Jackson State University senior, said with a nervous laugh. I mean, I guess there's this notion that we're already so far on the bottom that we can't go any further down?\\n\\nBrown is an intern working on a voter registration drive at the Mississippi NAACP office in Jackson. She hopes to attend law school after graduation. Brown says at this point, given Trump's past statements about other minority groups like Latinos and Muslims, there's nothing Trump could say to win her vote.\\n\\nAnd for him to say that he just wants to make black communities better, but while at the same time putting us down, it doesn't add up. You can't make someone better while telling them that they aren't worth anything, or they don't have anything to lose, she said.\\n\\nFor their part, the Trump campaign offered a response from their director of African-American outreach, Omarosa Manigault. The Democrats continue to take the African-American community for granted. It is disconcerting that they would rather pander than formulate substantive policy plans that would actually improve conditions as opposed to continue down the current path of the last eight years, Manigault said in a statement.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR\\n\\nThe campaign also provided a response from African-American pastor Mark Burns, who campaigns frequently with Trump. In a statement, Burns said, Mr. Trump's critics are just that, critical. African-Americans aren't stupid, we are worse off than where we were eight years ago. We are, as a people, tired of being used by the Democratic Party. Black Lives don't matter to Hillary Clinton, Black Voting Power Matters to Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nAt the NAACP office in Jackson on Wednesday morning, several pastors and local leaders held a press conference to denounce Trump ahead of his campaign rally. President Derrick Johnson and others accused Trump of spreading intolerance, and being slow to disavow white supremacist support.\\n\\nJohnson pointed to the state's history of racial segregation and violence, saying that Trump clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history – a history that we know all too well.\\n\\nOn the other side of the city, Percy Glasper works in the kitchen at Fred's Soul Food restaurant.\\n\\nGlasper, who is African-American, says he's not offended by Trump. He thinks Trump is just making outlandish statements to drum up media attention.\\n\\nIt only makes his ratings go up. When you're in front of the camera, you do anything to get your shine on, Glasper says.\\n\\nGlasper is 40, and a father of four who says he doubts he will vote in November.\\n\\nI voted for Obama in the last election and me personally, I didn't see no result. I voted for Bush ... I still didn't see no result, he says. So I gotta get it myself, you know what I'm saying?\\n\\nGlasper says he just wants to make enough money to get out of Mississippi, take his kids on trips, and see the world — or at least, Seattle or St. Louis. He added that he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life."}
{"original": "U.S. To Ship Peanuts To Feed Haitian Kids; Aid Groups Say 'This Is Wrong'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dieu Nalio Chery/AP Dieu Nalio Chery/AP\\n\\nOn paper, sending surplus U.S. peanuts to feed 140,000 malnourished Haitian schoolchildren for a full year sounds like a heroic plan. Instead, it's united 60 aid groups that are urgently calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to halt a shipment containing 500 metric tons of peanuts, preventing the legumes from reaching Haiti.\\n\\nThe aid groups call it crop dumping and warn that it will deliver an economic blow to struggling Haitian peanut farmers. Critics say it's poor aid policy that will have long-term negative impacts on Haitian communities.\\n\\nThis is a country where peanut production is a huge source of livelihood for up to a half-million people, especially women, if you include the supply chains that process the peanuts, says Claire Gilbert, spokesperson for Grassroots International, a Boston-based nonprofit that supports food sovereignty.\\n\\nHow the USDA got stuck with a pile of peanuts stretches back to the 2014 Farm Bill, which included incentives encouraging American farmers to plant more. It worked. In 2015, growers harvested 6.2 billion pounds of peanuts, and that number is expected to go up another 20 to 25 percent this year. But all that extra planting has left the USDA holding the bag, with a hefty peanut surplus.\\n\\nTo unload some of the excess, the agency announced a few weeks ago that it would ship 500 metric tons of packaged, dry-roasted peanuts to schoolchildren in Haiti as part of the Stocks for Food program, a joint initiative between the Farm Service Agency, Foreign Agricultural Services and Food and Nutrition Services.\\n\\nA statement issued from the aid group Partners in Health did not mince words about the announcement: We believe this is wrong.\\n\\nThe well-known aid group has been working on health and nutrition issues in Haiti for more than 30 years, including a partnership with Abbott Laboratories to manufacture and distribute a product called Nourimanba used to treat severely malnourished children.\\n\\nWe're not talking about big business owners being put at risk by an input of peanuts, says Dr. Louise Ivers, senior health and policy adviser, Partners in Health. We're talking about small, very poor farmers that are very dependent on a single crop. We really believe the dumping, or donation, whatever your perspective, will have negative consequences.\\n\\nThe nonprofit groups aren't the only ones less than excited at the potential USDA donation. While the U.S. Agency for International Development declined to comment, a tweet from its Haitian office did not seem to support USDA's peanut plan.\\n\\nCalls and emails to the USDA and the department's Foreign Agricultural Service seeking further information on the shipment of peanuts were not returned. In a Washington Post Letter to the Editor, Alexis Taylor, deputy undersecretary for farm and foreign agricultural services at the USDA, says the peanuts will be part of a morning snack, and that donated U.S. bulgur wheat, green peas and vegetable oil are also part of hot meals currently distributed at Haitian schools.\\n\\nTo ensure this aid complements ongoing development assistance, the USDA is funding research by the World Food Program into the use of locally procured peanuts in emergency rations and in school food programs in Haiti, Taylor writes.\\n\\nMark Schuller, author of Killing with Kindness: Haiti, International Aid and NGOs, and an associate professor at Northern Illinois University,says it's a classic case of institutional silo mentality.\\n\\nThe USDA is doing what they've always done, which is to promote agri business. It wouldn't have occurred to them that this is a problem, he says.\\n\\nIt's not the first time U.S. ag policies have interfered with Haiti's food security. In the 1990s the Haitian market was flooded with U.S. rice, putting many small farmers out of business. To survive, many were forced to move to overcrowded Port-au-Prince, which was later devastated by the 2010 earthquake. Likewise, many worry that opening Haiti to U.S. peanut surpluses, even for humanitarian reasons, could have harmful and long-lasting ripple effects.\\n\\nEven one shock can have devastating consequences and can impact the long-term economic viability of families, says Ivers.\\n\\nThe importance of protecting Haiti's peanut crop cannot be overstated, says Gilbert.\\n\\nHaiti is in its third year of drought, but peanuts are a crop that is drought resistant, which makes this even more important, says Gilbert. When other crops fail, peanuts are what they're literally relying on to survive.\\n\\nUPDATE: After our story was published, USDA press secretary Catherine Cochran sent an email response. It reads, in part:\\n\\nWe recently donated the 500 metric tons of peanuts to Haiti in partnership with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and in coordination with the Haitian government. The donated peanuts will be used as morning snacks in USDA/WFP school feeding programs in vulnerable areas of Haiti where malnutrition is high. Before donating the peanuts, USDA worked with WFP to develop a distribution program to ensure that the donation would not negatively affect Haiti's domestic peanut market. To prevent leakage of the product into the marketplace, the peanuts are in individual bags (28 grams apiece), they are to be consumed at school only, and we are designing a strong monitoring and evaluation program with the WFP to ensure the peanuts benefit the kids who need them. Nearly a third of Haitian children suffer from stunting, and many students arrive at school in the morning without having eaten breakfast. Peanuts, as a traditional part of the Haitian diet, provide much-needed protein. WFP is working with to us look at future needs and best uses for available peanuts.\\n\\nClare Leschin-Hoar is a journalist based in San Diego who covers food policy and sustainability issues."}
{"original": "Fact Check: Donald Trump's Speech On Immigration\\n\\nPBS NewsHour YouTube\\n\\nAfter more than a week of seeming to change direction on immigration policy, and then apparently turning back to his original plan, Donald Trump delivered a speech on the issue Wednesday night in Phoenix.\\n\\nTrump painted a grim picture of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He brought up families of victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. But who is he appealing to with this message? It's more of a primary crowd than a general-election one.\\n\\nGallup, which has tracked public opinion on this issue, found that 65 percent of Americans favor a path for immigrants who are living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they meet certain requirements over time. That's essentially reflected in the vote margin of the 2013 Senate bill — 68 U.S. senators voted in favor of comprehensive immigration reform that included only a path to citizenship after immigrants pay fines and wait more than a decade without committing a crime.\\n\\nWho does agree with Trump? At least half of Republicans — 31 percent of them want all immigrants in the U.S. illegally deported. An even higher percentage of Americans (72 percent) favor some path to legal status after a period of time, according to the Pew Research Center, including 56 percent of Republicans. During the 2013 immigration debate, House Republicans pushed legalization but not citizenship. After two weeks of flirting with possibly coming around to that House GOP position, Trump is now firmly to their right in a country that is growing decreasingly white and increasingly Latino.\\n\\nNPR's politics team annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.\\n\\nWhat a crowd, what a beautiful crowd. Thank you, thank you. Wow. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people. Thank you very much. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona. A state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love the people of Arizona, and together we are going to win the White House in November. Now, you know, this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So I said let's go have some fun tonight; we're going to Arizona.\\n\\nThis will be a little bit different; this won't be a rally speech per se.\\n\\nInstead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\\n\\nI've just landed, having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico. A man I like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\\n\\nAnd by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\\n\\nWe agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business.\\n\\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico and the leadership and friendship that we have between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation, and it will go on for a while, and in the end we're all going to win. Both countries. We're all going to win.\\n\\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations, and in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries. But it's going to be a fair relationship; we want fairness.\\n\\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly, there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\\n\\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do, thank you, thank you.\\n\\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. Doesn't serve you.\\n\\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages.\\n\\n[The bipartisan immigration reform bill (the Gang of Eight bill) the Senate passed in 2013 would not have meant open borders — it would have increased border security, for example, and included an employer verification system, as Politico reported at the time. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\\n\\nBut if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people — our forgotten working people — have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\\n\\n[Trump lamented the record pace of immigration, but between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. has actually seen more Mexican immigrants LEAVING the U.S. than coming in, a net loss of 140,000 immigrants. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out.\\n\\nIt's our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\\n\\nThen there's the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people. So many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on the stage in a little while, and I look forward to introducing — these are amazing, amazing people.\\n\\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process. It's called Hillary Clinton. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S. — think of it — into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies. He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class, one day before her death. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Ariz. A lot of you have known about Grant. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And they knew it was going to happen again.\\n\\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good. Then there's the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death. Ninety-years-old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\\n\\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\\n\\n[Trump cited multiple cases of people who had crimes committed against them, sometimes violent crimes. He noted the case of Marilyn Pharis of California. CBS News reported she was killed in a violent assault. One suspect was in the U.S. illegally and had been arrested two weeks earlier for meth possession. The Santa Maria, Calif., police chief lambasted the system. You know what we had to do? We had to cite him out, that's the problem with this system, this is not just in Santa Maria, this is all over the state of California and all over the United States. ... I am not remiss to say that from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento there's a blood trail leading to the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. 25,000. On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year, and this is what we get.\\n\\nFor the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\\n\\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back. And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\\n\\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead the media, and my opponent, discuss one thing and only one thing: The needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets. Not going to happen anymore, folks, Nov. 8. Not going to happen anymore.\\n\\nThe truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be — and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million, they have no idea what the number is.\\n\\n[The count of immigrants in the country illegally is an estimate, but several estimates put it in the same ballpark — and it's the 11 million ballpark, nowhere near 30 million. The Pew Research Center puts it at 11.3 million (a number that has held relatively steady for years, by its estimate, and is down by nearly 1 million from a recent peak in 2007). As of January 2012, the Department of Homeland Security put the count at 11.4 million. Trump has in fact made the 30 million claim before, and PolitiFact shot him down, labeling it pants on fire, finding other independent estimates that were in the 11 to 12 million range. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nFrankly, our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks. But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint.\\n\\nAnyone who tells you the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\\n\\nOnly the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American — you know this, you know this, this is what they talk about — facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And they also think the biggest thing — and you know this — is not nuclear, it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\\n\\nTo all politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity, so important. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\\n\\n[Trump has made crime committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally a major theme of his campaign. While he has spotlighted several real cases of murders committed by people in the country illegally, the context here is important. Multiple analyses have found that immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than those born in the United States. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nThank you, thank you.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona, you know it. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional, executive amnesty.\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, our citizens.\\n\\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where these people are. I always say Trojan horse — watch what's going to happen, folks, it's not going to be pretty. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders, if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\\n\\nHard to believe, hard to believe.\\n\\nNow that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.\\n\\n[Agree with Clinton's immigration policies or not, it's impossible to argue she has not answered a single question about them. She recently answered questions about immigration at a conference of black and Hispanic journalists, for example, and she has addressed questions about it in other interviews as well. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnd you notice all the time for weeks and weeks, they're debating my plan, debating it, talking about it, what about this, what about that? They never even mention her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire, it's a tough one. She doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country, by the way.\\n\\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, very great people, among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations. Very important to us.\\n\\nI also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And, most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\\n\\nNumber one. Are you ready? Are you ready? We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. 100 percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall. And they're great people, and great leaders, but they're going to pay for the wall.\\n\\n[The cost estimates for a wall along the border vary widely. Trump has put the cost at $8 billion to $12 billion, but other estimates have run as high as $25 billion, according to PolitiFact. — Sarah McCammon [After his meeting with Donald Trump today, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto reiterated his insistence that Mexico would not pay for construction of a border wall. Peña Nieto said he made that clear to Trump during their meeting, although Trump told reporters that the issue of payment was not discussed. — Scott Horsley]\\n\\nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall. We will use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors, that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below. Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out criminal cartels, and Mexico, you know that, will work with us. Mexico will work with us, I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today, I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\\n\\n[Trump told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City that they had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it. Peña Nieto says he made it clear Mexico will not pay, and Mexico's foreign minister says this position is nonnegotiable. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release.\\n\\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came. And they'll be brought great distances; we're not dropping them right across. They learned that, President Eisenhower, they dropped them across, right across, and they'd come back. Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances, but we will take them to the country where they came from. OK?\\n\\n[Trump cited President Eisenhower, referencing his Operation Wetback, the program undertaken by Eisenhower to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally. FactCheck.org notes that he deported some 2.1 million, a figure that is criticized as inflated by guesswork. More have been deported during President Obama's time in office. No one has deported as many as 11 million who are currently within the U.S. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nNumber three, number three. This is the one I think this it's so great, it's hard to believe people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero. Zero. They don't come in here, they don't come in here.\\n\\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country. Two million people, criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out, day one, as soon as I take office, day one, in joint operation with local, state and federal law enforcement.\\n\\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect. Say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve, I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are.\\n\\nDay one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. And you can call it deported if you want — the press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone.\\n\\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled. But their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\\n\\nThey're going out, they're going out fast.\\n\\nMoving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that. We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do. Crime all over the place. That's over, that's over folks. That's over.\\n\\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities — these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who are not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\\n\\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program, good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.\\n\\nThere's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders. None, none, none.\\n\\nOn my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law — named for Kate Steinle — to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal re-entry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong, and then we get 'em out.\\n\\nAnother reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they're going to go fast, believe me, they're going to go fast.\\n\\nWe are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice. Just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK? Maybe they'll be able to deport her.\\n\\nThe local police know who every one of these criminals and they know each and every one, by name, by crime, they will work so fast, and our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it; they've put up with it for years.\\n\\nAnd now, finally, we will turn the tables, and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\\n\\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks, which is good. We will expand the number of Border Patrol stations significantly.\\n\\n[Trump makes no mention of the potential cost of hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. According to Politico and USA Today, there are currently about 21,000 Border Patrol agents. Trump proposes an increase of about 25 percent. [Nowhere in Trump's speech does he acknowledge that apprehensions of Mexicans attempting to cross the Southern border are decreasing, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Report for 2015. — Richard Gonzales]\\n\\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible. And getting their endorsement means so much to me, more to me really than I can really say. It means so much — first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Trump noted that the Border Patrol endorsed him. It's true that the National Border Patrol Council, the union of U.S. Border Patrol agents, endorsed him during the primary, calling Trump the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country. But it hasn't been without controversy. The Los Angeles Times noted that the rank-and-file seem as polarized about Trump as the rest of the nation, with some going so far as to challenge their union leaders' decision. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nNumber four: Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding, no more funding.\\n\\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\\n\\nNumber five: Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\\n\\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. 5 million. And how about all of the millions who are waiting on line going through the process legally? So unfair.\\n\\n[In 2012, President Obama granted a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Upwards of 600,000 young people took advantage of that offer, which also made them eligible for work permits. In 2014, Obama tried to expand his deportation reprieve to millions of additional immigrants, most of whom had children who are U.S. citizens or were Green Card holders. Texas and other states challenged that action, and a federal judge in Texas put the president's executive order on hold. That stay remains in place, after a shorthanded Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 earlier this year. — Scott Horsley]\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs — including the 2014 amnesty, which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country. A disaster. In so many other ways. And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States, don't forget that. When you go to vote Nov. 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment and don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets, they've been forgotten.\\n\\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\\n\\nIn a Trump administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. Will be enforced.\\n\\nAs with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities.\\n\\nBut, unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement — and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\\n\\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges — that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current administration.\\n\\n[By prioritizing removal of immigrants who commit crimes, threaten security and who have arrived recently, Trump is essentially mirroring the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration. — Scott Horsley]\\n\\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\\n\\n[Trump's position on which potential immigrants to keep out of the country because of terrorism fears has shifted multiple times throughout his campaign. Late last year, following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., Trump began with a call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. In June, after a gunman who had pledged loyalty to ISIS shot and killed 50 people, including himself, at an Orlando nightclub, Trump called for banning refugees from countries with a terrorist presence, even though the shooter was born in the United States. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump repeated a similar position and also talked about countries where thorough vetting is difficult. He's also recently called for what he describes as extreme vetting based on ideology. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nAccording to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now, the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this, that we've ever had in the history of our country. Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out, and we have to straighten out fast.\\n\\nThe number is likely higher, but the administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.\\n\\nAs soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. I call it extreme vetting, right? I want extreme, it's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in, that's fine, but they're going to be good. It's extreme. And if people don't like it, we gotta have a country, folks. Gotta have a country.\\n\\n[It's true that Obama administration officials have expressed concerns about how to screen refugees from war-torn regions with little documentation. But the White House also says refugees undergo the most rigorous vetting process of any category of immigrants entering the United States. — Sarah McCammon]\\n\\nCountries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.\\n\\nWe have no idea who they are, where they come from, there's no documentation, there's no paperwork. It's going to end badly, folks, it's going to end very, very badly.\\n\\n[Trump claimed there's no paperwork. But that's not true. Lots is known about them, and they already undergo rigorous screening. NPR's Brian Naylor has reported that refugees are currently screened by several different agencies, and fingerprints are taken, biographical information is collected. They are then each individually interviewed by U.S. officials trained to verify that they are bona fide refugees. Refugees from Syria are then subject to additional screening that looks at where they came from and what caused them to flee their home. And all that takes an average of a year and a half to two years. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nFor the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones, and we'll get the money from the gulf states. We don't want to put up the money; we owe almost $20 trillion. Double since Obama took office. Our national debt. But we will get the money from gulf states and others. We'll supervise it, we'll build safe zones, which is something I think all of us want to see.\\n\\nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include — and this is so important, especially if you get the right people, and we will get the right people — an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\\n\\nThank you, we're very proud of our country aren't we? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country.\\n\\nFor instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan — in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified, that's what they say. That's what they say, they're justified. And we're admitting them through our country.\\n\\nApplicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very few people will slip through the cracks. Hopefully none.\\n\\nNumber seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.\\n\\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won't take 'em back. So we say, OK, we'll keep 'em.\\n\\n[According to a recent New York Times article, 23 countries are considered largely uncooperative in taking back their citizens. The U.S. has released 8,000 immigrants with criminal convictions (both with legal status and those who are in the country illegally) since 2013. The issue, the Times explained, is that some countries won't take these people back, but the Supreme Court has also ruled that the U.S. can't detain these people indefinitely. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nNot going to happen with me, folks, not going to happen. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And they would comply if we would act properly. In other words, if we had leaders who knew what they were doing, which we don't.\\n\\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead, we have 'em all over the place. Probably a couple in this room, as a matter of fact. But I hope not.\\n\\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back. Hard to believe with the power that we have. We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up, that keep getting beat up. These 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch — she had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it. And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n[Trump appears to be referring to this Boston Globe article in which ICE told the Globe that 12,941 were released from 2008 to 2014. The numbers were actually higher, over 86,000, the Globe notes, between 2013 and 2015 alone. The 12,941 figure was a number that the Supreme Court forced ICE to release, according to the Globe. Not all were violent criminals, and some 140 countries would not cooperate with deportations. It's not clear, however, what specifically Donald Trump is suggesting Hillary Clinton could have done about that. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation. We take 'em, we take 'em.\\n\\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately.\\n\\nFor years, Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens, never happens. Hillary Clinton, all talk — unfortunately, when there is action, it's always the wrong decision, do you ever notice?\\n\\nIn my administration, we will ensure that this system is in place — and I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays — and they really are a big problem — pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas. And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful? What that would have meant.\\n\\nLast year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\\n\\n[A substantial number of people in the U.S. illegally entered the country legally, but have overstayed visas. Last year, when Marco Rubio said 40 percent of people in the nation illegally have overstayed visas, PolitiFact rated it mostly true. Fresh estimates of the figure aren't available, the site wrote, but the 40 percent figure seemed to be a fairly good estimate. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave — the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is — then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\\n\\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\\n\\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\\n\\n[E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work in this country. It's used by less than 10 percent of employers today, but expanding the system was an important component of the bipartisan immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013. (It died in the House.) E-Verify faces lingering challenges, including false negatives when people who should be allowed to work are shown to be ineligible, and privacy concerns. — Scott Horsley]\\n\\nImmigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life — the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and everything else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.\\n\\nWe will enforce all of our immigration laws.\\n\\nThe same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. Treasury.\\n\\nThose who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\\n\\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers. The forgotten people, workers. We're going to take care of our workers. And by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to negotiate trade deals, we're going to be bring our jobs back home, we're going to bring our jobs back home. We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters. And if countries want to leave Arizona, and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them, it's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence, remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it to the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen; there will be consequences.\\n\\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.\\n\\nMany of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country, so true. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration — as we have following, if you think, previous immigration waves, we've had some big waves, and tremendously positive things have happened, incredible things have happened — to ensure assimilation, we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word, integration and upward mobility.\\n\\nWithin just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.\\n\\nThe time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:\\n\\nTo keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms\\n\\nTo select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We take anybody, come on in, just anybody. Not anymore. You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It's a two-way street.\\n\\nWe need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others — remember, under a Trump administration it's called America First.\\n\\nTo choose immigrants based on merit, merit, skill and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice?\\n\\nAnd to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that, in particular, African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly. And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker, she's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on Nov. 8, and then she'll say so long, see you in four years. That's what it is. She's going to do nothing. Just look at the past — she's done nothing, she's been there for 35 years, she's done nothing. And I say, what do you have to lose? Choose me, watch how good we're going to do together, watch. You watch.\\n\\nWe want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.\\n\\nWe've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. They're archaic, they're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\\n\\nSo let's now talk about the big picture.\\n\\nThese 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's what's going to happen, folks.\\n\\nBecause I am proudly not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you, I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump. I will get this done for you and your family. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right.\\n\\nWe will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and the gangs are all over the place, and welfare use will decrease.\\n\\n[Trump said welfare use will decrease when he's president. But it is a myth that immigrants in the U.S. illegally qualify for those subsidies. As CNN noted in 2014: Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and most other public benefits. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status and under the 1996 welfare law, even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the United States for more than five years. Still, some households of immigrants in the U.S. illegally do receive some form of subsidies because of children born in the U.S. who qualify. A right-leaning immigration think tank did an analysis showing immigrant households receive more on average than nonimmigrant households that also receive benefits. But that study has been criticized as fatally flawed. — Domenico Montanaro]\\n\\nWe will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them for once and for all.\\n\\nFor those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system, and it will be an efficient system, will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\\n\\n[Here Trump endorses the notion that people will be forced, or will choose to return home, and then get in line to come here legally. According to the State Department, there are currently 1.3 million Mexicans who are waiting in line for a visa. Only a small fraction have any realistic hope of seeing a visa anytime soon. Trump is talking about establishing new visa caps or limits under rules that haven't been determined. — Richard Gonzales]\\n\\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.\\n\\nOur message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.\\n\\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\\n\\nImportantly, in several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system — then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\\n\\n[This was the big question mark coming into tonight's speech. Trump has sent mixed signals in recent days over how he would handle the millions of immigrants who are living in the country illegally but whose only crime was crossing the border without authorization. Trump made it clear tonight that there will be no path to legalization for these immigrants, short of returning to their home country and reapplying. But he left open the question of whether broader deportations would be necessary. — Scott Horsley]\\n\\nRight now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis like never before.\\n\\n[It's hard to characterize the current job market as being in crisis, especially considering where it has been. Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, down from a post-recession high of 10 percent. There are still some signs of problems left over from the recession — the length of unemployment still hasn't quite recovered to prerecession levels, for example. However, the economy is looking solid enough that chatter is building about the Fed raising interest rates soon — Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer recently said that the U.S. is very close to full employment. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAll energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. Immigration security, cut it off.\\n\\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing — and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\\n\\nThese are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And you notice? She doesn't answer. She didn't go to Louisiana, she didn't go to Mexico, she was invited, she doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again, believe me.\\n\\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent horrible crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\\n\\nThis election is our last chance — and I believe this — to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. Nov. 8, Nov. 8. You gotta get out and vote Nov. 8. It's our last chance, it's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment, remember that.\\n\\nSo I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for — and who we are fighting for.\\n\\nSo I am going to ask — these are really special people that I've gotten to know — all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\\n\\n[The family of Kate Steinle did not appear onstage with Trump. It has a federal lawsuit pending against the former sheriff of San Francisco and two federal agencies, blaming them for Kate Steinle's death. — Richard Gonzales]\\n\\nI've become friends with so many:\\n\\n{PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS — EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER AND EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TRUMP INTO THE MICROPHONE}\\n\\nThat is tough stuff, I will tell you. Incredible people. Now is the time for these voices to be heard.\\n\\nNow is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.\\n\\nNow is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.\\n\\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible problem. It can be fixed quickly.\\n\\nLet's secure our border.\\n\\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime.\\n\\nLet's protect our Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nAnd let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country. This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. Nov. 8, we have to get everybody — this is such an important state, we have to get everybody to go out and vote. We're going to bring, thank you, thank you.\\n\\nWe're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back. Thank you, thank you. This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it. And by the way, if you haven't been looking at what's been happening with the polls in the last 3-4 days, you should start looking.\\n\\nTogether, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.\\n\\nTogether, we can save America itself.\\n\\nJoin me in this mission, we're going to Make America Great Again.\\n\\nThank you, I love you, thank you, God bless you, everybody!"}

{"original": "Secretary Of State Pompeo Continues His Extensive Mideast Travels\\n\\nWhile in Cairo on Thursday, Mike Pompeo gave a speech blaming many of the region's problems — in particular the rise of ISIS — on a lack of leadership from former President Obama.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nWe have been following Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tour of U.S. allies in the Middle East this week. He is telling these allies that President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria does not mean that the United States is giving up on this region. Yesterday in a speech in Cairo, Pompeo blamed many of the region's problems, in particular the rise of ISIS, on a lack of leadership from former President Barack Obama.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMIKE POMPEO: What did we learn from all of this? We learned that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. And when we partner with our enemies, they advance.\\n\\nGREENE: OK. As we wrap up this week to talk about this, we have two journalists who have spent a long number of years following developments in this region, NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam, and NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre. Thank you both for being here.\\n\\nGREG MYRE, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\\n\\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\\n\\nGREENE: Jackie, a pretty tough speech from Pompeo. I mean, it was cast as articulating, you know, the vision for the Trump administration, but a lot of it seemed to focus on the previous administration.\\n\\nNORTHAM: It sure did. You know, he took - Pompeo took direct aim at President Obama and his policy on the Middle East. You know, Pompeo never actually mentions Obama by name, but there was no question about who he was talking about. He said it was an American who also gave a speech in Cairo. And, of course, Obama gave this landmark speech in 2009 which was viewed as an outreach to the Muslim world.\\n\\nGREENE: Yeah.\\n\\nNORTHAM: David, Pompeo criticized Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. He accused Obama of blaming the U.S. for the problems of the Middle East, instead of when, Pompeo said, Obama should have been providing strong American leadership. Pompeo said - and I'm quoting here, David - the U.S. is a force for good in the Middle East. But, you know, one of the main reasons for this trip was really to clear up confusion, you know, caused by conflicting statements from the Trump administration about the U.S. withdrawing troops from Syria.\\n\\nGREENE: Yeah. And I definitely want to get into that confusion. But let me just ask you - the criticisms of Obama, how fair are they?\\n\\nNORTHAM: Well, certainly, Obama, you know, had policy failures. And many people think the biggest was underestimating the ferocity, the strength of ISIS in Iraq and Syria and then having to send troops into both of those countries and that Obama did not respond after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used sarin gas on his own people. There's also criticism that Obama had a hands-off approach to, you know, foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Much of Obama's policy was a reaction to the Iraq War, which, you know, began under George W. Bush administration and which, by the way, Pompeo never mentioned in his speech.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, Greg, let me turn to you. I mean, what about what Pompeo said about the vision for the Trump administration, and how are they dealing with what does sound like a contradiction - saying that if you retreat, there is chaos, but a lot of people see removing troops from Syria as retreating?\\n\\nMYRE: Yeah. And more even, hearing this morning, David, that the U.S. is beginning the first initial stages of a withdrawal. We don't have a timeline, and this is a process that's supposed to take a while - you know, quite likely, weeks or even months. But we are getting these initial reports about that. And Pompeo seems clear about what, you know, the Trump administration wants, but not really on how to achieve it. Let's listen to a bit of his speech from yesterday.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPOMPEO: In Syria, the United States will use diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot and work through the U.N.-led process to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people.\\n\\nMYRE: So that phrase, expel every last Iranian boot, a very ambitious idea. This Iranian-Syrian partnership goes back decades. So on the one hand, you have Pompeo announcing this ambitious goal, but at the same time, the U.S. is preparing to pull back. And it just seems a real contradiction there.\\n\\nGREENE: One that the Trump administration's going to have to keep dealing with. I mean, even though we're talking about a small number of troops in Syria, to actually be removing all of them, as you say, that you're going to have an influence over the future of this country, I mean, that's going to cause a lot of questions to be asked.\\n\\nMYRE: Absolutely. And, you know, what we're seeing here is sort of this, you know, recurring theme where - you know, of Trump's aides going to clean up confusion that he's made. We saw this when he questioned the relevance of NATO. Officials would rush to Europe and do that. In Korea and Japan, when he mused about the cost of troops there. And now we're seeing this in the Middle East. And what we - you know, this began back with Trump's tweet about a month ago, when he said the U.S. was going to leave Syria. And then there's been a scramble ever since. Not only among U.S. allies, but also rivals in the region. What does this mean? Turkey, Iran, Russia, Syria - everybody trying to figure out what it means. And so there is this great confusion about the Syria policy right now.\\n\\nGREENE: Well, Jackie, as Pompeo takes on that confusion, where does he go from here?\\n\\nNORTHAM: Well, he's actually arrived in the Gulf region today. One of his stops, David, this weekend, will be Saudi Arabia. And he's due to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while he's there. And, of course, the issue of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is definitely expected to come up. You know, U.S. officials briefed reporters before he left in saying that the Saudi government needs to have, quote, credible narrative over Khashoggi's killing. But the Trump administration has backed the crown prince. There's strong ties between the two countries, financial. And so there are doubts whether Pompeo will push the crown prince hard for answers about what happened to Khashoggi.\\n\\nGREENE: All right. That's NPR's Jackie Northam along with NPR's Greg Myre. Thank you both for talking this morning. We appreciate it.\\n\\nMYRE: Thanks, David.\\n\\nNORTHAM: Thanks a lot, David.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Migrants Are Stuck In Mexico\\n\\nA Honduran mother of two, who is pregnant with a third, remains in a Mexico City shelter after hearing of the U.S. family separation policy.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nAt a migrant shelter in Mexico City, it's time for English class. The children are sitting behind a wooden table. They're mischievously running up to the teacher or giggling with their classmates.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: Es eye. Eye.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Eye.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And when they get too rowdy, the teacher makes them focus with a song.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: (Singing in Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The children, who are anywhere from 6 to 10 years old, practice words like hair and ear and eye. There is one word they all know, though.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: Hi.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hi.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: They say hi and greet me with big smiles. And then one little girl with long, tangled, brown hair, jumps up and throws herself into my arms for a hug, and she doesn't want to let go. The little girl's mother is from Honduras. And the family, which includes another little boy, has been here at this shelter for about a month. We aren't using any names for the family's protection.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The young mother is in her mid-20s, petite with a dimple and big, bright eyes. She left her home behind because of threats from the father of her two children.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He would hit me, she says. He would threaten me and the children. I sent him to prison, but he's out now, and he's psychotic, she says.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And even though I moved from home to get away from him, he would always discover where I was.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He was involved in the gang, she says, with bad people that can do a lot of damage. When he found out that she was with another man and pregnant, he went crazy, she said. And that's when she decided she had to leave, taking the long road north, hoping to get to America in safety.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But she's heard about President Trump's new zero-tolerance policies. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also made it harder for victims of domestic violence to get asylum in the United States.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So she decided to wait here for now, unsure what to do next in the midst of the Trump administration's shifting policies.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's very difficult that they're doing this, she says. Our children are our lives. I don't know what to do. It's just unimaginable that they would take my children away. Everything I've done has been in order to protect them and stay with them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But I can't go back to Honduras, and I can't stay in Mexico either. She says her husband tracked her down to another Mexican migrant shelter and then called her mother. She says, He told my mother he would find me and send me and my children home in pieces.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So she's staying put for now. But other migrants are still traveling north.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN MOVING)\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Our next stop is in the town of Apizaco, about two and a half hours from Mexico City.\\n\\nI'm standing on the side of the train tracks. The migrants are perched on top of these trains. They're carrying backpacks. They're - it's chilly. They're wearing woolen hats as the train rumbles north.\\n\\nSome jump off while the train is moving and make their way to the Sagrada Familia migrant shelter right next to the tracks. It offers them a safe place to sleep, some hot food before they grab the next train to the border.\\n\\nInside, the migrants pass the time sitting in the concrete courtyard or kicking a ball around. Sergio Luna is the shelter director.\\n\\nSERGIO LUNA: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's a dangerous journey, he says. Some will be attacked, raped or lose limbs making their way north. In fact, while we're there, we see a couple try and jump onto the train and miss, almost getting pulled under the grinding wheels. And on top of these dangers, Luna says, now migrants have heard they might be separated from their kids in the U.S. or be put in detention.\\n\\nLUNA: (Through interpreter) They are telling us they don't want to lose their children. At the same time, they don't want to stay here in Mexico. They are trapped here because many of these families are fleeing for their lives from violence.\\n\\n(Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He says Mexico isn't safe for these migrants, as criminal groups also target them here. But Mexico is now forced to accommodate them because of U.S. immigration policy.\\n\\nLUNA: (Through interpreter) Mexican government, as well as UNICEF, the United Nations and other groups that deal with this are simply not prepared to help and protect these migrants. At the moment, it's temporary shelters like these that are the frontlines of helping these stranded migrants.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN HORN)\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Before I leave, Luna tells me he worries that the Trump administration will use immigration as a currency to be bartered. Trump often links the issue of immigration to negotiations on trade with Mexico. Adding to all this volatility is the direction Mexico itself is headed. On July 1, there will be a presidential election. And if the polls are to be believed, front-runner and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could win. The former American ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, says he will have to confront the issue of immigration head on.\\n\\nROBERTA JACOBSON: I think one of the things that's most interesting that he will discover is that Mexico has become, in some ways - and I don't want to overstate this - more and more like the United States in the migration issue in that it is not just a transit country anymore. It is, in fact, a receiving country. There are people from all over the world, but in particular from Central America, who are coming to Mexico and staying.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Since 2014, the number of people seeking asylum in Mexico has increased 683 percent to nearly 15,000 asylum-seekers. This year, there will be even more. Human rights groups say helping Central American migrants is not Mexico's priority. Instead, despite the claims of President Trump, the country has been upping its enforcement and cooperation with the U.S. by deporting Central Americans here illegally. Migration experts estimate that 400,000 Central American migrants enter Mexico every year, and Roberta Jacobson says Mexico has been a vital partner in U.S. immigration strategy.\\n\\nJACOBSON: Mexico has returned as many as half the number of people who in total attempted to get to the United States, so it does make a difference to the United States whether or not Mexico is cooperating.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That cooperation between the incoming government and the Trump administration is not a given anymore. All three main candidates have come out and condemned Trump's immigration policies. And while the election here is not about Donald Trump, he is deeply unpopular and questions are being asked.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: On an afternoon talk show, this was the exchange between the anchor and guest in reaction to Trump's zero-tolerance policies.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED GUEST: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The anchor says, according to Mr. Trump, Mexico does nothing. But a terrorist has never crossed into the U.S. via the southern border - never. The guest responds, at this moment, the question is this - Mexico has had a historic collaboration on migration, and what has that gotten us? We shouldn't get angry, but we should rethink our policies in regards to the United States.\\n\\nAnd Mexico's next potential president could do just that. We spoke with Lopez Obrador's top security adviser Alfonso Durazo, who suggested in our interview that immigration enforcement would no longer be a priority.\\n\\nALFONSO DURAZO: (Through interpreter) Military and police force will not be used to repress the migrant population. We'll primarily use diplomatic channels with the origin countries of these migrants to reach some kind of agreement.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: A former Trump administration official with knowledge of Mexico told me that some at the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. are worried about what Lopez Obrador could do. Trump's immigration policies could force Lopez Obrador into a corner, the official said. And the new government may take their foot off the gas on migration enforcement.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Que paso?\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Back at the shelter in Mexico City, the young mother holds her daughter close.\\n\\n(Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nThe little girl who hugged me says, while shyly smiling, that she wants to be a doctor when she grows up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Doctora.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Doctora, wow.\\n\\nFor now their fate is unclear.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The young mother says, We're human beings with feelings. My family in the U.S. keeps telling me to be patient and that God will open the door.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "North Korea's Kim Talks Of New Weapons, But Leaves Door Open For Biden\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jon Chol Jin/AP Jon Chol Jin/AP\\n\\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling for beefing up his country's nuclear and military capabilities, but appears to be leaving open the possibility for negotiation with the U.S., just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\\n\\nWe must do everything we can to increase nuclear war deterrence even further as we build the strongest military capability, Kim told delegates at the conclusion of an eight-day long congress of the ruling Workers Party in Pyongyang, state media reported on Wednesday.\\n\\nIn a report to the congress last week, Kim referred to the U.S. as North Korea's principal enemy, and vowed to develop a raft of new nuclear and conventional weapons to counter the threat from Washington.\\n\\nBut he also affirmed previous agreements with the Trump administration, which suggests that they could serve as the basis for future negotiations. In his report, Kim praised the 2018 Singapore summit with President Trump, which yielded the joint declaration that assured the establishment of new [North Korea]-U.S. relations.\\n\\nThat declaration called for denuclearization and a peace regime on the Korean peninsula, and a new, presumably less hostile, relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. Negotiations later broke down after an abortive second summit in Vietnam in 2019.\\n\\nKim's remarks are not exactly an olive branch, but it's not slamming the door, by any stretch of the imagination, either. So it's something in between, says John Delury, a historian at Yonsei University in Seoul.\\n\\nKim's list of military technologies he plans to develop is a warning to Washington, but also the starting point for diplomacy and negotiation, Delury contends.\\n\\nThe congress also came up with some plans to strengthen the country's economy, with a developmental blueprint for the next five years. Kim kicked off the congress by bluntly admitting that his plans for the past five years had fallen flat.\\n\\nBesides prescribing building up heavy industries, including steel and chemicals, Kim called for sourcing more materials for light industrial goods domestically that North Korea used to have to import, a policy economists call import substitution.\\n\\nMost consumer goods are now produced within the country, whereas in the past, they depended a lot on Chinese-made goods, says Choi Eun-ju, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank outside Seoul. Now, the domestically produced goods are available in the markets, and North Korean consumers actually prefer them, she adds.\\n\\nWhile North Korea can't produce enough of the goods, Choi adds, they have helped the country to scrape by, while the border with China — the North's main trading partner — has been shut during the pandemic.\\n\\nKim conceded that, in addition to external factors, such as the pandemic, international sanctions and natural disasters, the party had committed serious mistakes that contributed to the country's dire economic situation.\\n\\nThis represents a break with the past, when the party attributed setbacks to factors beyond its control, says the Sejong Institute's Choi Eun-ju.\\n\\nKim admits that there are external factors, but he also addresses the internal reasons, she says. Instead of accusing the North Korean people or laborers, he blames bureaucrats, including himself.\\n\\nNPR's Se Eun Gong in Seoul contributed to this report"}
{"original": "Transcript: Dan Coats Warns The Lights Are 'Blinking Red' On Russian Cyberattacks\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\\n\\nThe director of National Intelligence spoke before the Hudson Institute, a D.C.-based conservative think tank, on July 13. Transcript provided by the Hudson Institute.\\n\\nKen, thank you very much. It's nice to be here at Hudson. We enjoyed Hudson's presence in Indiana for a time. Then former OMB Director Mitch Daniels became governor of Indiana — in the meantime, lured Hudson to come to the middle of the country to get a different perspective perhaps than what we get from the coast. You were there for a number of years. I had the privilege of working with people there. We understand why you came back here, moving it to more foreign policy-focused stuff. And a lot of that is what happens here. But we do appreciate the fact that you still value Indiana. Some of your employees might be missing the ease of living and cost of living in Indiana relative to Washington — not to mention the commute to work. But nevertheless, it's very nice for me to be able to be here with you to lay some groundwork for what I think is one of — if not the — top challenge that we face in terms of threats to our country, to our people and our processes in the future.\\n\\nSo before I sit down with Walter to talk about a range of global threats that we face, I'd like to focus my initial remarks on the growing cyber threat to our nation's security. And specifically, I'd like to put the current cyber threat in terms of the threats that we've had in a historical context and to define who is most responsible and what are they attempting to do, and then discuss the intelligence community's response to that. So each morning when I get up, I'm given a roundtable of news on what happened while I was asleep, or what happened yesterday around the world. And almost without fail, the longest section of this news roundup is the section on cyber issues, which details multiple reports of cyberattacks and alerts. This issue affects all of us. And it is increasingly affecting numerous aspects of our daily life, as many of you are familiar with.\\n\\nYou only need to go back less than two decades ago to put, I think, the current cyber threat into its proper context. In 2001, our vulnerability was heightened because of the stovepipe approach of our intelligence and law enforcement communities that produced what they called silos of information. At the time, intelligence and law enforcement communities were identifying alarming activities that suggested that an attack was potentially coming to the United States. It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then CIA Director George Tenet, the system was blinking red. And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say the warning lights are blinking red again. Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.\\n\\nEvery day, foreign actors — the worst offenders being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against targets in the United States. The targets range from U.S. businesses to the federal government (including our military), to state and local governments, to academic and financial institutions and elements of our critical infrastructure — just to name a few. The attacks come in different forms. Some are tailored to achieve very tactical goals while others are implemented for strategic purpose, including the possibility of a crippling cyberattack against our critical infrastructure.\\n\\nAll of these disparate efforts share a common purpose: to exploit America's openness in order to undermine our long-term competitive advantage.\\n\\nIn regards to the state actions, Russia has been the most aggressive foreign actor — no question. And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy. In regards to the upcoming midterm elections, I think there may have been some confusion between what we are seeing now compared to what we saw in 2016. As the Department of Homeland Security noted, we are not yet seeing the kind of electoral interference in specific states and voter databases that we experienced in 2016. However, we fully realize that we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself. Therefore, and moreover, we are seeing aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and to spread propaganda focused on hot-button issues that are intended to exacerbate socio-political divisions. Despite public statements by the Kremlin to the contrary, we continue to see individuals affiliated with the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency creating new social media accounts, masquerading as Americans, and then using these accounts to draw attention to divisive issues. We have learned, just before this meeting, about the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officials relative to their role in 2016.\\n\\nBut focusing on the potential impact of these actions on our midterm elections misses the more important point: these actions are persistent, they are pervasive, and they are meant to undermine America's democracy on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is election time or not. Russian actors and others are exploring vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure as well. The DHS and FBI — in coordination with international partners — have detected Russian government actors targeting government and businesses in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors.\\n\\nThe warning signs are there, the system is blinking, and that is why I believe we are at a critical point. Today, unlike the status of our intelligence community in 2001, we're much more integrated and much better at sharing information between agencies. But the evolving cyber threat is illuminating new daily challenges in how we treat information. We are dealing with information silos of a different kind, including between the public and private sector.\\n\\nBut here's the good news. As I just mentioned — but it needs to be stated again — the intelligence community today is more integrated than it's ever been. We are sharing information across agencies at all levels. In regard to the midterms, we are partnering with DHS and FBI to provide support, information and grants to state election officials from all 50 states. We will continue to look for opportunities to support this effort. And regarding the larger cyber threat issue, the president has signed an executive order strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure, in which the president tasked a whole-of-government risk management review resulting in a number of actions that OMB is now taking to strengthen U.S. networks with IT modernizing guidelines. The president has also authorized the use of all available tools of state power — including attribution, criminal indictments and economic levers — to punish malicious cyber actors. Our leaders at the National Security Council consider this as a top priority. And we are continuously pursuing actions on this issue. As you know, we're in a transition period with the NSC, but I have had numerous talks with our new national security adviser and members of the NSC about the importance of raising this to a top issue, and they're doing so. Within the government, we're working continuously to detect, warn and — when necessary — respond to cyber threats. We have a multi-agency Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center that builds understanding of cyber threats to inform decision-makers. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are demonstrating leadership on the foreign influence threat and applying a more assertive federal response, as we have just seen today. And my former colleagues in the House and the Senate are bringing significant attention to the threat from cyber and have expressed strong support for legislative action.\\n\\nHaving said that, we have to do better in what we deliver to our customers: how we get it to them and the speed by which they receive it. Today, those crosscutting cyber threats have been illuminated — but how rigidly we still act when it comes to public discourse. Respective self-interests of the government, the private sector and the public have created independence rather than complimentary lines of effort and awareness. As a result, we need to think differently about our customers.\\n\\nIn many ways, the nature of the cyber threat requires that we — the national security community — treat the private sector and American people as intelligence customers. And that is why you will see us talking about this threat more vocally, and why you will continue to see us publish unclassified assessments and statements to inform the American people.\\n\\nEveryone, if we are to succeed in dealing with this threat, we must take ownership of the challenge. It will take the government, the private sector and the American people all doing their part to better position our country for the future. As a government, we are having a more open dialogue about this threat. In particular, we in the IC need to provide the information available to us to the private sector and to the public to better inform their decision-making. And we need the private sector to see the public good in developing greater protections in the software, information systems and applications on the market. We also need the American people to verify the credibility of the sources of information upon which they base their decisions. Whether those sources are social media reports, cable news or newspapers, it is essential that we all apply critical thinking to all sources of information. This evolution in the IC's approach is part of the transformation which we're driving within the ODNI and throughout the IC in coming years. We have brought together experts and leaders from across the intelligence community to take stock of where we are and what we must do to reach the next level of effectiveness.\\n\\nThe result of this effort, which brought together the heads and deputies of all the intelligence community agencies — all 17 of them — is a new vision for the future of the intelligence community. We call it Intelligence Community 2025. Where do we need to be? What kind of capabilities do we need to have? What kind of insights do we need to have in terms of the threats that we face? And we are putting together significant efforts to stay ahead of the game and ahead of the curve, to be able to deliver to our customers, starting with the president, working through his policymakers, working through the agencies, and working through the American public with both the private and the government sector. So with that, at this particular time I would like to thank you for the invitation. I know that we'll have a good discussion with Walter Russell Mead about this. We can look at the larger threats or whatever questions that need to be addressed. And I would much rather do that than continue to talk up here, even though, as a former senator, we love to talk."}

DON'T TELL ME - the NPR news quiz. Hey, now, don't storm the Capitol. Storm me, the Capi-Bill (ph). I'm Bill Kurtis, and here is your host, who is coming to you from the bottom of a Twitter hole - Peter Sagal.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE SOUND EFFECT)\\n\\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\\n\\nThank you, Bill. Thanks, everybody. We are all very excited to be back with you because we are so looking forward to what's going to be a great new year, which, of course, starts next week. We really are looking forward to starting 2021 and putting behind us the terrible events of Dec. 37, 2020. Later on, we're going to be talking to actor Jane Krakowski, but while you're waiting to ring in the new year, give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. It's time to welcome our first listener contestant.\\n\\nHi. You're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.\\n\\nGABRIEL CASTILLO: Hey, how are you doing?\\n\\nSAGAL: I'm doing all right. Who's this?\\n\\nCASTILLO: This is Gabriel Castillo from Tulsa, Okla.\\n\\nSAGAL: Hey, how are things in Tulsa?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Well, they're cold right now, but, usually, they're windy.\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, that sounds kind of exotic. So what do you do there in Tulsa?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Well, I work in the news. I'm a web producer at a local news station. So I wake up deep in the night, and I type up news stories all evening, and then I get the days off. It's pretty exciting.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah. And that must be pretty dull these days. What's there to talk about?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Right. You know, I've been boring myself to death over here.\\n\\nSAGAL: Welcome to the show, Gabriel. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian whose movie Extra Ordinary is streaming now where movies stream. It's Maeve Higgins.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE SOUND EFFECT)\\n\\nMAEVE HIGGINS: Hi, Gabriel.\\n\\nCASTILLO: Hey there.\\n\\nSAGAL: Next, she's the writer behind the advice column Ask Amy. Her most recent book is Strangers Tend To Tell Me Things. It's Amy Dickinson.\\n\\nAMY DICKINSON: Hi.\\n\\nCASTILLO: How you doing?\\n\\nSAGAL: And a comedian you can see in the new documentary History Of Swear Words on Netflix. It's Joel Kim Booster.\\n\\nJOEL KIM BOOSTER: Hi, Gabriel.\\n\\nCASTILLO: What's going on?\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, Gabriel, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time? Bill Kurtis is going to read you three quotations from the week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain just two of them, you'll win our prize - any voice from our show that you might choose in your voice mail You ready to play?\\n\\nCASTILLO: I am.\\n\\nSAGAL: OK, let's do it then. Your first quote is from the president of the United States in a video he posted on Wednesday afternoon.\\n\\nKURTIS: We love you. You're all very special.\\n\\nSAGAL: The president was saying something he has never once said to his own children to people who at that moment were doing what?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Bursting into the Capitol, in the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nSAGAL: They were sacking the Capitol.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE EFFECT)\\n\\nSAGAL: A mob reached the Capitol building in what NPR is calling an insurrection by pro-Trump extremists and Fox News is calling a self-guided tour of the Senate chambers. Now, it all looked pretty scary, but don't worry. The National Guard was on standby, ready to act if any one of those people kneeled during the national anthem.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: I was mightily concerned about the fashions on display from the people trying to do the coup. It looked like Farm & Fleet goes to Burning Man. It was really...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHIGGINS: You know, I was looking at it, and I love how the Capitol is so open, right? Like, it's the people's house, and that's why it was easy to get in. But I have to say there's a castle on the island that I'm from in Cobh (ph), and it has, like, little slits at the top of it to pour hot oil out of. It has...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh, yeah.\\n\\nHIGGINS: It has what's called a murder hole (laughter).\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\nHIGGINS: And it works. You know, it's worked for 2,000 years now to keep out the marauders and their terrible fashions.\\n\\nSAGAL: Did you ever have to, as you were growing up on this island, serve in the castle to defend from marauders, or does that only happen once you move to America?\\n\\nHIGGINS: (Laughter) Yeah, it's funny, isn't it? A lot of people are like, this is not American. I'm like, but I've only ever seen this in America. But I...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHIGGINS: And I should also say that, like, the castle in Cobh now - they just project a big Santa Claus onto it at Christmastime. It's not - the murder hole is no longer in use.\\n\\nSAGAL: Well, not yet. Now, we should say that the people who tried to overthrow our democracy did not, at least for the moment, win. They did not stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory. The Senate reconvened later in the trashed Capitol, and Mitch McConnell gave a heartfelt speech about democracy, after which he had to give the heart back to the cadaver he stole it from.\\n\\nDICKINSON: (Laughter) Oh.\\n\\nSAGAL: But what was amazing was, after all that, all of that, Senator Ted Cruz still objected to certifying the election, which led to the second unimaginable event of the day, people hating Ted Cruz even more.\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: You know, it's so hard to look at Ted Cruz sometimes because he looks like his own Madame Tussauds statue is melting, you know? Like, it looks like he just - he's wearing a mask of his own skin. It's so creepy.\\n\\nSAGAL: Oh, God.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Now, after all of this, the president was finally banned from Twitter and Facebook for promoting sedition. So he was reduced to setting national policy by doing 30-second dance videos on TikTok.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHIGGINS: I was so concerned about what platform he was going to move to because he got blocked from all of them except for Pinterest. And I was like, oh, no. Pinterest is so cute, and now he's just going to be, like, quilting Confederate flags together.\\n\\nDICKINSON: You don't want to see his dream board, I assure you. Yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: All right. Gabriel, here is your next quote.\\n\\nKURTIS: I love puppies.\\n\\nSAGAL: Those three words in social media posts may have sealed the victory for Reverend Raphael Warnock as he and Jon Ossoff were victorious in elections held where on Tuesday?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Georgia.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: ...Georgia.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE SOUND EFFECT)\\n\\nSAGAL: This was good news for Democrats that got overshadowed by the bad news for the country. Trump Republicans to the very bitter end, Georgia Senators Loeffler and Perdue both showed their loyalty to the president by also losing races in Georgia. This was somewhat of a surprise that had never happened. Democrats had never won runoff elections in Georgia. It took until the next day to call the race for Jon Ossoff, but Democrats were optimistic because at that point, all the remaining votes to be counted came from the Indigo Girls.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: Finally, he was named the new senator on Wednesday, just in time to see his new offices ransacked by Visigoths.\\n\\nHIGGINS: Oh, no (laughter). Yeah, I feel so bad for all the new people. I mean, they did a great job, but it must be rough on your first week for that to happen.\\n\\nSAGAL: It's true. But on the other hand, all the people who were there and don't keep particularly clean offices have an excuse. Like when Ossoff is taking a tour going, oh yeah, the damage. Oh, yes. This was like that before. Yeah, this is what happened. They came in and ransacked my office. That's what happened. Ossoff will enter the Senate at the age of 33, the youngest in decades. And interestingly, it makes them exactly the same age that Joe Biden was 100 years ago.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDICKINSON: You know, one thing I loved was after these victories were announced, there are a lot of - on social media, a lot of sharing of peach emojis...\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes.\\n\\nDICKINSON: ...You know? That was kind of fun. It's the first time in a long time I've seen a peach emoji actually stand for, you know, a peach.\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: Yeah, it was - I just thought everyone was super horny all night on Twitter.\\n\\nDICKINSON: Yeah, I know.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: This is - of course, Maeve, in case you don't know, Georgia is famously the Peach Tree State.\\n\\nHIGGINS: Oh, I was just, like, laughing along nervously like...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSAGAL: All right, Gabriel, here is your last quote. And we are happily leaving politics behind, and we are returning to our normal, nightmarish lives.\\n\\nKURTIS: All right, Bill. Don't miss it. Read the quote, read the quote. You got this, Bill.\\n\\nSAGAL: So Bill was demonstrating something psychologists say that we are all doing more and more and more of every day during lockdown. What is it?\\n\\nCASTILLO: Oh, man. Stressing out.\\n\\nSAGAL: We're doing that, but Bill was being very specific just then. He was doing something that we have all done, especially people who live by themselves during lockdown.\\n\\nCASTILLO: Talking to themselves?\\n\\nSAGAL: Yes, talking to themselves.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\\n\\nSAGAL: More and more people are talking to themselves during the pandemic since there really isn't anybody else to talk to. In fact, I'm not saying this to any of you. I'm saying it to myself. People tend to talk out loud more when they're under stress, even when they're alone as a way of examining and organizing what's happening inside their heads. That's why you're always saying out loud, yes, Netflix, I'm still watching.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: So did a psychologists say anything about doing other things to yourself...\\n\\nSAGAL: (Laughter).\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: ...During quarantine?\\n\\nHIGGINS: Out loud (laughter).\\n\\nSAGAL: Not in the family websites we were reading.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDICKINSON: I've got some questions from my advice column from people worried about talking to themselves. Yeah, it's definitely a phenomenon.\\n\\nSAGAL: Are people worried that they're losing their minds?\\n\\nDICKINSON: Well, the one question that I published, yeah. She said, am I OK? Like, is this - and turns out it can be useful, actually.\\n\\nSAGAL: Yeah.\\n\\nDICKINSON: You know, you're keeping yourself company. You're telling - you're narrating your life. There's nothing wrong with that.\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: Yeah. I think it's pretty crazy to talk to yourself. That's why I've dressed up a body pillow.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nKIM BOOSTER: I address the body pillow.\\n\\nSAGAL: I was about to say if you're worried about it, all you need to do is paint a face on a volleyball with blood and talk to that, and you'll win an Oscar.\\n\\nBill, how did Gabriel do on our quiz?\\n\\nKURTIS: Gabriel got them all right. Congratulations, Gabriel.\\n\\nCASTILLO: Thank you, guys.\\n\\nSAGAL: Congratulations. Thanks a lot, Gabriel. Thanks for calling.\\n\\nCASTILLO: Bye.\\n\\nSAGAL: Bye.\\n\\nDICKINSON: Bye.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump Takes A Last Look At His Border Wall As Congress Considers Impeachment\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday\\n\\nPresident Trump went to Texas on Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to show off one of his signature election promises — the border wall — as Democratic lawmakers appear ready to move forward with impeaching him for a second time.\\n\\nHe has about a week left in office, but angry lawmakers are calling on him to resign after a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday as a joint session of Congress met inside to certify the results of the election.\\n\\nThe aftermath of the riot overshadowed Trump's efforts to change the subject. Even as he signed a plaque on the border wall and praised his own work curbing immigration, the FBI provided an update on its efforts to arrest the violent Trump supporters.\\n\\nTrump brushed aside the moves in Congress to hold him accountable, saying the 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me and casting the push for impeachment as part of a political effort by his political opponents to hurt him.\\n\\nDuring the visit to Alamo — a small town in the Rio Grande Valley — Trump talked about his efforts to curb immigration, including the hundreds of miles of border wall constructed during his time in office, and measures to stop asylum-seekers.\\n\\nIt was the first public appearance for Trump — beyond video statements — since Wednesday morning, when he urged his supporters to head to the Capitol as Congress formalized President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\\n\\nPolitical analysts said it was an obvious attempt to try to rehabilitate his image when his legacy is at stake.\\n\\nEvery president tries to burnish his legacy by highlighting perceived successes in the final days, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's problem among many is that this trip will be completely overshadowed by the fallout from last week.\\n\\nTrump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigration. The clearest example of that was his promise to build a big, beautiful wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — a core issue for his base.\\n\\nMost mainstream Republicans would prefer if Trump just faded away quietly, said Sean Walsh, a Republican strategist who worked in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush White Houses.\\n\\nBut Walsh said this trip makes clear that Trump does not plan to do so. And Walsh is concerned that Trump could make things worse by picking such a hot-button issue.\\n\\nI could see if he did not temper his remarks, whipping some activists up, Walsh said. So I think we have to keep our eyes and ears very closely peeled on President Trump.\\n\\nThe latest Quinnipiac University survey taken after the attack finds Trump's job approval has plunged 11 points since December, falling to 33% – the lowest it has been since August 2017.\\n\\nConant said the political backlash from the Capitol riot is likely too great for Trump to overcome. He said the president's refusal to concede the election and willingness to stoke conspiracy theories all but ensured he will be remembered for the bitter end to his time in office instead of his policy accomplishments, such as tax cuts and the naming of three Supreme Court justices.\\n\\nI think until Donald Trump properly concedes the election and recognizes Joe Biden as the president-elect, he's not going to be able to talk about anything else, Conant said. And his legacy is losing potency by the hour."}

Details about the corrections are at the end of this post.\\n\\nMost American school children learn that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, leading us to join World War II. This week marks the 75th anniversary of Japanese-Americans being subsequently rounded up and interned as suspected enemies of the state. But there's another tragic and untold story of American citizens who were also interned during the war. I'm a member of the Ahtna tribe of Alaska and I've spent the better part of 30 years uncovering and putting together fragments of a story that deserves to be told.\\n\\nIn June 1942, Japan invaded and occupied Kiska and Attu, the westernmost islands of Alaska's Aleutian Chain, an archipelago of 69 islands stretching some 1,200 miles across the North Pacific Ocean toward Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. From a strategic perspective, Japan wanted to close what they perceived as America's back door to the Far East. For thousands of years, the islands have been inhabited by a resourceful indigenous people called Aleuts. During the Russian-American Period (1733 to 1867), when Alaska was a colonial possession of Russia, Russian fur-seekers decimated Aleut populations through warfare, disease, and slavery.\\n\\nShortly after Japan's invasion, American naval personnel arrived with orders to round up and evacuate Aleuts from the Aleutian Chain and the Pribilof Islands to internment camps almost 2,000 miles away near Juneau. Stewardship of the internment camps would fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USF&WS).\\n\\nThe Army's stated purpose was to protect the Aleuts, who were American citizens, from the dangers of war.\\n\\nAll told, 881 Aleuts from nine different island villages were transported to abandoned salmon canneries where some roofs and walls had holes, some windows and doors were broken, and some floors were rotted. Electricity, sanitation and running water were scant – or nonexistent.\\n\\nThe Aleuts were interned against their will for the duration of the war, long after the Japanese were routed out of Alaska, and were largely neglected by the very government that said it was protecting them. Ironically, less than 30 miles away, over 700 Nazis who had been captured in North Africa were imprisoned at a POW camp at Excursion Inlet. The Nazis, sworn enemies of America and our allies, were treated far better than the Aleuts, so much so that military historian Stan Cohen later wrote in The Forgotten War, All in all, the German imprisonment in Alaska was quite pleasant.\\n\\nIn May 1943, the United States government even enslaved many of the men from the Pribilof Islands. The government threatened that none of the Aleuts would ever be allowed to go home (even after the war) if the men didn't volunteer to harvest fur seals for the war effort. By international treaty, only Native Pribilovians could harvest fur seals. They were told the furs would be made into liners for aviation jackets and helmets for American pilots and bomber crews, which was a lie. The men spent the summer sealing season on the tiny Pribilof Islands clubbing over 125,000 seals. The government sold the furs to the Fouke Fur Company of St. Louis, Mo., for $1.5 million in profits, all of which went straight into the government's coffers.\\n\\nThe Japanese invasion of Alaska never made it very far beyond the westernmost Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu. Over a period of 15 months, American soldiers eventually recaptured the mountainous islands in a series of battles which came to be known as the Forgotten War. In all, half a million soldiers — American, Canadian, Russian, and Japanese — were involved in the conflict, one of the least known yet toughest-fought battles in WWII, as explained by Brian Garfield in The Thousand Mile War. Some of the most horrific accounts of hand-to-hand combat in World War II happened at the end, when over 500 Japanese soldiers, unwilling to surrender or to be taken alive after a desperate banzai (suicide) attack, blew themselves up en masse with hand grenades at the foot of Engineer Hill.\\n\\nThe war in the Aleutians gave America its first theater-wide victory over Japan and the first experience at amphibious assaults in the war. Some 118 Aleuts perished from lack of warmth, food, and medical care. Smaller Aleut villages lost as much as a quarter of their pre-internment population. The Aleut deaths were avoidable. Medical supplies that had been allocated for the internment camps were instead taken by the military.

The issue is big in Detroit, where water had been turned off if a customer hadn't paid.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nThe $900 billion coronavirus aid package out of Congress includes funding for low-income households that need help getting water. This is a big issue in Detroit, where officials recently committed to ending the city's water shutoffs, at least until 2022. From member station WDET, Eli Newman reports on how the pandemic brought a change in policy.\\n\\nMONICA LEWIS-PATRICK: All right, water warriors.\\n\\nELI NEWMAN, BYLINE: It's a cool day in Corktown. Volunteers are unloading packages of water bottles from a blue Absopure truck as they get ready to deliver them to residents across the city. They're with We the People of Detroit. Monica Lewis-Patrick has led the group over the last six years.\\n\\nLEWIS-PATRICK: Because what we know is that since 2014, over 161,000 households have been shut off from water in the city of Detroit.\\n\\nNEWMAN: Lewis-Patrick says she was not surprised about the collision of two public health emergencies - water shutoffs and the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nLEWIS-PATRICK: You've had decades of divestment and oppression and capitalistic agendas taking precedence over people. So we're not shocked in Detroit.\\n\\nNEWMAN: On March 9, the day before Michigan reported its first case of COVID-19, officials in Detroit suspended the city-led shutoffs over health concerns, and they announced a plan to restart water at homes. Detroit Water Department Director Gary Brown says since then, 1,300 occupied homes have had their service restored. And now the city has enough funding to keep the water on.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGARY BROWN: We are continuing the moratorium through 2022 while we work on a permanent water affordability solution at the state and federal level.\\n\\nNEWMAN: Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib says she is pleased that Congress' coronavirus relief package includes $638 million in water assistance, but she wants the measures to go further. Tlaib estimates 15 million Americans experienced a water shutoff before the pandemic. Officials in Detroit are still exploring what the federal aid means for its local relief efforts. But not everyone is convinced about the plan to stop the water shutoffs. Monica Lewis-Patrick says the city does not have to wait two years.\\n\\nLEWIS-PATRICK: We're cautiously optimistic, but we are waiting to see the proof in the pudding.\\n\\nNEWMAN: Demeeko Williams leads Hydrate Detroit, another water accessibility group. He says he won't be satisfied with the solution unless it includes water relief amnesty.\\n\\nDEMEEKO WILLIAMS: You erase the debt clean and you zero out all the residents, homeowners that have high water bills back to zero so that we can start over.\\n\\nNEWMAN: President-elect Joe Biden has said that no one should have their water shut off during the pandemic. But the issue is still pervasive in Detroit. Officials say, despite relief, 18,000 households in the city still regularly struggle to keep their water running.\\n\\nFor NPR News, I'm Eli Newman in Detroit.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF KORESMA'S NEW FRONTIER)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Trump Pushes For Wall Amid Shutdown, Says There's 'A Crisis Of The Heart' At Border\\n\\nUpdated at 11:27 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump made his case to the American people Tuesday night for why a massive wall along the Mexican border is necessary, using his first Oval Office address to outline his conditions for ending the 18-day-and-counting partial government shutdown.\\n\\nThis is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul, Trump said, explaining why his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall and for additional border security measures is necessary.\\n\\nThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. ... The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government, the president said.\\n\\nTrump's address Tuesday night seemed, at least in part, a way to reassure nervous Republicans about the political cost of the shutdown, some of whom may be wavering as more impacts from the partial closure of the government ripple across the country. Trump and Vice President Pence will meet with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, and on Thursday Trump will visit the border to continue his media blitz. But in the nearly three-week-long shutdown, there still is no clear path to a resolution anytime soon, as both Trump and Democratic congressional leaders in their rebuttal offered nothing new beyond the arguments they've been making since last month.\\n\\nUnlike at his campaign rallies, Trump didn't begin his Oval Office address with his push for a wall. Instead, he first outlined what he says is an urgent need to address a growing number of migrants trying to cross the border and to address drugs coming across illegally.\\n\\nLast month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system, Trump said.\\n\\nTrump also claimed that the Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs and that it was necessary to stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\\n\\nHowever, an NPR fact check found that according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry and only a small fraction comes through parts of the Southern border that would be impacted by a wall.\\n\\nTrump also tried to make an emotional plea, pointing as he often has to crimes and slayings committed by undocumented immigrants as another reason stricter border security is necessary.\\n\\nHow much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken? Trump asked, framing his argument as a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.\\n\\nHowever, studies show undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has tried to establish a link between terrorism and the situation at the Southern border, and on Tuesday night Trump said a barrier is absolutely critical to national security. But he and his allies have often exaggerated the threat or simply used inaccurate or misleading statistics to do so. While there has been a spike in Southern border crossings in the past few months — largely children and families fleeing violence in Central America — overall illegal crossings are lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and far lower than their peak around 2000.\\n\\nTrump also tried to make the argument that the wall would be paid for, indirectly, by Mexico thanks to a new trade deal he has negotiated to replace NAFTA. However, that new deal has not been ratified by Congress, and as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported, there's no guarantee the economic gains could pay for the wall and the White House has not explained its math to back up that claim.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders also claimed last week that Customs and Border Protection picked up almost 4,000 suspected terrorists along the Southern border, but NBC News found those stops have largely been made at airports. During the first half of fiscal year 2018, CBP stopped just six immigrants at ports of entry on the Southern border who were on a federal terrorist watchlist, NBC also found.\\n\\nTrump asked for more funding for cutting age technology, more Border Patrol agents (who are currently working but not being paid since the Department of Homeland Security is subject to the partial shutdown) and for more immigration judges.\\n\\nThe president also claimed that at the request of Democrats any wall would be a steel barrier. However, that has not been a condition from Democrats. Rather, after long pushing for a concrete wall, Trump recently shifted to talking about using steel slats to build a barrier on the Southern border, hoping that might convince some Democrats, but it has not.\\n\\nDemocrats have remained in staunch opposition to any contingencies on reopening the government, arguing their victories in the midterm elections and public polling have shown the country doesn't want a wall. In their response following Trump's address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\\n\\nThe fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation — many of them veterans, Pelosi said. He promised to keep government shut down for 'months or years' — no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.\\n\\nPelosi also pushed back on Trump's claims, saying that the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge — a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.\\n\\nWatch The Democratic Response\\n\\nTrump has said he won't sign any bill to reopen the government, about a quarter of which was shuttered on Dec. 22, unless Congress acquiesces to his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall — Trump's central campaign promise that received raucous applause at his rallies, albeit with the caveat that Mexico would pay for the barrier. Last month, Trump said he would be proud to shut down the government over border security and would gladly take the mantle. However, since the partial shutdown became a reality, he has tried to shift the blame to Democrats.\\n\\nTuesday night Schumer challenged Trump to reopen the government while continuing to negotiate on border security.\\n\\nWe can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy, the Senate minority leader said. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\\n\\nLast week, House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate won't take it up — even though the Senate passed identical legislation last month before Trump reasserted his desire for billions in funding for a border wall.\\n\\nIn a statement after the address, McConnell remained firmly behind Trump and sought to foist blame back on Democrats.\\n\\nThe past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president, the Senate majority leader said. For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution."}
{"original": "New York State Sues NYPD Over Its Handling Of 2020 Racial Justice Protests\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 3 p.m. ET\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the New York City Police Department, citing a pattern of using excessive force and making false arrests against New Yorkers during peaceful protests that sought racial justice and other changes.\\n\\nThe Black Lives Matter movement and other activists organized large protests across the country last year, after the Memorial Day death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Demonstrations grew over similar incidents, including the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky.\\n\\nJames' office says it has received more than 1,300 complaints and pieces of evidence about the police response to the protests in New York City. It's now seeking a court order declaring that the policies and practices that the NYPD used during these protests were unlawful.\\n\\nAlong with the court order, the attorney general is asking for policy reforms and a monitor to oversee the NYPD's tactics and handling of future protests.\\n\\nThe NYPD has been sharply criticized over a number of its officers' actions in the past year. A video last May apparently showed police SUVs surging into a crowd that had surrounded them during a protest in Brooklyn. In another incident, an officer drew his gun and pointed it at a crowd of people.\\n\\nAnd in July, plainclothes officers were seen on video as they aggressively detained a woman at a protest and hauled her away in an unmarked vehicle, as NPR reported.\\n\\nThere is no question that the NYPD engaged in a pattern of excessive, brutal, and unlawful force against peaceful protesters, James said. Over the past few months, the NYPD has repeatedly and blatantly violated the rights of New Yorkers, inflicting significant physical and psychological harm and leading to great distrust in law enforcement.\\n\\nWith today's lawsuit, James said, this longstanding pattern of brutal and illegal force ends. No one is above the law — not even the individuals charged with enforcing it.\\n\\nThe police actions broke state and federal law, James says. The lawsuit alleges that New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea and NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan failed to prevent and address the pattern or practice of excessive force and false arrests by officers against peaceful protesters in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution as well as state laws.\\n\\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, NYPD and de Blasio made similar statements, saying plans to reform the police department are already under way.\\n\\nThe New York City Police Department welcomes reform and has embraced the recent suggestions by both the city's Department of Investigation and the city's Law Department, a department spokesperson said via email. As the Mayor has said, adding another layer does not speed up the process of continued reform, which we have embraced and led the way on.\\n\\nThe Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York also issued a statement, blaming the city's leadership for problems at the protests.\\n\\nThey sent cops out to police unprecedented protests and violent riots with no plan, no strategy and no support, PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said.\\n\\nNew York's attorney general announced the lawsuit against the NYPD Thursday morning in a virtual news conference that began shortly before New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo delivered his annual State of the State address. Cuomo called on James — who is elected, not appointed – to investigate NYPD's response to the protests last May.\\n\\nLast night, we saw disturbing violent clashes amid protests in Brooklyn, Cuomo said when he announced his request for an inquiry. He added, The public deserves answers and accountability.\\n\\nLast June, the NYPD suspended at least two officers for their behavior during protests, including an officer who was captured on video pushing a woman to the ground in Brooklyn. Another officer was punished for pulling down an individual's face mask in Brooklyn and spraying pepper spray at him, as ABC7 New York reported.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch, an independent watchdog group, issued a report last year on the police misconduct in Brooklyn. According to the report, clearly identified medics and legal observers were among those zip-tied and beaten by police in a response that was intentional, planned, and unjustified.\\n\\nThe lawsuit says the police department sent thousands of poorly trained officers to cope with large-scale protests, resulting in mass arrests and attempts to suppress demonstrations. It also says the NYPD made a practice out of kettling — corralling people by using physical force and obstructions — to arrest protesters rather than allowing crowds to disperse.\\n\\nAs the Gothamist website reports:\\n\\nThe NYPD has already been under the oversight of a federal monitor for more than six years. The federal monitor, Peter Zimroth, was ordered by the court to oversee sweeping stop-and-frisk reforms. The department's work to reform stop-and-frisk practices, and address racial biases in policing, is ongoing. The monitor has not yet deemed the NYPD to be fully in compliance with reforms.\\n\\nA Minnesota judge ruled this week that Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes, will stand trial alone when proceedings begin in March. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter."}
{"original": "What's Changed Between U.S. And North Korea Since First Summit\\n\\nPresident Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will meet for a second time next week. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with North Korea expert Frank Aum about what's changed since the last meeting.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nIf all goes to plan, one week from today, President Trump will be in Hanoi, Vietnam, preparing to sit down for a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. So far, this one is coming together with decidedly less drama than the first time these two met. You may recall just days before last year's summit in Singapore, Trump called it off. And then, suddenly, it was back on.\\n\\nThis time, Trump's tone is less heated and on the substance and the central U.S. demand that North Korea give up nuclear weapons. The president has been tempering expectations.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As long as there's no testing, I'm in no rush. If there's testing, that's another deal. But there has been no testing.\\n\\nKELLY: So where does that leave expectations for this summit? In our studio to discuss is Frank Aum. He was senior adviser for North Korea at the Defense Department during the Obama administration. Welcome.\\n\\nFRANK AUM: Good to be here.\\n\\nKELLY: So start with what we just heard from the president. First, just a quick fact check - he's right. There's been no testing since the Singapore summit, correct?\\n\\nAUM: Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nKELLY: OK. And when you hear him say he's in no rush, what should we read into that?\\n\\nAUM: Well, I'm speculating here, but I think he is trying to create the impression that he is not desperate for denuclearization - that he can walk away from a deal if it's not good for the U.S. I don't think that was the best way to phrase it because it sends the wrong message that the U.S. government is OK with a nuclear North Korea as long as it doesn't conduct provocations.\\n\\nKELLY: I was going to ask, isn't he desperate for North Korea to denuclearize? I mean, that has been the U.S. position for many years now when negotiating with North Korea - was the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.\\n\\nAUM: Well, I think President Trump certainly is looking for a foreign policy victory. And it's interesting that you've seen a radical shift in his policy towards North Korea over the last six months. And I think that's probably, actually, a helpful indication of what's to come at Hanoi.\\n\\nKELLY: Explain that. What's the radical shift you see?\\n\\nAUM: So previous administrations and the Trump administration, at least earlier on, had always said that they demanded denuclearization from North Korea first, before they would be willing to discuss peace and normalization.\\n\\nBut in the remarks from Stephen Biegun, who's the special representative for North Korea - he made remarks at Stanford a few weeks ago. And he said that the U.S. is committed to pursuing denuclearization, but also peace talks in parallel. And that would be a marked shift from the policy that we've pursued in the past.\\n\\nKELLY: So if I'm hearing you right, it sounds as though, in your view, the U.S. is walking into this summit with a radically different starting point than it did last year at the Singapore summit.\\n\\nAUM: Absolutely. Before the Singapore summit, President Trump described it by saying that it would be a get-to-know-you meeting, plus. So that sounded very superficial, just establishing a relationship with Kim Jong Un. So I had very - actually had very low expectations out of Singapore.\\n\\nWe're now eight months later. I think a lot of the ideas have had a chance to marinate a little bit more. You're hearing more reports about potential concessions from both sides. That gives us a little more optimism going into Hanoi.\\n\\nKELLY: With that as backdrop, what does the U.S. want from this summit in Vietnam next week? What would count as a U.S. win?\\n\\nAUM: Tangible outcome - so we need to see something that demonstrates that North Korea is denuclearizing. One, I think, right off the bat is to reaffirm their dismantlement of their nuclear test site at Punggye-ri and the missile test site at Tongchang-ri. Also, the permanent dismantlement of their main nuclear facility - that would be a big step.\\n\\nTo go even further, a commitment to freeze or cap their production of fissile material and ballistic missiles - that would be a significant win for us as well.\\n\\nKELLY: What does North Korea want?\\n\\nAUM: Right now, their main interest is to get some sanctions relief. I don't think we need to give up all of the sanctions immediately or dismantle it, but I think it would be helpful to get some initial steps.\\n\\nAlso, they would very much appreciate a declaration confirming that the Korean War is officially over. That would be something that Kim Jong Un could take to his domestic public to convince them that there's a new environment on the peninsula.\\n\\nKELLY: So bottom line - you said you were skeptical about the Singapore summit. Where are you a week or so out from Vietnam?\\n\\nAUM: Well, I think it's a fool's choice to be too optimistic about progress, especially in the context of North Korea. But I don't think we need to swing for the fences here. I think a single is good enough, as long as we keep the rally going for diplomatic momentum. I think that would be a success.\\n\\nKELLY: Frank Aum, former senior Pentagon adviser. He's now with the U.S. Institute of Peace. Thank you.\\n\\nAUM: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Their earlier report said it likely will take place in Vietnam, either Hanoi or Da Nang, probably in March.\\n\\nGREENE: So pretty soon - what is laying the foundation for the two countries to want to hold another summit? I mean, since Kim Jong Un and President Trump met in June, I mean, has either side actually gotten anything?\\n\\nDIMAGGIO: Well, since Singapore, which is now over seven months ago, there really has been very little concrete progress. It's more or less been a photo op on the world stage. So I think the second summit is an opportunity for the U.S. to come to the table and try to formulate a policy going forward that will actually end up with results.\\n\\nI think the U.S. failed to do the diplomatic work prior to and following the Singapore summit to capitalize on this breakthrough. And we shouldn't repeat that same mistake in the lead-up to a second summit. There's still time to do that.\\n\\nDIMAGGIO: So talking about repeating mistakes. I mean, if the Trump administration does not do the important diplomatic work that you're talking about and if this is seen as another, quote, unquote, photo op, does it start to get dangerous? Like, you're giving Kim kind of, you know, these photo opportunities on the world stage and seeming like he's important and, you know, in talks with the United States but not having to actually do anything to denuclearize.\\n\\nDIMAGGIO: Well, after this meeting in Washington, the U.S. special rep for North Korea, Steve Biegun, reportedly will fly to Stockholm, where he'll meet his counterpart. And these two people will be responsible for negotiating the details of anything that comes out of the summit. So that's a good and positive development. And that should be a series of very intense meetings over time up until the summit. We'll see if that happens.\\n\\nI mean, on the upside, we've seen a sharp reduction in tension, no talk of fire and fury. But without progress soon, we can see easily slipping toward a ratcheting tension quickly. And that's one thing that worries me. What do we do then when it seems like diplomacy has been exhausted?\\n\\nGREENE: Suzanne DiMaggio is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nDIMAGGIO: My pleasure. Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Federal Immigration Agents Separated More Migrant Children Than Previously Thought\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andres Leighton/AP Andres Leighton/AP\\n\\nFor nearly a year before family separation became an official and controversial policy of the Trump administration in the spring of 2018, federal immigration agents separated thousands of migrant children from their parents. That's according to a government watchdog report released Thursday.\\n\\nOIG found more children over a longer period of time were separated by immigration authorities and referred to HHS for care than is commonly discussed in public debate. How many more children were separated is unknown by us and HHS, Ann Maxwell, assistant inspector general for evaluations at the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters.\\n\\nShe said HHS officials estimated the number of children was in the thousands but would not give a more exact figure.\\n\\nThe report is the first official U.S. government acknowledgment that the Trump administration was using family separation as a measure to deter illegal immigration nearly a year before it became official DHS policy. NPR and other media were reporting the increase of family separations at the border in early 2018.\\n\\nBeginning in the summer of 2017, before the formal announcement of the [Trump administration's] zero tolerance policy, ORR saw a steep increase in the number of children who had been separated from a parent or guardian by the Department of Homeland Security, according to an OIG press release.\\n\\nThat means the Trump administration was engaged in an aggressive and unannounced policy to separate families well before the issue exploded into the headlines in April 2018. That's when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that all parents who crossed the border illegally would be prosecuted for immigration violations, and the government would take their children into custody. Reports of wrenching scenes in border detention cells where uniformed agents pulled hysterically crying children away from parents sparked a public outcry that prompted the administration to abruptly discontinue the policy three months later in June.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security maintains that the uptick in family separations in summer 2017 was a reflection of the higher numbers of undocumented immigrant families arriving at the U.S. border asking for entry.\\n\\nThe (OIG) report vindicates what DHS has long been saying: for more than a decade it was and continues to be standard for apprehended minors to be separated when the adult is not the parent or legal guardian or the child's safety is at risk, said DHS spokesperson Katie Waldman. For the HHS OIG to claim it was not known that DHS is actively enforcing this policy in the same manner for more than a decade ... casts doubt on the HHS OIG's credibility on this topic.\\n\\nA federal lawsuit resulted in the government identifying a class of 2,737 children who had been separated from their families between May and June 2018. However, this number does not represent the full scope of family separations, according to the OIG statement.\\n\\nUnder orders of a federal judge in California, HHS has now reunited nearly all of those 2,737 children with parents or released them to relatives living in the country. Moreover, the Office of Inspector General says the thousands of children who were removed from their parents starting in the summer of 2017 were all discharged from government custody before zero tolerance went into effect.\\n\\nImmigrant advocacy organizations such as the Women's Refugee Commission said at the time, We began to hear a noticeable increase in this practice in the summer [of 2017]. Moreover, 74 congressional Democrats sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen denouncing family separation as unlawful and immoral.\\n\\nIn response to the report, Lee Gelernt, lead attorney and deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said: This policy was a cruel disaster from the start. This report reaffirms that the government never had a clear picture of how many children it ripped from their parents. We will be back in court over this latest revelation."}
{"original": "Health Savings Account Change In 2018 Could Trip Up Some Consumers\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fanatic Studio/Collection Mix: Subjects RF/Getty Images Fanatic Studio/Collection Mix: Subjects RF/Getty Images\\n\\nMembers of Congress have said they want to loosen rules for health savings accounts. Did they do it in the latest spending bill? Do people who were uncovered for one month in 2017 owe a tax penalty? And how can immigrants who move to the U.S. to retire get insurance? These are the questions I'm tackling for readers this week:\\n\\nI heard that health savings account rules would be loosened under the new spending bill passed by Congress last month. Did that happen?\\n\\nNo. In fact, the standards have become slightly tighter this year.\\n\\nIn recent years, members of Congress from both parties have supported expanding eligibility for health savings accounts and also expanding the list of ways that money can be spent. To date, though, those proposals, as well as other changes regarding the accounts, haven't become law.\\n\\nHealth savings accounts, which are linked to high-deductible health plans, continue to multiply. In 2017, there were 22 million accounts totaling more than $45 billion in assets, an increase of 11 percent in the number of accounts over the previous year, according to Devenir, a firm that offers advice on HSA investments.\\n\\nMoney deposited in HSAs is tax-deductible, grows tax-free and can be used without owing tax to pay for medical expenses. Advocates promote the plans as a way to help consumers play a larger role in controlling their health spending, and say that the tax advantages help people afford care.\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Service announced last month that the maximum amount individuals with family coverage could contribute to their health savings accounts would actually be reduced slightly from their previously announced limit for 2018. The maximum contribution for people with individual coverage in 2018 remains $3,450.\\n\\nThe family coverage contribution reduction of $50 — from $6,900 to $6,850 – isn't much of a change. It happened because the federal government altered the way it calculates inflation adjustments to the contribution limits.\\n\\nBut ignoring the new limit could create headaches for people who have already made the maximum HSA contribution for the year based on the $6,900 figure, says Roy Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting Services. If you don't ask the bank that handles your HSA to return the $50 plus any earnings that have accrued before the next tax season, your taxable income will be off by that amount, plus you'll be on the hook for a 6 percent penalty for exceeding the maximum contribution allowed.\\n\\nThat's not going to amount to a lot of money, but there's more than financial pain to consider, Ramthun says. Do you really want to give the IRS a reason to come find you?\\n\\nI didn't have health insurance for one month last year, in January 2017. Do I owe a penalty for not having health insurance when I file my taxes this spring?\\n\\nIf you were uninsured for only one month in 2017, you won't owe a penalty. People can be uninsured for up to three consecutive months during the year without triggering a tax penalty for not having coverage, says Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\\n\\nThis year, for the first time, the Internal Revenue Service won't accept electronically filed tax returns unless filers report whether they had health insurance all year, were exempt from the requirement or will pay a penalty for not having had coverage. Any tax refund, too, may be delayed if it is tied to a paper return that doesn't have this information, according to the IRS.\\n\\nIn your case, you'll file federal form 8965 with your tax return to report a short-term insurance coverage gap and claim an exemption from the coverage requirement. Your employer — or your insurer, if you purchased coverage on your own — will send a form to the IRS stating that you were covered for the other 11 months, Straw says.\\n\\nThose penalties — $695 or 2.5 percent of your household income, whichever is greater — are also in force for 2018 coverage. But starting next year, you won't owe a penalty no matter how long you may be uninsured. The tax reform law eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance in 2019.\\n\\nWhat health insurance options are available for my parents, who are seniors who worked in India and are now retired in the United States with green cards?\\n\\nDepending on their situation, people like your parents who are legally entitled to reside permanently in the United States have a number of options.\\n\\nFrom your description, it's unclear whether they live on their own or with you. If you claim them as dependents on your taxes, you might consider adding them to your own health insurance plan, says Shelby Gonzales, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\\n\\nAssuming your parents haven't worked for at least 10 years in the United States, they're probably not eligible for premium-free hospitalization coverage under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older, Gonzales says. If they've lived in the States for at least five years and their income and other resources meet state eligibility guidelines, however, they could qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people.\\n\\nIf they don't qualify for either government health program, they could consider buying a health insurance plan on the state marketplace or through a broker.\\n\\nIf they buy a marketplace plan, they could be eligible for premium subsidies if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $66,000 for a couple in 2018), says Gabrielle Lessard, a senior policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

{"original": "Clinton Warns Against 'Inflammatory, Anti-Muslim Rhetoric'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tony Dejak/AP Tony Dejak/AP\\n\\nThe day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton warned against the possibility of future attacks and went after Donald Trump for inflammatory rhetoric.\\n\\nThe threat is metastasizing, Clinton said in a speech in Cleveland. We saw this in Paris, and we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves: radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.\\n\\nClinton laid out several different policy options, including enhanced intelligence sharing among federal and local law enforcement, additional training and financial resources for first responders, and more aggressive international efforts to freeze terrorists' ability to send money, arms and operatives around the world.\\n\\nThe crowd in Cleveland cheered loudest when Clinton pushed for expanded gun control. I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets, she said, pointing out that the Orlando, San Bernardino and Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings were all carried out using AR-15 rifles. We have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war. ... And that may not stop every shooting, or every terrorist attack. But it will stop some, and it will save lives, and it will protect our first responders.\\n\\nThis is a moment when all Americans need to stand together, Clinton said. The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination, and pride in our country and our values.\\n\\nOn a day when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump doubled down on calls for a temporary immigration ban for all Muslims, Clinton warned against what she called inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric.\\n\\nThreatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country, she continued, hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.\\n\\nReferencing the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Clinton recalled President George W. Bush's visit to a Muslim community center. To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, that would not and should not stand in America.\\n\\nIt is time to get back to the spirit of those days, Clinton said.\\n\\nClinton also alluded to the fact that the FBI investigated shooter Omar Mateen on more than one occasion. If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked, she said to loud cheers.\\n\\nClinton said she'd make identifying and stopping 'lone wolves' a top priority. She defined them as radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.\\n\\nThat may be easier said than done. Shortly before Clinton spoke in Cleveland, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that alleged shooter Mateen had been the subject of two different federal investigations, including an extensive probe that lasted 10 months. Neither investigation turned up evidence that the FBI could act on."}
{"original": "Study: Holding Kids Back A Grade Doesn't Necessarily Hold Them Back\\n\\nEnlarge this image Chelsea Beck/NPR Chelsea Beck/NPR\\n\\nOur education system has this funny quirk of grouping kids by birth date — rather than, say, intellectual ability or achievement or interest.\\n\\nBut developmental pathways are as individual as kids themselves.\\n\\nAnd so there's a perpetual back-and-forth about whether to put certain kids in school a grade behind or ahead of their actual age.\\n\\nRecently we covered the research on redshirting, or the practice of starting kindergarten a little late. That researcher concluded that it's usually better to go ahead and enroll kids as soon as they're old enough. For one thing, they will earn more money on average over a lifetime with that head start into the workforce.\\n\\nNow comes a big study to say something different: Holding kids back at third grade when they don't meet the academic standards will give them a boost in achievement, by some measures. And, it doesn't affect their likelihood of finishing high school.\\n\\nNationwide, about one in 10 children must repeat at least one grade, and they tend to be disproportionately low-income or come from minority groups. Following on the stereotype of the too-tall kid crammed into a too-small desk in the back row, previous research has looked at the potential downsides of grade retention: stigma, peer group mismatch and reduced expectations from teachers.\\n\\nThis study adds a counterbalance: If students get proper help and attention, they may be able to improve on low performance, given a little extra time.\\n\\nGuido Schwerdt of the University of Konstanz in Germany, Martin West of Harvard, and Marcus Winters of Boston University, followed the fates of almost a million Florida students who were in third grade in 2002-2003. That year, in the wake of the federal No Child Left Behind law, the state put in a policy that all students who missed the mark on the third-grade state reading test would be automatically left back and given remediation. A total of 16 states plus the District of Columbia have such a rule.\\n\\nThe authors compared Florida students who just passed the reading test with those who just missed it and were held back. They looked at their test scores for eight more school years in reading and six more in math, plus high school transcripts and graduation figures.\\n\\nThe students who were held back did better in the first few years. Over time, the effects faded, but they still had higher GPAs and took fewer remedial courses in high school.\\n\\nUltimately, though, there was no discernible impact on high school graduation rates. This is significant, because being overage for one's grade has long been considered in itself a risk factor for dropping out.\\n\\nAs Harvard's Martin West notes, the results are mixed – and therefore disappointing for the policy's proponents, especially since holding students back is costly. On the other hand, he adds, the worst fears of critics were not borne out by the results.\\n\\nIt's important to note here that not every student who scored too low was held back. English language learners and special education students, for example, were generally promoted anyway, and teachers have discretion to promote general education students who they think can succeed in the next grade.\\n\\nWest says what he really wonders about is why the left-back students, who make demonstrable academic gains, still do no better when it comes to high school graduation. The big question for me is what happened in high school such that better preparation did not translate into improved outcomes."}
{"original": "Birth Control Apps Find A Big Market In 'Contraception Deserts'\\n\\nEnlarge this image Paige Vickers for NPR Paige Vickers for NPR\\n\\nRachel Ralph works long hours at an accounting firm in Oakland, Calif., and coordinates much of her life via the apps on her phone.\\n\\nSo when she first heard several months ago that she could order her usual brand of birth control pills via an app and have them delivered to her doorstep in a day or two, it seemed perfect. She was working 12-hour days.\\n\\nFood was delivered; dinner was often delivered, Ralph says. Anything I could get sent to my house with little effort — the better.\\n\\nRalph ordered a three-month supply of pills via the app of a San Francisco-based company called NURX. It's one of several digital ventures, including Maven and Lemonaid Health, that now provide several types of hormonal contraception without requiring a live visit to a doctor or other health care provider.\\n\\nWomen using these services in cities say they like the speed and no-hassle privacy they get by making a purchase through the app. And in some rural areas where women's health clinics are few and far between, being able to buy prescription contraceptives online — starting at around $15 for a month's supply — can be not only much more private, but much more affordable and less time-consuming than driving an hour or more to the closest clinic, or paying for a doctor's appointment.\\n\\nNURX is now available in 18 states. It's popular in Texas, where many women live in what some health policy analysts call contraception deserts — places that lack easy access to women's health services.\\n\\nThe company's process is pretty simple. After users log in to the NURX app, they fill out a questionnaire.\\n\\nThey tell us about their medical history, says Jessica Horowitz, a nurse practitioner with NURX who consults with patients via online chats. They give us a blood-pressure check.\\n\\nA clinician like Horowitz then reviews the answers and, based on that, makes a suggestion about what type of hormonal contraception might be best for that individual; a pill, a ring or a patch are available, as well as emergency contraception. If the patient has a question about the product she's considering, she can send an instant message or call to chat with a provider.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter what time of day it is, Horowitz says. Someone responds.\\n\\nThen NURX sends a prescription to a pharmacy and the drugs are mailed out via priority mail, or faster for emergency contraception. The cost of a month's supply of prescription birth control is often free to patients, if they have health insurance, Horowitz says, and otherwise starts at $15 out-of-pocket for a month's supply, depending on the brand.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Maryam Fikri/NURX Courtesy of Maryam Fikri/NURX\\n\\nFor Claire Hammons, who lives and works in Llano, Texas, about 90 minutes outside Austin, the low cost of the pills was as important as the convenience.\\n\\nHammons loves many aspects of life in her small town. There is a population of 3,000 people, she says. But we have a lot going on. We are a huge art town. We have the Llano River. We are surrounded by state parks.\\n\\nStill, living there has its drawbacks, she says. There's no women's health clinic nearby, and getting prescription contraceptives isn't easy, especially without health insurance. And for Hammons, the main medicine she needs is birth control pills.\\n\\nI've been taking birth control since I was 16 because of endometriosis, she explains.\\n\\nIf she can't get the pills, Hammons is in a lot of pain every month. A while back, after losing her health plan, Hammons had a particularly hard time getting a prescription. Her out-of-pocket cost for a doctor's visit in Llano would have been $140.\\n\\nI really did not have — literally — have the money to go to the doctor. Period, she says.\\n\\nHammons says she also couldn't afford to pay out of pocket to pick up the pills every month at a pharmacy.\\n\\nThen, about six months ago, she went online and found NURX. The cost-savings, she says, was really amazing and ... saved me a lot.\\n\\nTexas has become a big market for the app. Dr. Brook Randal, an emergency medicine physician in Austin who works as a provider for NURX, says her patients come from different backgrounds and use the app for different reasons.\\n\\nA lot of them are low-income women who may not have a low-cost clinic available to them in the communities where they live, she says. And so we provide an important service for those women.\\n\\nIn 2013, the state passed an abortion bill that led half of all Texas clinics that performed abortions to close — clinics that often also provided birth control and other medical services to low-income women.\\n\\nMany of those women will tell us that they would have had to drive a really long distance in order to get to a clinic where they can get birth control economically, Randal says.\\n\\nAnd their access to birth control got even worse when Texas lawmakers cut funding for the state's family planning program, says Stacey Pogue, a health policy analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. The cuts came at a time when the state's population was growing and more women were seeking services, Pogue notes.\\n\\nThe ability of our safety net system to meet those needs and deliver health care — to actually get health care to women who are looking for contraceptives and well-woman exams — that has certainly been diminished, she says.\\n\\nApps like NURX that give women access to at least some types of contraceptives are definitely helpful, she says. But they aren't a comprehensive solution.\\n\\nSome of the most effective types of birth control — IUDs and implants — aren't available through the apps, Pogue notes, because they require a visit to a health provider. And apps will never substitute for the missing medical clinics — places where, beyond contraception, women could also get life-saving services, such as pap smears, breast exams and cervical cancer screenings.\\n\\nTexas is one of two states (Indiana is the other) where minors can't buy prescription birth control through NURX because of laws restricting minors' access to contraception.\\n\\nLesley McClurg covers mental health and consumer health stories for KQED in San Francisco, Calif.

{"original": "Trump Pushes Ahead With 'Space Force' Despite Hurdles\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 5:32 p.m. ET\\n\\nPresident Trump pushed forward Tuesday with his plan to launch a space force as a new branch of the military. But it would at first be under the umbrella of the Air Force, and it requires approval of Congress — which is far from certain.\\n\\nThis represents at least a temporary shift. Trump had stated that he wanted a space force that is separate but equal from the Air Force.\\n\\nAmerica must be fully equipped to defend our vital interests. Our adversaries are training forces and developing technology to undermine our security in space, Trump said in the Oval Office as he signed a directive calling on the Pentagon to draft legislation.\\n\\nA plan for the Space Force was announced by Trump last June. He wants it to be a sixth branch of the armed forces to ensure American dominance in space.\\n\\nCritics have suggested that it could further complicate military bureaucracy at great financial cost.\\n\\nUnless there is something that causes a massive expansion in the number of military personnel and amount of money we spend on space that would justify a new department, I honestly can't see that, said Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now at the nonprofit Secure World Foundation.\\n\\nThe White House says creating a space force would mitigate threats in space from other nations. Potential adversaries are now advancing their space capabilities and actively developing ways to attack and destroy our use of space in a crisis or conflict, a senior administration official said, as NPR's Scott Horsley reported.\\n\\nChina, followed by Russia, are the main potential U.S. rivals in space, said\\n\\nJohn Logsdon, professor emeritus at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. I think China has developed the capability to attack our forces in order to defend itself, he said. So whether you call that offensive or defensive they have the ability to wage an attack against U.S. space assets.\\n\\nAs envisioned by Trump, the Space Force's chief of staff would be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would be overseen by a civilian Air Force undersecretary for space.\\n\\nIt would be akin to the structure of the Marine Corps, which is a part of the U.S. Department of the Navy but with separate representation on the Joint Chiefs.\\n\\nThe senior administration official said that if the plan is approved by Congress, the Space Force could eventually fully separate from the Air Force, as Horsley reported.\\n\\nThe force would consolidate command of the military's existing satellite systems into a single command. Those include reconnaissance satellites, GPS, missile-warning systems and communications platforms, as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reported last year.\\n\\nTodd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Brumfiel that the Space Force would not actually involve troops in space. There's no space marines; there's no people flying around with jetpacks, Harrison says. In an opinion piece for Breaking Defense, he recently argued that a space force is needed to consolidate authority and responsibility for national security space in a single chain of command.\\n\\nThe Air Force is currently responsible for many of the U.S. space-related activities. Last September, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said in a memo that establishing a space force would cost some $13 billion over a five-year period.\\n\\nThe costs here are additive costs, she told Defense News. They are not just the movement of other capabilities and consolidate them. To stand up a department that's responsible for recruiting and training and planning and programming and budgeting and all of the leadership requirements that a department has, it's a major undertaking. It's a bold idea.\\n\\nIf the legislation passes, it would be the first time Congress approved a new branch of the military since 1947, when it created the Air Force.\\n\\nAs Horsley reported, administration officials on Tuesday did not clarify the cost of a future force. They did say establishing a new headquarters would cost less than $100 million. Other money would come from consolidating existing space functions within the Space Force, Horsley added. The president's budget might also propose additional money to cover the cost of enhanced military space functions.\\n\\nWhile the idea of a space force is a crowd pleaser at Trump's rallies, it has been met with skepticism or even ridicule among other audiences. The Washington Post rounded up cartoons from around the country about the idea.\\n\\nAnd Netflix has announced that Steve Carell is going to star in a new comedy series about the idea. It's a Workplace comedy centered around the people tasked with creating a sixth branch of the armed services... Space Force.\\n\\nNPR's Greg Myre reported this story for broadcast."}

Their team leader answered an ever-ringing phone, giving his superiors updates on an Afghan commando mission in the mountains just north of Afghanistan's Kandahar Airfield.\\n\\nThe Green Berets could see the progress of the mission on a massive screen on the wall — live video sent by an American drone. The Afghan commandos had opened fire on the Taliban, and they had fired back. An American AH-64 Apache attack helicopter sliced down to shred the defenders. Many scattered.\\n\\nThen, the American troops here spotted about two-dozen men — black-and-white figures on their monitors — carrying rifles and machine guns, moving along a dry riverbed, parallel to the Afghan commandos.\\n\\nThe American soldiers discussed how to respond: Was there an armed drone available to release a Hellfire missile? Or an AC-130 Spooky gunship on hand, with its heavy artillery?\\n\\nBut the Taliban answered the question on their own: When the men emerged from the woods, they had no weapons — knowing that meant the Americans could not fire.\\n\\nOnce we lose positive identification of the enemy, it is our policy not to strike, because our No. 1 concern is civilian casualties, said the Special Forces team leader. NPR was permitted to observe the operation under ground rules that included not identifying him by name.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR\\n\\nThe American and Afghan troops wanted to land a more decisive blow against the Taliban, but they said they tried to keep things in perspective.\\n\\nNot every mission is going to have those stats you look for — enemy killed in action, enemy wounded in action, the team leader said. It really is about the overall objective. And so it may seem frustrating, because obviously, at all points, you want to engage the enemy. But as long as the mission is accomplished, it is good for everybody.\\n\\nOn this recent night in Afghanistan, commanders said the mission was accomplished. The Afghan special operations raid, American drone strikes and an Afghan army clearing operation helped push Taliban fighters from a town blocking a key highway. The insurgents had stopped aid shipments from getting through for nearly a month, and with them pushed out of town, the trucks could move again at last.\\n\\nAmerican officials point to the progress the Afghan forces have made in handling these kinds of operations.\\n\\nAfghan special operations Capt. Shoaib — NPR isn't including his last name because of safety concerns — led the mission, and helped plan the raid in a sandbox using Styrofoam blocks for buildings and toothpicks for trees. He and his men practiced here at the Kandahar base to line up and fan out the way they did when they went into action.\\n\\ntoggle caption David Gilkey/NPR\\n\\nThe Afghans are conducting operations on their own, but they still need American air power for the more challenging ones — to take them into the fight, provide the invaluable overhead surveillance and smash their opponents. The Afghans are years away from being able to conduct this kind of operation on their own, if they ever can.\\n\\nAnd the other factors in Afghanistan aren't standing still. The mountainous district of Shah Wali Kot, where Capt. Shoaib and his troops attacked, has long been an open sore. Australian special operators battled the Taliban there six years ago in heavy fighting, but the insurgents have come back.\\n\\nAnd what's worse is that a recent internal Afghan power struggle meant that dozens of police officers abandoned their checkpoints along the highway.\\n\\nWe received information that 120 sentries, [all] at the same time, went to the Taliban, Capt. Shoaib told NPR. They went with their weapons, ammunition, equipment — everything.\\n\\ntoggle caption David Gilkey/NPR\\n\\nThe Taliban's strategy is to control the highways that run from Helmand province in the west — home to Afghanistan's lucrative crop of opium poppy — all the way east to the Taliban's headquarters in Pakistan.

Shoaib's raid helped break the chain, but both he and the Americans expect he'll have to launch many more to keep the Taliban on their heels.\\n\\nWe will go 10 times, he said.

{"original": "Radical Islam Or Radical Islamism? It Depends Whom You Ask\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, claimed allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State during a phone call to 911 early Sunday. And that's reignited a debate over how to label the ideology that apparently inspired the attack.\\n\\nRepublican Donald Trump and many on the right say it's radical Islam. But Democrat Hillary Clinton used a different term: radical Islamism. It's not just a debate over semantics.\\n\\nWhat exactly would using this label accomplish? President Obama asked Tuesday as he spoke about his administration's fight against ISIS. He spoke at length about the language debate. Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction.\\n\\nWhen he hosted a White House summit on combating violent extremism last year, President Obama explained why he wouldn't use the term radical Islamic terrorism to describe groups like the self-proclaimed Islamic State or al-Qaida. Such groups, he said, did not represent Islam, nor were their leaders religious leaders. We are not at war with Islam, Obama said. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.\\n\\nIn refusing to use the term radical Islam, Obama was following a precedent set by his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, who said after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that ours is not a campaign against the Muslim faith. Ours is a campaign against evil.\\n\\nSoner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy agrees the term radical Islamic is an incorrect way to refer to ISIS. It is not an Islamic group. It does not represent Muslims, so I think it's wrong to call it 'radical Islamic.' It's a 'radical Islamist' group.\\n\\nCagaptay says it is not a matter of mincing words.\\n\\nWhen you say Islamic, you are talking about an adjective of Muslims, and when you say Islamism you are talking about an ideology, a dystopian ideology that tries to recruit from among Muslims.\\n\\nWhen you say Islamic, you are talking about an adjective of Muslims, and when you say Islamism you are talking about an ideology, a dystopian ideology that tries to recruit from among Muslims, Cagaptay says. Obviously, these two things are extremely different.\\n\\nCagaptay points out that the vast majority of Muslims reject ISIS and have themselves been its victims.\\n\\nBut many, including Trump, say it's political correctness that keeps Obama and Democrats from using the phrase. During a speech in New Hampshire on Monday, Trump criticized Clinton, saying that she has for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words 'radical Islam.' \\n\\nClinton still hasn't used that phrase, and has said it makes it sound like the U.S. is declaring war against a religion. Clinton told NPR Monday that whether you call it 'radical jihadism' or 'radical Islamism,' I think they mean the same thing. I'm happy to say either.\\n\\nMark Dubowitz, executive director of the right-leaning Foundation for Defense of Democracies, thinks Clinton is correct to refer to Islamism, but disagrees with Obama, and says words do matter.\\n\\nThe president is right that it's a perversion of Islam, Dubowitz said, but the president is wrong in not describing the nature of the ideology and the theology that is being used to mobilize and motivate these adherents to carry out these terrorist atrocities.\\n\\nAnd whether Trump is being boldly politically incorrect by referring to radical Islam or Clinton and Obama are right that the term only legitimizes terrorists' claims that their actions are based on the Islamic faith, both sides see the language they use as a way of framing the political debate in their favor."}
{"original": "'Late Show' Host Says He Has Finally Found His Post-'Colbert Report' Voice\\n\\nThe comic initially avoided joking about politics on The Late Show for fear that he would fall into his Colbert Report persona. Originally broadcast Nov. 2, 2016.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're continuing our series featuring some of our favorite interviews of the year with Stephen Colbert. Last year, he took over CBS's The Late Show after David Letterman retired. When I spoke with Colbert last month, we talked about why he ended The Colbert Report two years ago and decided it was time to drop his persona as a conservative blowhard. We also discussed what it's been like to create his version of The Late Show and discover who he is on stage out of persona and do political comedy out of persona.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: Stephen Colbert, welcome back to FRESH AIR. And congratulations on your new show - not so new. But it's the first time I've spoken to you (laughter) since you've been...\\n\\nSTEPHEN COLBERT: Cool.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Doing Late Night.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Thanks for having me back. I'm really happy to talk to you.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I'm thrilled. So for The Colbert Report, you had to follow Fox News really closely 'cause your character was based in part on Bill O'Reilly, and...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Though, I didn't actually watch Bill for most of the series. I got it in my head.\\n\\nGROSS: Right.\\n\\nCOLBERT: And then I only watched him on basic stories. I - at a certain point, I couldn't actually sip that cup anymore.\\n\\nGROSS: But you still had to watch Fox in general, didn't you?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah, yeah. We raked through it to see what the take on the right was, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: Right. So I'm thinking you might be taking a special interest in the Roger Ailes sex scandal that led to his having to leave Fox News.\\n\\nCOLBERT: If by special interest, you mean rolling my eyes back in ecstasy in an overstuffed chair...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: If that's what you mean by special interest, then yeah. I have a special interest in that.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: What I can't believe is that happened during the end of the first week - that happened the end of the first week of the Republican convention, when we had already talked to Jon Stewart about coming on as being a surprise guest that night. And I couldn't believe I got to share that moment with Jon at my desk of Roger Ailes's comeuppance or come-down-ance (ph) or however you want to describe that. It was a perfect consummation devoutly to be wished that the two of us should be together as his flaming meteor, you know, hit the surface of the barren planet that will be the rest of his career.\\n\\nGROSS: So now that you're not doing The Colbert Report character, are you watching any more or less of Fox News?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I almost never - I never watch Fox News, nor do I ever mention them on air. You'll notice that I have not said the words Fox News. I think I maybe said it once in 250 shows.\\n\\nGROSS: So why is that?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I don't care. I am not a media critic. I engaged in media criticism with the old show. But I'm a comedian. And, really, the reason to watch Fox News is to do media criticism. And I actually think that there is a - I'm interested in talking about a broader scope of things than getting sucked into the whirlpool of what particular emotional gratification is being expressed on Fox News or MSNBC. The pure polarization that is a hit of heroin to those who take pleasure from political strife has no more appeal to me. I'd rather talk about the story itself and what is happening than what people are saying about the story.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. So I want to play another clip from The Late Show. This is from October 28. And this was after Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich had the big dust-up on her show 'cause he accused her of being fascinated with sex and not caring about public policy after she had asked about allegations of Donald Trump's sexual predatory behavior. And she responded by saying that she's fascinated by the protection of women. So, again, this is about him accusing her of not caring about public policy. And here's what you had to say.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Well, the thing is Megyn Kelly File isn't talking about fun-time, bedroom whoopie-making. She's talking about assault. Oh, wait, unless Newt doesn't know the difference. Maybe no one gave him the talk. Hold on. Let's do this.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Newt, sweetheart...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: ...You're growing up so fast.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: In fact, you're 73.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Your body's changing. You've...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: ...Probably noticed some strange new hair growing on your earlobes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: It's perfectly natural. You're old enough to finally learn about the birds and the bees and the consent.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: You see, when a man has special feelings for a woman, he wants to give her a special hug. He asks her a special question - you up?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: But grabbing a lady because you're a TV star is not sex. It's assault. And fun fact - assault is a matter of public policy 'cause it's illegal even if you use Tic Tacs.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: I hope that clears things up, buddy. I would explain to you what sex is, but then I'd have to picture you doing it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSS: That's Stephen Colbert. That's really, like, hilarious. Can you take us a little bit through the process of coming up with that sketch?\\n\\nCOLBERT: In the morning pitch meeting, someone said, did you hear what Newt did last night? And I said, no, what was it? And they told me the - they told me what he did. And I went, oh, my gosh, what an interesting emotional moment for him and for her. You saw Megyn Kelly in the video. You see Megyn Kelly sort of really throw up her armor and go, all right, well, this is how you're going to behave. It turned from what could've been an interview with ease to one where she was deeply armored and shot a barb at him about - I'll let you deal with your - I'll let you go so you can deal with your anger issues. And it became an emotional moment rather than an informational moment.\\n\\nAnd I really - that was very interesting to me. And we want, more than anything else, then to talk about everything that just happened as quickly as we can, to leave no meat on the chicken for the next day, which is different than the way we used to do our show because it used to be that I was always skiing in Jon Stewart's wake. And I knew that he was going to pick the chicken, as we would say, or eat every berry on the bush of that day's news.\\n\\nAnd we had a hunter-gatherer relationship. Jon would do all the gathering, which is every nut, every berry that's growing that day. And we would do the hunting. We would talk about a single subject maybe for a week. Or we would think about one idea that we might do three or four days from now or maybe two weeks from now as we developed the idea and how my character might put himself in that news story.\\n\\nNow it's how fast can you talk about everything that happened in the news or in popular culture in the last 24 hours? And it's much faster than we used to work. It's - you know, the joke I've made is that we went from go-kart to NASCAR, with all the, you know, advertising stickers on the side of our car, too.\\n\\nGROSS: Does CBS ever ask you to be even-handed in your comedy? Or is it understood that comedy, particularly satirical comedy, is not about being even-handed?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I have not gotten a shred of editorial guidance from them.\\n\\nGROSS: Which I'm sure you're very happy about.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Absolutely. It was one of the things I was most nervous about going over to a network - that there would be a thumb on the scale. I mean, the only thumb on the scale is, you know, can you not mention that car company? Could you mention this car company because they don't sponsor us? And - but it's much like it was over on cable because if the car company or the phone company or whatever it is is in the news, they're hands-off. It's actually surprisingly little interference.\\n\\nGROSS: Glad to hear that.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah, me too.\\n\\nGROSS: We have to take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Colbert. So we're going to take a short break. We will be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Stephen Colbert. He ended his satirical news show, The Colbert Report, in December of 2014 and dropped his persona as a conservative blowhard. In September of 2015, he started hosting The Late Show on CBS.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nCOLBERT: (Laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: So, Stephen, what made you realize it was time to end The Report?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I didn't really want to model the behavior of punditry anymore because I thought it was, A, limiting on a certain level - that I wanted to be able to do more than that character. And I also didn't - I guess the word would be I didn't respect my model anymore. And I...\\n\\nGROSS: Wait, wait. What do you mean by that?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Well, you know, people always said it was Bill. But it's punditry in general, the sense of certainty regardless of the facts that was embodied in the idea of truthiness. That was the thesis statement for the entire show - that how you feel is more important than what the facts are and that the truth that you feel is correct is more important than anything that the facts could support, which is - which we expressed in a very concise way on the show. We embodied it satirically. Though, it's not really a new idea. And as you can see, it's been amplified in interesting ways since we went off the air. But I didn't just want to play the game anymore.\\n\\nThat was - that was a single thesis statement we tried to remind ourselves of every day. I would - when in doubt, I would just sort of recite those mantras to myself about - what is truthiness? And I'm looking out for you. And because I'm looking out for you, I'm also looking over your shoulder because I've got your back. And I have a special relationship with the audience that is - and it's only us. We're the only ones who get it. And if you agree with me, I love you. And please love you because I agree with you.\\n\\nAnd all those emotional ideas - I'd have to remind myself every day to stay in character. And I'd remind myself of them right before I went on stage every night because I thought, well, you've come this far, why blow it now?\\n\\nAnd toward the end of the show, I started to think that my love of that game was diminishing to the point that I might actually blow the entire - I might actually drop the entire China set one day because I just couldn't take playing that character anymore.\\n\\nGROSS: Like accidentally drop it?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah, I guess so. You know, I began to feel like I was stumbling downhill with an armful of bottles and that I couldn't actually keep up the discipline 'cause it took discipline to remind myself every day to - no, be the character. Don't be yourself. And I began to wonder, well, what would it be like to be me?\\n\\nAnd so I decided a couple years before the show ended that I was going to end the show - about two years. I said, OK, this will be the last round of shows that I'll do. And I remember looking at the - before anybody knew, I remember looking at the calendar and saying, what's our last day in 2014? They'd go, oh, it's the 18. It's Thursday the 18. I said, OK, great. And I circled it on the calendar. And I knew - OK, that's the last day I'm doing it - last time I'm doing this show.\\n\\nAnd I - and it was not because I didn't like it anymore. I still liked it, but I just felt like, I'm not sure if I can actually keep this up without hurting someone.\\n\\nGROSS: Hurting someone?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: What do you mean?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I don't know. It's a feeling. I thought maybe I would make some big mistake with the character because he says - he would say terrible things. And I got away with some of the terrible things he would say or do because it was all filtered through his mask. But if I didn't maintain the mask, it would just be me being terrible. And that's - and he would say hateful things or hurtful things.\\n\\nAnd I thought, well, if I don't play this tightly, if I don't hit the bell just right all the time - not that it was a perfect performance. But what I mean is if I didn't maintain this discipline - and I felt my discipline slipping - if I didn't maintain that discipline that I would simply slide into being like the thing that I was mocking.\\n\\nGROSS: At what point did you know that you would be hosting The Late Show? Like, you'd made the decision to stop The Colbert Report before you knew, right?\\n\\nCOLBERT: It fell out of the sky. It was absolutely no part of my plans when I decided to end The Colbert Report. That happened literally years later. It was a complete surprise to me. It hadn't been an ambition of mine. And I'd just been an enormous fan of Dave. And so I had great respect for what he had built. But it - when they called and said, OK, how about you, I was shocked.\\n\\nGROSS: So in that period when you knew you were ending The Colbert Report, and you didn't know what you were going to do next...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: ...What were you thinking about your future?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Oh, I don't know. Go be an actor, I guess.\\n\\nGROSS: Oh, yeah?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah 'cause I'm an actor. And that's how I started. And that's what I was doing for 10 years. I was acting.\\n\\nGROSS: Right. Right. But - so when you were offered Late Night, did you think, but I really wanted to act? I don't know if I want to be doing this.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Well, yeah. I mean, you have to give that some thought. But I also knew that if someone wants to hire me or if I can get my own production company together or create my own project, you can act any time you want. You'll - this opportunity will never come again. And I love a live audience. And I love the grind of every day. And I love the people I work with. And it gave me all the things that I loved.\\n\\nAnd that was not a hard decision once I looked at - that I could leave the thing that I didn't want to do anymore and still keep all the aspects of it that gave me deep satisfaction every day. I mean, this - the release, the privilege it is to do a show about what just happened in the last 24 hours or the last hour or the last half hour, given the speed of the news cycle right now, in front of a live studio audience, which just feels so happy to be there, with people that you love working with who are all pulling on the same rope is a drug.\\n\\nAnd as hard as it is, I get that great release at the end of the day to being in front of the audience. And to know that I can continue that with my friends was the greatest draw. And I also couldn't think of anything after The Colbert Report that would seem like a promotion other than taking over for Dave. And so I said, what a fool I would be to - not to accept this incredible opportunity because I can act until the day I die if I want to. But I can only do this now.\\n\\nGROSS: When you started doing The Late Show as opposed to The Colbert Report, and you were able to drop the Colbert Report persona, did you know what your authentic voice was going to be? - you know, what your voice as, like, the actual Stephen Colbert was going to be? Because you still have to have, like, a bit of a persona as an entertainer onstage.\\n\\nCOLBERT: I don't think so. I knew that it would be a little bit of a public discovery. You know, what's the - it's somebody else's joke, but life is like learning to play the violin in public. You don't know what you're doing until you do it. And I knew that there'd be a learning curve that had to happen in public, on air. I would say that what I didn't anticipate was how much I would overcorrect for not doing the character.\\n\\nGROSS: What do you mean?\\n\\nCOLBERT: I think - well, because I was not talking about politics. I wasn't doing a monologue on the day's events when we first started. I mean, I would still talk about what was happening, but it wasn't highly focused. It wasn't - it did not have intention. And I wasn't speaking all that honestly because I was attempting to do something different than I had done before. And the overcorrect, I would say, is that not realizing that through the character, I was actually speaking very honestly, and you were hearing my voice a lot of the time. You know, there's a...\\n\\nGROSS: I felt that way as a viewer.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. There's a confessional aspect to wearing a mask - you know, the same reason why it's easier to confess behind a screen to a priest than face-to-face. And so by - the character was a 10-year confession, perhaps of, you know, indulging ego and appetite through the person of this character. Then you go on stage as yourself, and you're responsible for everything you say.\\n\\nAnd there's a natural - I think there's a natural inclination to pull your punch because you have to be responsible for what you're saying. You cannot hide behind the mask. And also - that if you talk about politics all the time - well, isn't that what that other guy did? Why would I - or we talk about the news all the time. Well, isn't that what - then how am I changing in any way?\\n\\nAnd it took me - oh, gosh, I would say it took me almost half a year to realize that those two aren't mutually exclusive, that you can have a highly opinionated, highly topical show as yourself and not essentially fall back into the basket of The Colbert Report.\\n\\nAnd now I have no qualms about being sharp and satirical and highly opinionated and saying whatever's on my mind as quickly as I can and not worrying about that - I'm playing the same game. I know I'm not playing the same game. But it took me a little while to realize that the character was not in danger of re-emerging.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah, I was really glad when you added more political satire at the top of the show.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah, me too. It's much more enjoyable, and the audience enjoys it. And it's more honest, actually, because it's what I consume all day.\\n\\nGROSS: We're listening back to the interview I recorded last month with Stephen Colbert, the host of The Late Show on CBS. After we take a short break, he'll talk more about figuring out who he was on stage after dropping his persona from The Colbert Report. And, as we end the year that marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, our classical music critic, Lloyd Schwartz, will review a CD that celebrates Shakespeare in words and music. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded last month with Stephen Colbert. He ended his late-night, satirical news show, The Colbert Report, in December 2014. In September 2015, he started hosting The Late Show on CBS.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: So I want to play another clip from your show. And this was pretty recently. This was from October 25. And as background, a few weeks after you started hosting The Late Show, you interviewed Joe Biden. And on your show, you asked him if he was going to run. And he explained that he wasn't going to run for president because, when you run, you have to give it 110 percent. And with his son Beau having recently died, he just didn't have it in him to give that. So that's background for this clip. This clip is about finding out that you were mentioned in WikiLeaks. So here we go.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Today, we at The Late Show found out we're a WikiLeak.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yep. Yeah, I'm happy about it, too.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: As you know, WikiLeaks has been releasing emails from the Clinton campaign because they're committed to transparency or however you say transparency in Russian.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: (Imitating Russian accent) Transpareshnik (ph). Transpareshnik.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Well, Julian Assange just pinched out another Wiki dump.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: And it included a Clinton campaign email from last year when I had Vice President Joe Biden on my show. Team Clinton was very suspicious that Biden was going to make a major announcement. One Clinton staffer wrote, my prediction - Biden announces his run on Stephen Colbert's show. I don't think he'd take him unless he was making news. Yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: You got me there. You got me there. Why would I talk to the vice president of the United States unless he was making news?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Otherwise, you're just stuck in a boring conversation with Joe Biden.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGROSS: That's Stephen Colbert from October 25 on The Late Show.\\n\\nSo when I heard that - and I thought it was really funny - I was thinking that if this had happened during The Colbert Report, your character would have just loved it because the whole world is about him. Like, everything that happens in the world has to be about him. That's the way he interprets it. So, like, hey, even WikiLeaks is about him. How great is that? But doing this as yourself, you had to have a different take on it.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I like when the news is about me.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: I mean, that's part of what the confession of the character was.\\n\\nGROSS: Right.\\n\\nCOLBERT: I mean, that's - I was able to piggyback my ego on that old guy and pretend it wasn't me.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: You know, but I was waiting - I've been waiting, like, sure, we're going to show up in the WikiLeaks - right? - because we'd had on, you know, Mrs. Clinton, I think, twice already. We'd had Joe Biden on. We had the first lady on. We'd, you know - I mean, we had Tim Kaine on, on some very small level, I know, John Podesta. And I'm like, I've got to show up in these.\\n\\nAnd, yeah, the old show - he would've just been demanding to be in WikiLeaks. He wouldn't have waited until he was in it. He would have said, come on, some - these can't be real. They can't be a real leak, or else I'd be all through them. I'm a huge player here. Something - something doesn't smell right. And - but when this came up, I actually said, like, let's keep our eyes open for if we appear in this because I think, at some point, we're going to pop up.\\n\\nAnd I was absolutely thrilled.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: I just don't demand it of the news, but I'm still just as happy. You know, I like feeling important. I showed up in - Russian hackers found my name and gave it to Julian Assange, and then it became news. What could be better than that?\\n\\nGROSS: So you're doing comedy now not behind the anchor desk, though sometimes you're doing a monologue behind the anchor desk. But you're often doing it...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yes, I sit down there. If it requires graphics and if it requires a sustained argument, I do it behind the desk.\\n\\nGROSS: But, sometimes, you're doing it standing up. And...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. Most of the time.\\n\\nGROSS: So what have you had to learn in terms of, like, you know, walking out and standing in front of the microphone, figuring out what to do with your hands (laughter)?\\n\\nCOLBERT: That was easy. That part was really fast. But to enjoy taking my time with it - that's the thing. And seeing the smiles and the people in the front row unlocked the door for me and allowed me to really enjoy it. You've got to sincerely enjoy what you're doing, or else the audience, I think, can sniff it. And it took me a few months to really enjoy standing there.\\n\\nAnd, as you can see, when the show first started, we did like three-minute opening monologues. Now we do 10-minute opening monologues because I don't want it to end. I want to stay there on stage with them.\\n\\nGROSS: It seems to me one of the hard parts of doing an opening monologue is what to do when the audience is laughing.\\n\\nCOLBERT: What to do when the audience is laughing?\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah, like...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Oh, my gosh...\\n\\nGROSS: ...Do you say something? Do you repeat the punch line? Do you just keep your hands in your pockets? Do you...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Hide your erection.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. What do you do? What do I do while the audience is laughing? That is the hardest part of the job.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: What will I do while the audience is laughing? It's such a challenge. You know, how was the show last night? It was so hard. Why? The audience laughed so much, I didn't know what to do with myself. Oh.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) No, but really, you've got to do something...\\n\\nCOLBERT: What do you do?\\n\\nGROSS: You do have to do something.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Levitate. Nail your feet to the floor because you'll just fly up into the rafters.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: What does he do? You lean into it like it's a wind. It's the greatest feeling in the world. What do you do? That's the easiest part of the job. You smile, and you're happy that they're happy. That's it. And then you're like - you know what the biggest challenge is?\\n\\nGROSS: What?\\n\\nCOLBERT: It's where do you jump back in to get to the next joke?\\n\\nGROSS: Right, OK.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Where do you - how do you ride that energy to the next joke? How then can I use what was given me to give them a better rhythm, a better joke the next time around? How can I slide down the front face of their wave to give them better energy back?\\n\\nIt's like, how can I make this a reciprocal relationship? How can I make this good - this moment feel as good for them as it's feeling for me right now? What can I give back to them? And because comedy is about rhythm, it's, like, where you jump in on their laughter is really maybe the only decision you're making. And if you're really feeling it, it's not a decision at all. So there's nothing to worry about while the audience's is laughing. That's just...\\n\\nGROSS: So you have to wait for the right amount of decay of laughter before you come back in?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Exactly. And if this wasn't radio, I would graph it for you.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) You probably would (laughter). So you used to come in and make the nightly stage entrance doing a kick dance with your band leader Jon Batiste. It was very manic.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: And you've taken...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: ...That down a notch. And you're not doing the kick dance anymore.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Nope.\\n\\nGROSS: Can you talk about changing that?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. When the show first started, I thought, well, it's a giant space. It's a Broadway stage. What kind of energy - what level of energy do I need to fill this space that is then sort of captured by the camera? And - because I used to very much do a show that was for the camera that the audience got to witness. I feel like now I'm doing a show for the room that the cameras witness. And that's...\\n\\nGROSS: That's a really big difference.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Yeah. And you really feel it when you're doing it. And I - my first choice was, well, err on the side of energy. And then at a certain point I realized, well, that actually doesn't translate over the camera. And the audience is just - I'm - and the audience is just as energetic whether I do that or not. And so I started eliminating things. And I said, what's left? What's left is you walking on the stage and doing jokes. And then - and so it was just erring on the side of giving the audience more, giving more energy, knowing I had enough energy for that room 'cause it's a Broadway stage. It's a big house.\\n\\nAnd it's even bigger than when Dave was there because the room had been choked down, I think, a long time, maybe even in Ed Sullivan's days. They had choked the whole room down with huge sound sails and baffles. And you couldn't even tell you were in a theater. It was all so choked down. We've opened it up. It's a restored 1927 theater now. And it's an amazing space to be in. And you feel a great need to fill it.\\n\\nBut what you learn eventually - and this is something I knew sort of intellectually but I'd forgotten instinctually - is that you actually don't need high energy to fill a large space. You need your own sense of presence and focus. You know, you can bend an entire room by bending a paperclip if you've got the focus of the room. And to accept that the audience - you know, that you are their focus, you don't need to do high kicks. You just need to be there, present for them. And then you've filled the entire room.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Stephen Colbert, the host of The Late Show on CBS. We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Stephen Colbert. When he ended his satirical news show, The Colbert Report, he dropped his persona as a conservative blowhard. He's hosted The Late Show on CBS since September 2015, taking over David Letterman's spot.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: Is it a relief for you to be doing interviews as yourself as opposed to in character, trying to - having to try to figure out what your character's take on that person would be?\\n\\nCOLBERT: They're very different. It's not a relief. I enjoy knowing something about their subject. I'll tell you that. You know, I can have Neil Tyson on and know something about...\\n\\nGROSS: Right, because your character was always ignorant.\\n\\nCOLBERT: ...Interplanetary exploration.\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah.\\n\\nCOLBERT: No, my character was a straw man for whatever - for whoever was on. I was a mass of ignorances - and for you to knock down, should you choose to. I used to be alarmed that people would not knock them down. Like, someone would come on and they would call into question the ascendancy of whatever particular figure of their religious right. And I would say, well, you know, all the founding fathers were fundamentalist Christians. And then they wouldn't correct me. And I'd go, oh, good Lord.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: What's going to happen now? Now I've miseducated America again. I won. I don't want to win.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: You know, I didn't always want to win. But my character always wanted to win. The biggest difference is that I'm not there to win against my guest. And, you know, I am not - I'm letting them talk for more than seven seconds at a time. Where I was - I was living by the old Joe Scarborough rule on the old show, which is if your guest talks for more than seven seconds at a time, you've lost control of your show. And I don't do that anymore. I'm so happy to hear the stories that they have to tell.\\n\\nNow, the danger there when I first started the show is that then you bring - you have to bring some opinion to the table, you know? Again, it was like a matter of overcorrection when the show first started. I guess I'll have no punch because everybody was so afraid of - so many people wouldn't come on the old show because the legend of that character, that he was going to stick a knife in your ribs and then slap the handle for the audience's amusement, was not really true. And so I overcorrected when we first started, going, like, I'm not going to have any opinion. I'm just going to let them talk. Or I'm just going to - I'm going to pull every punch.\\n\\nAnd there's a great release. There's a great gift of exhaustion that comes on you from doing a show like this over and over and over again that you actually lose all those second thoughts. And then you're allowed to sort of be yourself with your guests, finally. And again, about six months into the show, I went, OK. I don't have any - I don't have any energy left to overthink this. I just have to do what instinctually feels good to me. And every aspect of the show got better and got easier and became more like me because I didn't have time to think about - I didn't have the energy to think about it anymore.\\n\\nI'll tell you who actually gave me kind of a hint about that - is that - one of my dear friends is Steve Higgins, who's Fallon's announcer and sort of sidekick. And I've known him for many years, and he's a lovely guy. And he said, so how's the schedule going? I said, oh, we're going to start doing two on Thursdays. And he goes, oh, thank God. You're going to love it. I said, why? It's going to kill me, right? And he goes, no. That second show you do on Thursday is how you should do the show every week because you'll be too tired to worry about whether you're making the right choice. And he's absolutely right.\\n\\nGROSS: I want to ask you a question about Pope Francis.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Frankie.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: Papa Francs, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: So what are your impressions of him so far? And what impact does that have on you, as a Catholic, to have a new pope or specifically to have Pope Francis? It's not like you're - you know, you're meeting him or talking with him. But he is the head of the church.\\n\\nCOLBERT: I'm a Catholic unironically. What I like about Pope Francis is that is - the message, for the most part - much is made of his very inclusive message. And there are aspects to his papacy that I'm sure are conservative in ways that his surprised American flock don't pay much attention to. But this is the church that I imagined as a child. And this is the church that I was raised in.\\n\\nThe highly politicized Catholic Church of John Paul the II - how it was brought into the fold of the Republican coalition of the Reagan years always upset me because I think the church is larger than any political moment. And I've always enjoyed its century-long view of things.\\n\\nI like that Francis has put the focus on the poor and humility of saying, who am I to judge the love of a gay couple? Those two things alone are very hopeful that the church has a message that will resonate with the coming generations as the world slowly changes its opinion of certain social stories.\\n\\nGROSS: So one more question - I have taken up a lot of your...\\n\\nCOLBERT: Whatever you want.\\n\\nGROSS: ...Time this morning.\\n\\nCOLBERT: Whatever you want. No, I really - (laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: No, no, that's part of my question. That's part of my question.\\n\\nCOLBERT: OK, yeah.\\n\\nGROSS: We're recording this in the morning. You have a lot of work to do before your show airs. So...\\n\\nCOLBERT: It's 11:21 recording time...\\n\\nGROSS: Yes.\\n\\nCOLBERT: ...Where I am.\\n\\nGROSS: So what do you have to do to compensate for the fact that you were generous enough to give us this interview?\\n\\nCOLBERT: Breathe deeply...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: ...And trust my staff. And I am capable of both. And then I'm ready for whatever the fresh wave of stress is because you've got to kind of like the stress, too. I don't know how to attach a positive feeling to stress and pressure, but there is one. There's a bullet-proof feeling that comes over you. And that's - it's really a pleasant one. And you kind of have to like that.\\n\\nBut to do one of these jobs, you've got to kind of learn to love the flaming toboggan ride of it. You've got to like it because everybody else is in the toboggan with you. You're doing it together. That's the joy. Everybody's doing it together.\\n\\nAt the end of it when - hey, we survived. Pretty good show. Let's do it again tomorrow. And that's - that's it. It's the movement forward because it never stops. You've got to love the downhill hurdle. There's no finish line. You've got to just love missing all those trees that you could've hit today.\\n\\nGROSS: Stephen, I absolutely love talking with you. I'm so glad you came back to our show. And I'm so glad you're back on TV (laughter).\\n\\nCOLBERT: It is a pleasure talking to you, Terry, because when I found out I'd be talking to you again, I thought, oh, I'm talking to Terry. Maybe the show means something.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) I love the show. I'm so glad you're doing it.\\n\\nCOLBERT: (Laughter) Thanks.\\n\\nGROSS: Stephen Colbert hosts The Late Show on CBS. Our interview was recorded last month. Our series featuring some of our favorite interviews of the year concludes Monday with comic Jeff Ross, who's famous for his role roasting celebrities on Comedy Central. After we take a short break, we'll mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death with Lloyd Schwartz's review of a recording celebrating Shakespeare in words and music.

{"original": "What To Do When Your Health Insurance Won't Pay The Bills\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tetra Images/Getty Images Tetra Images/Getty Images\\n\\nUnderstanding your health plan benefits and what isn't covered is crucial for consumers. But that isn't always easy. Readers' questions this month center around what insurance companies need to tell customers about their benefits and when. For example, does my insurer have to give advance notice if it changes my benefits? And does my plan have to issue a written excuse if it denies coverage for services? What if the coverage doesn't meet federal health law standards? Here are some answers.\\n\\nQ: My father's health insurance coverage through his company was reduced without him being aware of the change. The insurance company continued to cover my parents' bills until 10 months after the change. Now it's trying to charge my parents for all of my mother's doctor visits to manage her multiple sclerosis during that time. This will result in thousands of dollars in repayments. Can the insurer do that?\\n\\nYou may need to do some digging to figure out what's going on here. Health plans can reduce the benefits that they offer or increase cost sharing during the plan year, but under the ACA, they generally have to notify enrollees 60 days before any changes become effective.\\n\\nThat doesn't always happen, says Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\\n\\nIt is very possible that something was done incorrectly, particularly if you have a self-funded employer that's doing all the claims processing in-house, says Palanker, a former health plan administrator.\\n\\nSince the health plan continued to pay the claims for your mother's multiple sclerosis for 10 months after the change, this may not be a notification problem, however.\\n\\nIt suggests that the insurance company did a claims audit and determined that they should never have been paying these claims, Palanker says. Such audits are common. They do it routinely to try to identify fraud and abuse.\\n\\nSome states don't allow insurers to retroactively adjust claims except in cases of fraud.\\n\\nYour first step should be to contact the health plan to find out why the claims were denied retroactively.\\n\\nYou could also enlist your dad's human resources department to help resolve the problem Or you may need to file an appeal with the health plan, complain to your state insurance regulator, or to the federal Department of Labor.\\n\\nQ: As a longtime self-employed businesswoman, I've bought coverage on the individual market for years. I was unaware that the short-term health insurance policy I'd been sold didn't meet ACA requirements. The pricing was similar. Don't people have to agree in writing that they understand the limitations of those policies? Is there anything I can do?\\n\\nAs of last January, short-term health plan enrollment applications and related materials were required to prominently display a warning that the plan doesn't satisfy the health insurance coverage requirements under the ACA. There's no requirement that people acknowledge in writing that they understand what they're buying, however. Since these short-term plans aren't considered adequate coverage, you may have to pay a penalty just like people who don't buy any insurance.\\n\\nIn your case, you may have purchased the plan before that requirement went into effect, says Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington and Lee law school.\\n\\nAs for remedies, fortunately the open enrollment period for 2018 starts Nov. 1. You can sign up for a more comprehensive plan at that time on your state marketplace for coverage that begins Jan. 1.\\n\\nQ: I was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury, had surgery, and spent two months in the intensive care unit. Now my insurer is no longer covering some of my medical care. Does my insurer have to notify me of this change, or is it sufficient that the hospital insurance case manager verbally informed me?\\n\\nHealth plans have to notify you in writing when they deny a claim. But in your case, there may not have been an actual denial, Palanker says.\\n\\nHospital staff are typically in constant communication with a patient's insurer about what services are covered, whether a particular treatment requires prior authorization from the health plan, or similar issues.\\n\\nIt's not uncommon for a doctor to want a patient to remain in the hospital, for example, while the insurer maintains that it's not medically necessary, Palanker says. The insurer may want the patient moved to an inpatient rehabilitation center or be discharged home instead.\\n\\nIn these cases, there's not an actual adverse determination and thus no requirement that the insurer notify you. The hospital case manager would likely be the one to inform you of the change.\\n\\nYou still have a right to that information. Talk to the case manager about their discussions with the insurer, says Palanker. The hospital's patient advocate or caseworker can help put together the necessary paperwork to request a determination and file an appeal with the insurer, if necessary.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

{"original": "FACT CHECK: Donald Trump Unveils His Economic Plan In Major Detroit Speech\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nEditor's note: NPR will also be fact-checking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's planned economic speech this Thursday.\\n\\nDonald Trump is coming off a week of disastrous headlines and cratering poll numbers. His major economic speech on Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, a vision described by his campaign as Winning the Global Competition, was a chance to turn the page.\\n\\nListen to Trump's Economic Speech 52:36\\n\\nDuring an address of just over an hour — which was interrupted multiple times by protesters — the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a new iteration of his proposal to reshape America's tax system. It has just three tax brackets (one fewer than the tax plan he released in September, which was removed from his website in the past 24 hours), would limit taxes on all forms of business income to 15 percent, would end the estate tax and would exclude childcare expenses from taxation.\\n\\nOther highlights include a proposed moratorium on all new federal regulations and would remove bureaucrats who only know how to kill jobs [and] replace them with experts who know how to create jobs, according to a preview released by his campaign. It's unclear exactly what that means or how it would work, but there are currently about 2.7 million civilian federal employees.\\n\\nAs for trade, which has been a centerpiece of his economic agenda, Trump reiterated calls for the U.S. to pull out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and for NAFTA to be renegotiated. He said would appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America, and he would apply tariffs on countries that cheat. Economists have raised concerns in the past that such tariffs could lead to a trade war that would ultimately hurt American interests.\\n\\nSpeaking at a rally later Monday afternoon in Florida, Hillary Clinton didn't pass up the opportunity to criticize Trump's economic speech. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while Trump's could cost the country more than 3 million. She also accused Trump of scrambling to do damage control by listing a new group of economic advisers.\\n\\nHe's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named: Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently. And so they wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. Now, they tried to make his old tired ideas sound new. But here's what we all know, because we heard it again. His tax plans will give super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech, right, said Clinton. He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.\\n\\nBelow is Trump's speech in its entirety, with annotations and fact-checks from NPR's team of political and economic reporters.\\n\\nDonald Trump, Detroit Economic Club\\n\\nThank you everybody, thank you very much. Thank you. Such a crowd - beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please.\\n\\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit. I've been here many times. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to make America great again - for everyone, especially and I say especially, for those who have the very least.\\n\\nThe city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\\n\\nWhen we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families and lived out, totally, lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\\n\\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities in the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair. Yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15K - about half of the national average.\\n\\n40% of the city's residents live in poverty, over two and a half times the national average.\\n\\n[This is true. The most recent figures show Detroit's poverty rate is 39.3 percent, which is more than the double the national average of 15.5 percent. -Will Huntsberry]\\n\\nThe unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.\\n\\n[This is technically true. Detroit city proper has an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, which is twice the national average of 4.9 percent. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics often figures these numbers by metro area. The Detroit metro area has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent. -Will Huntsberry]\\n\\nHalf of all Detroit residents do not work.\\n\\n[It is true, according to the most recent data, that less than half of Detroiters have a job, but this figure includes small children and retirees. The 'employment-population ratio,' as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that 43.9 percent of Detroiters had a job in 2014, while 59 percent of people in the United States had a job the same year. A more often cited statistic, which removes people younger than 16 from the calculus, is the 'participation rate.' It was 53.4 percent in Detroit and 62.9 percent for the United States. -Will Huntsberry]\\n\\nDetroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime.\\n\\n[Recent FBI data do show that among major cities, Detroit has the highest violent crime rate. However, the FBI also cautions against comparing cities' rates, as many factors, like population density, can affect a city's rate. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nThese are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton. But victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n[Detroit's decline began more than 50 years ago, decades before NAFTA and other trade deals. Hillary Clinton wasn't in elected office or even first lady then. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe. And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future.\\n\\nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. One hundred percent.\\n\\n[Mayor Mike Duggan is a Democrat, and they city's mayors have been Democratic since 1962. But Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is a Republican. — Jessica Taylor]\\n\\nToday, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out (protesters interrupt) ...thank you everybody. This is what happens when you go from thirty five people to close to two thousand people, I guess. — in the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\\n\\nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that.\\n\\nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\\n\\nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Big increase - one of the biggest ever. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.\\n\\nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited - you know this, you've heard this one - Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\\n\\n[Politifact has rated this claim pants on fire, but Trump continues to say it at events, including in this highly scripted speech. Clinton has campaigned extensively on not raising taxes on the middle class. His campaign has circulated a misleading video with a caption saying she said she wants to raise taxes on the middle class, but you can hear she says we aren't going to raise taxes on the middle class - Tamara Keith]\\n\\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete.\\n\\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction, a well-known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.\\n\\n[Many politicians argue that streamlining the U.S. tax code is a good idea. However, cutting the number of brackets doesn't do a whole lot to simplify things. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.\\n\\n[Last September Donald Trump released a tax plan with four tax brackets: 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent. It was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive. The new proposal eliminates the 0 percent bracket, thus making this line from Trump's original tax plan null: If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, I win, those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each. -Tamara Keith] [UPDATE: In an interview with Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump said the zero bracket is in there big league.]\\n\\nFor many American workers, their tax rate will be zero. While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. We will Make America Grow Again.\\n\\nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and most importantly your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\\n\\nSo important - the State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published today a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises.\\n\\n[Here is that article. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nShe pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? What happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging record-setting levels, plunging nearly 25 percent...the former first lady was totally unable to pass big ticket legislation... Many promised jobs they were all promised, I remember it so well...Vote for Hillary - she'll bring back your jobs, many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run which also was a disaster.\\n\\nData shows that upstate actually lost jobs a lot them during Clinton's first term. In other words, she was all talk, no action, upstate New York is a disaster. What's happened to upstate New York. And NAFTA, which her husband signed, is a very, very big reason.\\n\\n[Bill Clinton did sign NAFTA, but it's misleading to attribute that policy entirely to him. In fact, it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush, who signed it in 1992, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out. After Congress passed it, Clinton then signed it into law in 1993. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nCompare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City, the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote in other words, it's not from me (crowd interruption) thank you...it's all very well planned out – and this is a direct quote that basically Donald Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park so dangerous and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out...then almost by sheer force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead.\\n\\nTrue. Have to say. I didn't say it. They said it. It's true. This is what I want to do.... We all remember New York City was a disaster. We made it great. We made it great. This is want I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America. And it can be done. And it won't even be that hard.\\n\\nNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, it's been written about all over, it's a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the Obama years. There are now 94.3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people.\\n\\n[His numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13.8 million, according to the Labor Department). However, this statistic alone is misleading. The number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since January 2009. It's true that the labor force participation rate — the share of Americans in the labor force — is low in recent years. However, as of 2014, the Congressional Budget Office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\\n\\n[Homeownership recently hit a 51-year low, as the Associated Press recently reported. However, the homeownership rate can be deceiving, as Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko wrote in 2014 at the New York Times. For some young adults who live with their parents, renting their own apartments could be a sign of economic progress. But as they go out and create their own households in those rented apartments, that could push down the homeownership rate (measured as a share of all households), even while their situations are improving. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\n(More protesters interrupt) Thank you...I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit, I will say.\\n\\nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp and, these people are growing and growing so rapidly, since President Obama took office.\\n\\n[According to annual totals, more than 12 million more people were receiving SNAP benefits in 2015 than in 2009. However, Trump is wrong that the total is growing and growing so rapidly. The total number of recipients has fallen every month since December 2015, according to the USDA. And by the annual numbers, participation has been falling since 2013. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nAnother nearly 7 million people, great Americans, are right now living in poverty.\\n\\n[The number of Americans in poverty grew by 6.8 million from 2008, the year before Obama took office, through 2014, the latest year of data available. The poverty rate (a better measure here, though it's still very flawed) is up by 1.6 percentage points, to 14.8 percent, though it is down from a high of 15.1 in 2010. Numbers aside, though, it's hard to blame President Obama for all these increases — for example, poverty was already rising when he took office. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\\n\\n[His numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate — the share of people working or looking for work — right now is at 62.8 percent. That rate hit a recent low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. The last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. However, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. As we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i.e., Baby Boomers retiring), so the decline in the rate isn't entirely a bad thing. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\n58 percent of the African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\\n\\n[Trump pointed to this table from the Labor Department, and the data do show that 58.5 percent of African-Americans age 16 to 24 aren't in the labor force or are unemployed. It's true that the unemployment rate is higher among black youth than among whites and Asian-Americans. Still, this figure seems high because many 16-to-24-year-old Americans (of any race) aren't in the labor force (for example, because they're in school). Around 49 percent of African American youth aren't in the labor force, by these data, compared to around 45 percent of all 16-to-24-year-olds. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nOne in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Not a single member of a household. These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.\\n\\n[Earlier in the speech, Trump used Labor Department measures of unemployment for Detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. His son, Donald Jr., has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. PolitiFact gave that claim a pants on fire rating. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Aside from that, it's true that the current unemployment figure — 4.9 percent — is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. In fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the Labor Department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. However, that doesn't make the headline unemployment rate a hoax. As for the 1 in 5 figure, Trump is working off of a BLS report that found that 19.7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. That's different from in the labor force, and it's also an incomplete measure — the Labor Department's definition of family would include retired couples, for example. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 think of that, $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. Very grim picture.\\n\\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and in many states, it's much higher than that. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the United States tax-free if they move overseas. This, ladies and gentlemen, is backwards, it's backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States.\\n\\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35% to 15%.\\n\\n[While the federal corporate tax rate is 35%, the Congressional Research Service found in 2014 that the average effective corporate tax rate was around 27% and the Government Accountability Office calculated in 2010 that profitable businesses were paying federal income taxes amounting to about 13% of their total global income. --Arnie Seipel] [Independent budget analysts have raised concerns that the 15% business rate would cause many people to quit their jobs and become independent contractors to pay lower taxes. This could cut into revenues severely. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nThank you. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won't be able to start — you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. We're going to end it. I am going to cut regulations massively massively.\\n\\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and by the way into cities like right here in Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\\n\\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\\n\\n[Tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy Americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. Lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn't be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. Trump's campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: Mr. Trump's plan would better help struggling families. Current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. The deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. We provide credit to stay-at-home caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. To provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes—increasing their paycheck income each week.  – Trump campaign The campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks. --Tamara Keith]\\n\\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that are now parked overseas they can't bring their money back into our country. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying only a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan, states like Michigan which are having serious problems. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it's just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\\n\\n[The death tax, or estate tax, applies this year to estates with combined assets exceeding $5.45 million. — Peter Overby ] [That applies to very few people — around 1 in 500 estates were subject to the tax last year, according to the Tax Policy Center. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nNext comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want t jobs and I want wealth to stay in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current over-regulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that's money taken straight out of cities like Detroit. So many of our cities are suffering so gravely, right out of Detroit and others. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long.\\n\\nAs the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down, and that's what it's doing - it's dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.\\n\\nMy running mate, Mike Pence, and by the way, a great guy, signed a similar order when he became and when he worked so hard in Indiana as its governor. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring new jobs, and expanding their businesses. So important. That's what it's about. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\\n\\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill many many jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated quickly. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. We don't win anymore. But when I am president, we will start winning again, big league.\\n\\nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\\n\\n[Trump is referring to the $400 million dollars flown to the Iranian government by the Obama administration in January, at the same time American prisoners were released from Iran. The money was part of a settlement of a decades-old legal dispute, involving military sales before the Shah was overthrown in 1979. The State Department said it is completely false to say it was a ransom payment, though it coincided with the release of American prisoners. The payment was made in foreign currencies because it's illegal to conduct a transaction with Iran in U.S. dollars under current law. --Arnie Seipel]\\n\\nBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here for everybody to see in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported job-killing trade deal and that was a really bad one with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not now, but very soon if she wins and we can't let her win. Cause that will be a disaster for Detroit and everybody else.\\n\\nLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. What else is new? It's happening with everyone.\\n\\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have been saying, and this is from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. As sure as you're sitting there. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it's also a vote for NAFTA.\\n\\n[Clinton and Trump alike are in favor of renegotiating NAFTA, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost $60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. She has been a disaster. Obama has been a disaster. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\\n\\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry, believe me, even bigger and even worse than NAFTA. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member, all of the member countries has cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in the year 2015.\\n\\nBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. What are we doing? Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. It will be catastrophic. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen.\\n\\nHillary Clinton will never withdraw from TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. One hundred percent. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, big problem, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA, which is a disaster for our country. A total renegotiation. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.\\n\\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our country. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\\n\\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\\n\\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.\\n\\n[According to a study in Energy Policy, the coal industry lost about 50,000 jobs nationally between 2008 and 2012. Another study by the Energy Information Administration suggests that the rise of cheap natural gas has impacted the coal industry — Jonquilyn Hill]\\n\\nHillary Clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business. We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\\n\\nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years; Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades; Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\n\\nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\\n\\n[In a footnote to the speech, Trump pointed to a December 2015 CBO working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million full-time-equivalent workers than it would be without Obamacare — meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million FTE workers. However, that's not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the U.S. economy: Some people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would, the CBO reported. In other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\\n\\nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country. We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\\n\\nDetroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\\n\\nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\\n\\n[This is a frequent campaign promise from Trump, but his own hiring practices haven't always reflected this view. A recent Buzzfeed article detailed Trump's effort to bring in foreign guest workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort. When asked about this, Trump has said it is hard to get enough American workers for these seasonal jobs. -Tamara Keith]\\n\\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\\n\\nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before. Thank you, and God Bless You."}
{"original": "Sen. Lee And Other Lawmakers Criticize White House Briefing On Iran\\n\\nNPR's Rachel Martin talks to GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah about his support for a resolution to limit the president's war powers over what he called an insulting briefing. NPR's Mara Liasson weighs in.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nThe Trump administration has informed the United Nations that when it killed Iran's General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike, it was acting in self-defense. But many members of Congress haven't seen evidence of that. And according to some lawmakers who were briefed by the White House yesterday, they've been instructed not to ask tough questions about the president's ability to use military force against Iran in the future.\\n\\nOur next guest was in that closed-door briefing and afterwards called it, quote, insulting and demeaning. He is Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, and he joins us now. Senator, thank you so much for talking with us.\\n\\nMIKE LEE: Thank you. It's good to be with you.\\n\\nMARTIN: You came out and came to the microphones and said it was the worst briefing you have seen on a military issue in your nine years in the U.S. Senate. What happened?\\n\\nLEE: Yes. You know, my anger was not about the Soleimani killing. It was, instead, about the possibility of future military action against Iran. And it was on that topic that they refused to make any commitment about when, whether and under what circumstances it would be necessary for the president, or the executive branch of government, to come to Congress seeking authorization for the use of military force.\\n\\nMARTIN: Because Congress was not given a...\\n\\nLEE: I find that unacceptable.\\n\\nMARTIN: Congress was not given a heads-up that the strike was going to happen against Soleimani.\\n\\nLEE: That's right. That's right. And now, I want to be clear - with respect to the strike against Soleimani, that was arguably lawful. I still have questions that remain unanswered on that point. I'm going to set that side - aside a moment. And I'm going to assume, for purposes of this discussion, that that may well have been lawful.\\n\\nWhat I'm most concerned about is about where that goes from here. What comes next? Is there another strike coming against Iran? If so, at what point do they need to come to us seeking an authorization for the use of military force? The fact that they were unable or unwilling to identify any point at which that would be necessary yesterday was deeply distressing to me.\\n\\nMARTIN: What kind of hypotheticals were you putting to them in hopes of understanding when the administration sees a need for congressional authority?\\n\\nLEE: As I recall, one of my colleagues asked a hypothetical involving the supreme leader of Iran. If at that point, the United States government decided that it wanted to undertake a strike against him personally, recognizing that he could be a threat to the United States, would that require authorization for the use of military force? The fact that there was nothing but a refusal to answer that question was perhaps the most deeply upsetting thing to me in that meeting. I think it was unprofessional, inappropriate and reflective of a certain cavalier attitude toward the Constitution to refuse to make a commitment on that front.\\n\\nMARTIN: So the reporting has it that you all, in that briefing, were outrightly discouraged from asking tough questions - that the tone in the room got a little tense when people tried to push. Is that correct?\\n\\nLEE: Well, when people asked tough questions, it's not so much that we were discouraged from asking them in that context as much as it was we weren't getting direct answers. And at one point, at least one of the briefers discouraged us even from having a debate on the Senate floor, including, among other things, in the context of a War Powers Act resolution talking about future military action - that that might somehow embolden the Iranian regime in future attacks against the United States and wouldn't be helpful. I think that is the very kind of advice that is counterproductive and decidedly not helpful. And I found that upsetting.\\n\\nMARTIN: So they were discouraging debate over a potential War Powers Act that would limit the president's ability to deploy military force against Iran. This is something, we should mention, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is bringing a vote on this very kind of resolution today. It is my understanding that you were against limiting the president's power in that respect before you went into this briefing, and you came out and changed your mind.\\n\\nLEE: I wouldn't put it quite like that. I was undecided as to whether I would be supporting the resolution introduced by Senator Kaine - an amended, modified version of that pursuant to amendments that he agreed with me to make yesterday. But...\\n\\nMARTIN: So where do you stand on...\\n\\nLEE: ...Any doubt I had about joining that - oh, I'm going to join it. I'll be supporting it. I'll not only be voting for it, I'll become a co-sponsor of it as soon as those changes are made...\\n\\nMARTIN: I do want to play...\\n\\nLEE: ...To his amendment.\\n\\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt. I do want to play a clip of Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He and other Republicans had a dramatically different take on the outcome of the briefing.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMARCO RUBIO: It was very well done. I think they've done an excellent job of outlining the rationale behind both the decision to go after Soleimani and the response to the Iranian attack yesterday.\\n\\nMARTIN: Now, you have said earlier that you believe in the legal justification of the strike. But how could Marco Rubio come out of that briefing with such a different opinion than you?\\n\\nLEE: I think he must have been in a different briefing than I attended. I literally find it difficult to imagine how my friend Marco, who is smart, who listens carefully, who cares about these things - how he could emerge from that meeting and say that it was good. It was terrible. I think it was an unmitigated disaster.\\n\\nMARTIN: What kind of precedent do you think this sets?\\n\\nLEE: Not a good one. It's a precedent that is, unfortunately, not itself unprecedented. We have had many decades now - going back 50, 60, 70 years - in which we've been drifting away from this idea embedded within the Constitution that the power to declare war belongs to the Congress. It's enumerated in Article I, Section 8. There's a reason for that. We wanted to make sure that the power to put American blood and treasure on the line is given only to that branch of government most accountable to the people at the most regular intervals. Ours is not a system in which we can be taken into war by the executive, and it never should be.\\n\\nMARTIN: Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah. We appreciate your time. Thank you, sir.\\n\\nLEE: Thank you.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson was listening into that conversation. She joins me now. Mara, what's your response?\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, there.\\n\\nMARTIN: What did you think about that?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, this - I have - there have been a lot of clashes between the president and his own party on foreign policy, even though Republicans are usually in lockstep with him on almost everything else. But I have never seen it reach this level of ferocity, even if it isn't that widespread other than Senator Lee. Senator Paul has also expressed his disappointment in the briefing. I don't know how many more Republicans would come forward.\\n\\nBut this is a pretty big split. And as Senator Lee said, the clash between the branches about war powers have been going on for a long time. Congress has been ceding its constitutional authority to declare war, bit by bit, to the executive. But this is a president who has said that Article II of the Constitution lets him do whatever he wants. And Mike Lee said he has a cavalier attitude towards Congress; others have said it's contemptuous.\\n\\nMARTIN: Is this going to be a problem for the president, who up until now - as you have noted - has enjoyed a kind of unanimity among Republicans on the Hill?\\n\\nLIASSON: I don't think that the War Powers Resolution is going to affect him in the short term. First of all, he seems to be willing to accept the off-ramp that Iran was offering, doesn't want to escalate. And also, this is a resolution. It's not...\\n\\nMARTIN: Right. It's not binding.\\n\\nLIASSON: It doesn't have the force of law, yeah.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson with context for us. Thank you.\\n\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

{"original": "Secretary Of State Nominee Blinken Promises A Reengaged America Abroad\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 4:39 p.m. ET\\n\\nAntony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for secretary of state, vowed to restore American leadership on the world stage and work for the greater good during his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday.\\n\\nHumility and confidence should be the flip sides of America's leadership coin, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. ... But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good.\\n\\nSenators questioned Blinken on how he would deal with Iran and China and how the incoming administration would rebuild frayed alliances.\\n\\nWe are so much better off, even in institutions and organizations that are clearly imperfect and need reform; we're as a general rule much better off being at the table than being outside the room if we're going to try and influence those institutions and organizations and move them in a better direction, Blinken told senators.\\n\\nSo I think you will see in a Biden administration that kind of engagement, that kind of leadership, he said.\\n\\nBlinken said it was important to approach China — which he said poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States — from a position of strength.\\n\\nWe have to start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness, he said, a position of strength when we are working with, not denigrating, our allies ... a position of strength when we are engaged and leading in international institutions, not pulling back and ceding the terrain to China to write the rules and norms that animate those institutions.\\n\\nHe said President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China, though he disagreed with the outgoing president's approach. But the basic principle was the right one.\\n\\nBlinken has the resume of a diplomat. A Harvard University and Columbia Law School graduate who went to high school in Paris and speaks French, he was deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration. He was national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president and was the Democratic staff director on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was its chairman. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he served on the National Security Council.\\n\\nBlinken cofounded WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm, after Trump became president.\\n\\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Blinken's work to help restore America's credibility and rebuild alliances will be harder in the wake of the Capitol Hill insurrection.\\n\\nThe mountain that he was going to have to climb to restore America's credibility was a 14,000-footer. It just became a 15,000-footer, Murphy told the Atlantic Council on Friday. Murphy said he's been reaching out to Republicans on Blinken's behalf to pave the way for quick confirmation.\\n\\nOn its first day in office, the Biden administration plans to rejoin the Paris climate accord, restore America's leading role in the World Health Organization and reverse Trump's executive order banning travel from some predominantly Muslim countries.\\n\\nAaron David Miller of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace calls these issues low-hanging fruit compared with other challenges Blinken will face. Strained relationships with key allies and rising threats from Iran, North Korea, Russia and China were among the issues senators pressed him on during Tuesday's confirmation hearing.\\n\\nYou know, looking out at this world, I divide it into migraine headaches on one hand and root canals on the other, Miller told NPR, citing challenges including the coronavirus pandemic, threats from Iran, and North Korea's expanding nuclear and missile arsenal. It's a world where American power and influence is now challenged routinely by China and Russia, by smaller powers like Iran and North Korea, and where the notion that we are the indispensable power has kind of gone the way of the dodo.\\n\\nIt doesn't mean the U.S. can't lead, but it's going to be a lot harder, said Miller, who has advised six secretaries of state.\\n\\nIt's especially true when it comes to China, said Michael Green, a former George W. Bush administration official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Trump administration is leaving some initiatives that the Biden administration will probably continue, he said. But it is also leaving problems.\\n\\nThe withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership means that the United States is now involved in none of the major economic negotiations in Asia, he said. Trump and his leadership skipped most of the diplomacy in Southeast Asia, and that's where China is starting to expand its influence. ... And Trump put a lot of tariffs and pressure on U.S. allies that really rattled them.\\n\\nBiden, he said, will have to restore confidence among allies and get the U.S. back in the diplomatic game.\\n\\nThe president-elect is bringing in some diplomatic heavyweights to help. He's tapped Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state, to oversee White House Asia policy. Former Secretary of State John Kerry will take a lead in climate diplomacy.\\n\\nThere are some traditional foreign policy experts who think this is a really bad idea to have too many chefs in the kitchen, Green said. But given all the challenges he faces, he doesn't see how Biden can avoid it.\\n\\nIn his confirmation hearing testimony, Blinken described his own American story, saying his grandfather Maurice Blinken found refuge in America after fleeing pogroms in Russia.\\n\\nHis late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, a Holocaust survivor from Poland, escaped a death march and was rescued by Sgt. Bill Ellington, a Black GI.\\n\\nBlinken said in his testimony that Pisar fell to his knees and said the only three words he knew in English that his mother had taught him: God Bless America. The GI lifted him into the tank, into America, into freedom. That's who we are. That's what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be at our best."}
{"original": "McMaster, An Iconoclast, Confronts A Job Bound By Political Realities\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sgt. Paul Sale/U.S. Army Sgt. Paul Sale/U.S. Army\\n\\nLt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has already had his easiest day as President Trump's national security adviser.\\n\\nTrump's announcement of McMaster was met with widespread acclaim by the Washington national defense establishment, including from people who are not particular fans of Trump's.\\n\\nThe array of challenges facing the president and his new top assistant is so vast, however, and the amount of room they have to maneuver so comparatively small, the White House may struggle even if it gets control over its own internal clashes over power and access to the president.\\n\\nThe outside world, at very least, does not appear likely to cooperate.\\n\\nWhat we might call our holiday from history in the post-Cold War period is over, McMaster said last spring in an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\\n\\nHe quoted a historian connecting the events of today's era to those of 1914 — the year the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand exploded into World War I — as really making the point that geopolitics is back.\\n\\nIf global geopolitics is back and history has resumed (after ending for a time after the fall of the Soviet Union, in the construction of Stanford expert Francis Fukuyama), American domestic politics haven't gone anywhere. And that constraint may be the greatest brake on Trump's and McMaster's ability to make major changes in the strategic direction of the United States.\\n\\nThe White House does have some options. Trump's aggressive — if vague — rhetoric about the war against the Islamic State has bought McMaster a political rain shadow, at least at first. Trump vowed to knock the hell out of 'em and step up operations in Iraq and Syria, without giving detail. He also has abandoned former President Barack Obama's onetime pretense that American forces weren't in combat, even after the deaths of troops in Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nSo as McMaster, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other leaders plot the aggressive new approach for ISIS that Trump wants, they have room to run that their predecessors did not. That could mean more weapons, more special operations troops closer to the fight against ISIS, reduced safeguards for civilians or other revisions to the current rules of engagement.\\n\\nPentagon officials have also signaled they might consider recommending new deployments of combat forces to Iraq or Syria as part of the review Trump requested. But Americans have almost no appetite for a new large-scale foreign adventure as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to smolder.\\n\\nIn 2013, Obama stepped right up to the brink of ordering a major U.S. military attack against Syria — then stopped. Obama had the power as commander in chief to order American forces into action, he decided, but he wanted Congress to authorize it. Lawmakers considered his request for about as long as it took to sweep it under the Capitol rug.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\\n\\nUnless Trump makes a case to Congress and voters that changes those attitudes, he and McMaster could remain locked into a version of Obama's approach to the war — providing air power and other support to local forces in Iraq and Syria.\\n\\n(The irony of McMaster picking up Obama's strategy is that it embraces at least three of what McMaster has called the Pentagon's four latter-day fallacies of war: an overreliance on precision airstrikes supported by high-tech surveillance; an overemphasis on special operations forces; and a preference for the use of indigenous troops over Americans.)\\n\\nAs for another of Trump's desires — closer collaboration with Russia against ISIS in Syria — that door may already have closed. Mattis said flatly in Belgium he thought nothing beyond a political accommodation was practically possible for now. And McMaster — who began his career deployed to West Germany, buttoned up in a tank prepared to fight the Soviet 8th Guards Army — is not known as particularly sympathetic to Moscow.\\n\\nHe has, however, acknowledged the political bounds of what Americans will countenance. McMaster was asked at his CSIS talk whether there was any Pentagon hardware or system that could offset the limited troop commitments that voters might tolerate: No, he said. There's no technology that can do it.\\n\\nGlobal politics are another factor. Vice President Pence, Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all took turns reassuring America's European allies last week at the Munich security summit in Germany — but there are many signs it didn't sink in.\\n\\nThe European leaders heard the soothing words of the administration leaders. But they can't forget the campaign bluster of Trump, who amplified a long-standing bit of U.S. foreign policy boilerplate — NATO nations must make good on their defense spending commitments — into what sounded like a full-scale assault on the alliance itself.\\n\\nMcMaster is a huge advocate for American relationships, especially in the context of the European frontier with Russia.\\n\\nAllies are pretty darn important, right? he said at the CSIS event last May. Especially at these far reaches of American power. Especially when hoping to deter these revisionist powers. And so really what we want to do is prevent conflict, and our allies are essential to doing that.\\n\\nMcMaster and Trump may be able to square their views inside the Situation Room, but the problem, as NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reported, is that at worst, the Europeans are already terrified. At best, they are confused.\\n\\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel did not take a direct shot at Trump, but she and others asked rhetorically which worldview from Washington they should believe.\\n\\nWill we be able to continue working well together, as Merkel asked, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?"}

{"original": "If Critical Supplies Run Out, Here's How Hospitals Will Make Tough Choices\\n\\nIf crucial medical resources such as ventilators are in short supply, hospitals are supposed to follow ethics protocols to decide who gets treated. But those rules vary, and aren't always clear.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nAs New York hospitals run low on ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic, Americans face the fearsome new possibility that doctors may be forced to essentially play God, decide which patients get lifesaving care and which will not. But this kind of rationing doesn't have to be arbitrary. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, there are people who've worked for years to prepare for this kind of situation.\\n\\nMARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: In the years after 9/11, the federal government encouraged states to write guidelines for rationing medical care in a disaster. Now those plans are coming out.\\n\\nRON TELLES: We have reviewed them. That's a scenario which we hope will never happen.\\n\\nKASTE: Ron Telles is CEO of WhidbeyHealth, a small hospital on an island near Seattle. It's been gradually filling up with COVID-19 patients. But he's optimistic. Ten ventilators just arrived from the federal stock pile, he says. He compares the situation to Apollo 13, one crisis after another but ultimately survivable. But if rationing becomes necessary, he says it has to be a shared decision.\\n\\nTELLES: It cannot be just WhidbeyHealth. It has to be a region. It has to be a region because it doesn't work for one hospital to do that.\\n\\nKASTE: And that is how it's supposed to happen. Like many states, Washington has a plan to declare the start of rationing. The formal term is crisis standards of care. At one of the University of Washington's hospitals in Seattle, pulmonary and critical care specialist Randall Curtis says if that declaration were made, he and his colleagues would turn to the state's official rationing guidelines.\\n\\nRANDALL CURTIS: We would be consulting a grid if we got to that point.\\n\\nKASTE: Grids, checklists and flow charts would help them decide how to allocate certain kinds of treatment to certain kinds of patients. Curtis says the hospital's ethics committee has already been meeting to review the rules on how they would guide what he calls difficult decisions.\\n\\nCURTIS: So that we're using the ventilators to produce, you know, the maximal benefit for the largest number of people.\\n\\nKASTE: But what does maximal benefit mean? University of Maryland Health law professor Diane Hoffmann has closely followed the development of these state policies over the years as well as the ethical values that inform them.\\n\\nDIANE HOFFMANN: Usually, there's pretty much agreement on short-term survival. Would the person survive the virus and be able to leave the hospital?\\n\\nKASTE: But when it comes to long-term survival, Hoffman says there's less agreement. If resources get scarce enough, secondary considerations may become more important.\\n\\nHOFFMANN: Are we going to look at issues like dementia, other disabilities? And are we going to look at quality of life?\\n\\nKASTE: As COVID-19 advances, these questions are gaining new urgency. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a viewpoint article calling for ventilators to be allocated with an eye to, quote, the number of years of life saved. The American College of Physicians, on the other hand, put out a statement pushing back on that idea. Dr. Robert McLean is the ACP's president.\\n\\nROBERT MCLEAN: If we're using life years as a concept, it is inherently biased against the elderly or the disabled, who may not live as long after they would potentially recover.\\n\\nKASTE: These are thorny ethical problems even in the best of times, more so now in the midst of a mounting national crisis, which is why the committees of doctors, ethicists and lawyers spent so much time in recent years writing these state rationing policies. They were hoping to give hospitals some clarity in the midst of chaos. Vicki Sakata is an emergency room doctor in Tacoma who was instrumental in putting together Washington state's policy.\\n\\nVICKI SAKATA: My goal is, you know, to give our providers something in hand to know how to do it. It's terrifying, obviously, for a lot of people, but we need to have information. And we need to have a process. And that's what I work to do.\\n\\nKASTE: And then she adds, as did every doctor in this story, that rationing is the last thing she wants to do and that they're doing everything they can to avoid it.

{"original": "Atlanta's Pledge To Clear Homeless Camps Fuels Anxiety Ahead Of Super Bowl\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephannie Stoke/WABE Stephannie Stoke/WABE\\n\\nAbout a dozen people, bundled up in coats and beanies, are reading Scriptures in downtown Atlanta's Woodruff Park. They're part of a Bible study for the Church of the Common Ground.\\n\\nThe church always meets outdoors. So one parishioner wonders during the lesson how the Super Bowl might affect their services.\\n\\nIf they're shutting down the streets here, she asked, how are we supposed to have church on Super Bowl Sunday?\\n\\nPastor Monica Mainwaring isn't totally sure.\\n\\nThe Super Bowl has created a lot of uncertainty for the people the church serves, who often are homeless. Rumors about what will happen to people in Atlanta's homeless encampments have been swirling ahead of Super Bowl weekend.\\n\\nOne of the Bible study attendees, Tony Hines, knows the rumors well. He has spent years living on the streets and is now hoping for housing.\\n\\nThis is what I've heard, he said. I heard if you get caught under bridges, you are going to jail.\\n\\nHines said that talk has made people anxious.\\n\\nPeople are scared because no one wants to be locked up thinking they had their freedom taken away, Hines said.\\n\\nI think there's a concern that the city wants to look prettier than it is.\\n\\nI think there's a concern that the city wants to look prettier than it is, Pastor Mainwaring said, or like it has less of an issue with people experiencing homelessness than we do.\\n\\nThe problem for Mainwaring is, although she can't confirm the rumors, she also can't refute them.\\n\\nJust two weeks before the Super Bowl, the city held a press call and said it would work to clear encampments.\\n\\nI think a lot of social service agencies and people who work with people experiencing homelessness thought why right now and asked that question, Mainwaring said.\\n\\nAnd for people like her, the city's answer hasn't cleared up the confusion.\\n\\nOfficials have said there has always been a law against encampments, also known as urban camping, and Atlanta has always enforced it.\\n\\nIn an interview with WABE, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms was emphatic.\\n\\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with the Super Bowl, Bottoms said. If it did, I would say it.\\n\\nInstead, the city has said clearing encampments is about public health and safety — consider, for example, the risks of lighting fires under interstates.\\n\\nThe city has also stressed that the goal is not to make arrests. Deputy Chief Operating Officer Jon Keen said teams are giving advance warning to those in the camps.\\n\\nAnd at the point of time we're actually clearing the encampments, we're also offering services and offering transportation, Keen said.\\n\\nBut even if those are the city's intentions, some providers have said the strategy contradicts Atlanta's own work on homelessness.\\n\\nEncampments can include those hardest to reach — people who have been living outside for some time and may deal with mental illness.\\n\\nCathryn Marchman, executive director of Partners for HOME, a city-commissioned nonprofit that leads Atlanta's strategy on homelessness, said helping those people requires trust.\\n\\nWe know that outreach work to unsheltered individuals is slow and steady, she said. It takes quite some time, in many instances, to move somebody who's been living outside to housing, but that is our goal.\\n\\nIt's why Atlanta is funding a new five-person team to focus specifically on street outreach.\\n\\nMarchman admitted that process of building relationships doesn't include sweeping encampments.\\n\\nI think if people are being moved from place to place then it can make that work more challenging, she said.\\n\\nStill, while providers may be struggling to interpret the city's stance on encampments, national observers can find it less perplexing.\\n\\nEric Tars, legal director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, is accustomed to cities hiding people who are homeless before major sporting events.\\n\\nIt's very understandable why the city might be trying to put the best spin on, what you know, really an appalling policy on its face, he said.\\n\\nBut Super Bowl or not, Tars said the policy is becoming tricky legal territory. Last fall, a federal court ruled that cities can't stop people from sleeping outdoors if there is no place for them indoors.\\n\\nIn a letter last week, the Southern Center for Human Rights reminded Atlanta of the ruling and argued it only has shelter beds for less than half of its homeless population.\\n\\nThe city has disputed the group's numbers, saying it has roughly 2,800 beds, not including those activated for cold weather. In 2018, volunteers found just over 3,000 individuals to be homeless in Atlanta.\\n\\nFor now, those at the Church of the Common Ground are waiting to see what happens. That includes Hines, who is expecting to be placed in housing after years of staying on the streets.\\n\\nHe and Pastor Mainwaring said how Atlanta treats the homeless during big tourist events matters.\\n\\nIt's important because it says something about who we are and how we are in relation to poverty and need and poor mental health and addiction, she said.\\n\\nMainwaring said those are problems that we know are not solved in a day — or perhaps even a Super Bowl weekend."}
{"original": "Trump's Tweets On Court Blocking 'Sanctuary City' Order: 5 Facts To Know\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\\n\\nPresident Trump has been tweeting about a federal court ruling that temporarily blocked his plan to suspend funding for sanctuary cities.\\n\\nThese are cities — among them New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and San Francisco — that have limited their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. For example, they may refuse to detain people who are in the U.S. illegally on behalf of the federal agents.\\n\\nNow, the Trump tweets:\\n\\nFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017\\n\\nOut of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ban case and now the sanctuary case is brought in ... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017\\n\\n...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this judge shopping! Messy system. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017\\n\\nHere are five key points to keep in mind about the court ruling and Trump's reaction.\\n\\n1. The court\\n\\nIt wasn't the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled against the administration on sanctuary cities. It was a single district court judge in San Francisco who issued the court ruling, which applies nationwide.\\n\\nThere is in fact no appeal yet, though if the case is appealed, it almost certainly will go to the 9th Circuit, and probably the Supreme Court.\\n\\n2. The numbers\\n\\nIt is true that the 9th Circuit is known as the most liberal circuit among the 13 federal appeals courts.\\n\\nThe 9th, which covers nine states, including California, is the biggest in the country in terms of area and population, and it was indeed reversed by the Supreme Court in eight of 10 cases that the Supreme Court reviewed and decided last term.\\n\\nBut that is not far off the average circuit reversal rate.\\n\\nIt is not true, as Trump has previously claimed, that the 9th is the circuit most reversed by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn the last Supreme Court term, the 9th Circuit came in second on that score. It came in third in the 2013-2014 term, and tied for fifth in the 2012-2013 term.\\n\\n3. The judge shopping\\n\\nOn the judge-shopping question — it is natural that many immigration cases come out of California. The state has the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which crunched some U.S. Census Bureau numbers.\\n\\n4. In law as in life, what goes around comes around\\n\\nConservatives during the Obama administration advanced and perfected a strategy of challenging Obama's executive actions in court. They brought cases in Texas, for example, a conservative state with conservative judges.\\n\\nA single Republican-appointed federal judge in Texas, for instance, blocked Obama's attempt to temporarily grant legal status to some immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\\n\\nThat judge, like the judge in San Francisco, said the president had exceeded the authority granted him by Congress and the Constitution.\\n\\nIn the San Francisco case on sanctuary cities, Judge William Orrick III, an Obama appointee, linked his decision to the Constitution's provision giving Congress control over the federal purse.\\n\\nCongress, he said, did not authorize putting such conditions on federal grants. To buttress the point, he cited an array of Supreme Court decisions that are stars in the current conservative firmament.\\n\\nAmong them: the court's 1997 opinion striking down a key provision of the Brady gun control law, and the court's 2012 opinion striking down a provision of the Affordable Care Act that cut off Medicaid money to states that refused to cooperate with the federal health insurance program.\\n\\nIn both opinions — one written by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and the other written by Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative George W. Bush appointee — the legal underpinning was that the federal government cannot commandeer the state's apparatus to enforce a federal mandate.\\n\\n5. The out-of-court rhetoric\\n\\nA rare pattern is emerging in the Trump administration's most highly visible court challenges. The president's own words, and those of his advisers, are being used against them.\\n\\nIn the travel ban case, the Justice Department's claim that this was a carefully crafted and narrow ban of Muslims in seven countries was contradicted by the president's repeated pledge during his campaign to ban all Muslims. Indeed, Trump adviser and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said that Trump's intent was to come up with a Muslim ban and make it legal.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the sanctuary city case, Justice Department lawyers argued that the executive order would affect only a few grants. But that is not how President Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions has talked about it. Both have portrayed the cutoff of federal funds as a club to force these cities to aid federal authorities in carrying out Trump administration immigration policies.\\n\\nIntern Lauren Russell contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Obama Administration Ends Refugee Policy That Favored Cubans\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dave Martin/AP Dave Martin/AP\\n\\nThe Obama administration is ending a two-decade-old policy that allowed Cuban refugees to enter the United States without visas.\\n\\nKnown as the wet-foot, dry-foot policy, it began in 1995 under then-President Bill Clinton in response to a wave of Cubans fleeing the island in boats. The U.S. turned away those who were intercepted at sea (wet-foot), while permitting Cubans who managed to get to U.S. soil (dry-foot) to stay and eventually become legal residents.\\n\\nAccording to The Associated Press, the policy shift, which is effective immediately, is part of the process of normalizing relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The U.S. has been pressing Cuba to take back people who are not allowed to stay in the U.S. The Cuban government has always opposed wet-foot, dry-foot, arguing that the policy encouraged people to leave.\\n\\nAs The Washington Post reports, Cuban migration has increased notably since July 2015 when the two countries officially renewed relations, ending decades of Cold War estrangement. A December 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service says the maritime route out of Cuba has become less popular as more migrants choose to enter the U.S by land. More than 46,000 Cubans without visas attempted entry in the 2016 fiscal year, many along the Southern border and twice as many as in FY 2014.\\n\\nIn a statement released late Thursday by the White House, President Obama said:\\n\\nEffective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with U.S. law and enforcement priorities. By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries. The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.\\n\\nThe president also announced the end of the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which allowed Cuban doctors and other medical personnel to seek temporary legal status in the U.S. Obama said the program risks harming the Cuban people and that such personnel are still eligible to seek asylum at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.\\n\\nBoth policy changes were condemned by Cuban-American Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who said in a statement, In another bad deal by the Obama administration, it has traded wet foot/dry foot for the elimination of an important program which was undermining the Castro regime by providing an outlet for Cuban doctors to seek freedom from forced labor which only benefits an oppressive regime.\\n\\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, released a statement saying the existing policy needed to be revamped, not ended. In particular, he said he wanted Donald Trump to reverse the cancellation of the medical professional program when he becomes president next week. Rubio added that he had spoken with Vice President-elect Mike Pence this evening and was heartened by the fact that in a week we will have a new administration committed to discarding the failed Cuba policy of the last two years."}
{"original": "Routine DNA Screening Moves Into Primary Care\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption GIPhotoStock/Cultura RF/Getty Images GIPhotoStock/Cultura RF/Getty Images\\n\\nIf you have a genetic mutation that increases your risk for a treatable medical condition, would you want to know? For many people the answer is yes. But typically such information has not been a part of routine primary care.\\n\\nFor patients at Geisinger Health System, that could soon change. Starting in the next month or so, the Pennsylvania-based system will offer DNA sequencing to 1,000 patients, with the goal of eventually extending the offer to all 3 million Geisinger patients.\\n\\nThe health system's test will look for mutations in at least 77 genes. Many have been associated with medical conditions — dozens of them, ranging from heart disease to cancer. Others have been linked to variability in how people respond to certain medicines based on heredity.\\n\\nWe're giving more precision to the very important decisions that people need to make, says Dr. David Feinberg, Geisinger's president and CEO. In the same way that primary care providers currently suggest checking someone's cholesterol, he says, we would have that discussion with patients: 'It looks like we haven't done your genome. Why don't we do that?' \\n\\nBut some physicians and health policy analysts question whether such genetic information is necessary to provide good primary care and whether handling such testing is feasible for many primary care physicians.\\n\\nThe new clinical program builds on a research biobank and genome-sequencing initiative called MyCode that Geisinger started in 2007 to collect and analyze its patients' DNA. That effort has enrolled more than 200,000 people.\\n\\nLike MyCode, the new clinical program will be based on whole exome sequencing, analyzing the roughly 1 percent of the genome that provides instructions for making proteins, where most known disease-causing mutations occur.\\n\\nUsing this analysis, clinicians could tell Geisinger patients whether they have a genetic variant associated with Lynch syndrome, for example, which leads to an increased risk of cancer of the colon and some other cancers. Or doctors could offer guidance to patients found to have an increased risk for familial hypercholesterolemia, which can result in high cholesterol levels and heart disease at a young age.\\n\\nStill other patients who undergo the exome sequencing might learn they have an increased susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, because of a gene variant that causes a severe reaction to certain medications used during anesthesia; the reaction can be fatal.\\n\\nGeisinger spokesperson Wendy Wilson says that what the company plans is very different from direct-to-consumer services like 23andMe — which tests customers' saliva to determine their genetic risk for several diseases and traits, only some of which are medically actionable, and makes the results available in an online report.\\n\\nGeisinger is prescribing DNA sequencing to patients and putting DNA results in electronic health records and actually creating an action plan, Wilson says. We are preventing disease from happening.\\n\\nGeisinger says its program will work like this: Samples of a patient's blood or spit will be used to get a DNA sample. After analysis, the results will be sent to the patient's primary care doctor.\\n\\nThe doctor will then take a 30-minute online continuing education tutorial to review genetic testing and get more information on whatever specific susceptibilities have turned up in that patient's results.\\n\\nAfter that, the patient will be informed and invited to meet with the primary care provider, along with a genetic counselor if desired. At that point the doctor and patient can discuss treatment and prevention options, including any particular lifestyle changes that might reduce the risk of developing the disease or condition.\\n\\nAbout 3.5 percent of the people who have already been tested through Geisinger's research program had a genetic variant that could result in a medical problem for which clinicians can recommend helpful steps to influence their health, Feinberg says.\\n\\nIn the clinical program, only actionable mutations will be communicated to patients. The health care team, for example, won't inform patients if they have a variant of the APOE gene that somewhat increases their risk for getting Alzheimer's disease, because that information wouldn't change anything about their medical treatment. (Geisinger is developing a policy for how to handle these results if patients ask for them.)\\n\\nInsurance companies typically don't cover DNA sequencing and do limit a patient's coverage for adult genetic tests for specific mutations, such as those related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, unless the patient has a family history of the condition or other indications they're at high risk. For each of the patients it tests, Geisinger will absorb the estimated $300 to $500 testing cost.\\n\\nMost of the medical spending in America is done after people have gotten sick, says Feinberg. We think this will decrease spending on a lot of care.\\n\\nBut some clinicians and academics outside Geisinger aren't so sure. One of them is Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice who has written books about the hazards of overdiagnosis and overscreening, including, Less Medicine, More Health.\\n\\nHe credits Geisinger with carefully targeting the mutations in which it looks for actionable mutations, instead of taking an all-encompassing approach. And he acknowledges that for some conditions, like Lynch syndrome, people with certain genetic mutations would benefit from being followed closely. But he questions the value of DNA sequencing to identify some other susceptibilities, such as some of the genetic variants related to cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nWhat are we really going to do differently for those patients? he asks. We should all be concerned about heart disease. We should all exercise; we should eat real food.\\n\\nWelch says he's also concerned about the cascading effect of expensive and potentially harmful medical treatment when a genetic risk is identified.\\n\\nDoctors will feel the pressure to do something — start a medication, order a test, make a referral, he warns. You have to be careful. Bad things happen.\\n\\nOther clinicians question primary care physicians' comfort with and time for incorporating DNA sequencing into their practices.\\n\\nA survey published this month in the journal Health Affairs queried nearly 500 primary care providers in the New York City area and found that, in the past year, only a third of them had ordered a genetic test, given patients a genetic test result or referred someone for genetic counseling.\\n\\nOnly a quarter of the survey respondents said they felt prepared to work with patients who had genetic testing for common diseases or were at high risk for genetic conditions. Just 14 percent reported they were confident they could interpret genetic test results.\\n\\nEven though they had training, they felt unprepared to incorporate genomics into their practice, says Dr. Carol Horowitz, an internist and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who co-authored the study.\\n\\nA busy primary care practitioner herself, Horowitz questions the feasibility of adding genomic medicine to regular office visits.\\n\\nGeisinger is a very well-resourced health system and they've made a decision to incorporate that into their practices, she says, adding that in Harlem, where she practices, it could be a daunting challenge. Our plates are already overflowing, and now you're going to dump a lot more on our plate.\\n\\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."}
{"original": "What Can Be Done To Improve Pace Of Vaccine Distribution?\\n\\nJoshua Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, tells NPR's Michel Martin what's working and what isn't when it comes to distributing the COVID-19 vaccines.\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nHappy New Year. We are going to start again with the battle against the coronavirus. We are, sorry to say, starting the new year with some of the same daunting challenges that marked the end of last year, with the virus continuing to spread, hospitals in many places becoming overwhelmed.\\n\\nAnd there is a new challenge - getting millions of Americans vaccinated. The Trump administration had set a goal of distributing 20 million vaccine doses to be administered around the country by the end of 2020. But so far, fewer than 3 million people have been vaccinated nationwide, that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nSo we're going to begin by trying to figure out what's going on with that distribution effort. For that, we are joined now by Joshua Michaud. He is associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. He's been following distribution efforts closely. And I do want to mention he has advanced degrees in health policy, economics and infectious disease epidemiology, so he knows whereof he speaks.\\n\\nJoshua Michaud, welcome. Thank you for joining us.\\n\\nJOSHUA MICHAUD: Thank you. It's great to be with you.\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, first of all, the federal government says it's distributed more than 12 million vaccine doses to the states, but it's leaving it up to each state to actually get those shots into people's arms. So it seems that the effort is pretty slow and chaotic. I mean, how are the states doing? And why are we seeing these problems?\\n\\nMICHAUD: Yeah, I think what we're seeing now is what we expected to see, which is a lot of variation in how states have been able to roll out their vaccine programs. Some states are doing quite well. And you can look at examples like West Virginia, where they've actually completed vaccinating their nursing home residents and are close to completing their first-priority population. And the - there are other states that are doing, you know, less vaccination and have had a harder time scaling up the vaccines.\\n\\nSo part of the issue here is that we know that the two groups that have been targeted for initial vaccination are the health care workers, especially those working directly at the front lines, and persons in nursing homes, staff and residents. And the health care workers' piece has been moving along a little bit faster.\\n\\nBut really, I think much of the discrepancy between the number of doses that have been distributed and the number that have been administered comes from the fact that the Federal Pharmacy Partnership, which is responsible for doing a lot of the vaccination of nursing home residents, has gotten off to a real slow start in a lot of states.\\n\\nMARTIN: We're talking about that federal partnership with CVS and Walgreens that's supposed to be tackling immunizations for long-term care facilities. Is that what you're talking about?\\n\\nMICHAUD: That's right. Yeah. The name of the program is the Federal Pharmacy Partnership, and it's the program where the federal government through its interagency program, Operation Warp Speed, delivers doses of vaccines directly to CVS and Walgreens, who are responsible for going to nursing homes and vaccinating people there. And that program has received on the order of 2.2 million doses distributed but have only been able to vaccinate about 280,000 people through that program, at least according to the numbers that are on the CDC's website.\\n\\nMARTIN: Well, I'm sorry we don't have more time to discuss this, but I just want to sort of see if we can get some clarity about what would improve this. I mean, the U.K. government announced a few days ago it's prioritizing giving as many people as possible their first dose of a COVID vaccine rather than providing the required second dose as quickly as possible. Some say the U.S. should do the same. I take it you're not a fan of that suggestion. So what would make a difference here? What would improve things?\\n\\nMICHAUD: Well, the U.K. is in a different circumstance because they're talking about doing that approach with a new vaccine that they've just approved for use, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. Of course, they have access to some of the Pfizer vaccine, which is one of the vaccines we have here. But they are really worried about this new strain of the virus, the new variant, which is - potentially has increased transmissibility and would cause a surge upon the surge that they're already facing.\\n\\nAnd so they're really pulling out all the stops. And one of the ways that they're doing that is by using all available doses that they have, at least according to their plan, and vaccinating as many people as possible. I think that here in the United States, there's no real movement, at least that I can see, towards doing something similar. We are experiencing problems with our rollout. It's gone slower than we had hoped.\\n\\nMARTIN: OK.\\n\\nMICHAUD: But there's really no talk about getting one dose out to everybody right now.\\n\\nMARTIN: Sorry, Dr. Michaud. We have to leave it there for now. That's Dr. Joshua Michaud, who's associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThanks so much for talking to us today.\\n\\nMICHAUD: All right.

{"original": "Putin Commits To Pullout From Syria Amid Cease-Fire\\n\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has ordered most of his military forces withdrawn from Syria. Renee Montagne talks to Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\\n\\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\\n\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin shocked the world last fall when he deployed warplanes to Syria. He shocked the world again last night when he announced he is largely withdrawing them. Putin said Russia's objectives have been achieved.\\n\\nLet's talk now with Andrew Tabler. He's a Syria expert with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and he joins us via Skype. Good morning.\\n\\nANDREW TABLER: Good morning.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Let me start by asking what those Russian objectives are - military, political, both - that Putin says he's achieved.\\n\\nTABLER: Well, that's a very good question. Of course, President Putin intervened through the Syrian government in Syria to fight terrorism and terrorist groups in the country, including ISIS, which they held out as a major enemy.\\n\\nBut their military operations in the country didn't just target ISIS. It mostly targeted the moderate rebels. And now, somehow, despite the fact that Assad only gained back 5 percent of Syrian territory, Putin's declaring victory and sending his jets at least partially home.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, could it be that he did indeed prop up President Assad at a time when he was not looking in such good shape?\\n\\nTABLER: He did. And Russia played a weak hand in - at least in terms of Assad's domestic standing - very, very well. But the war in Syria is far from over. I don't think the Assad regime expected this. And it puts a lot of the military burden back on the Assad regime and its allies to keep their head above water.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: You mean expected this mostly withdrawal.\\n\\nTABLER: Correct. And it is just an unusual twist on the first day in Geneva when the U.N. was meeting with representatives of the Assad regime for that - for the Russians to suddenly pack up and at least partially take their military hardware home.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, let me ask to get another perspective here. President Obama predicted the Russian deployment to Syria would lead to a, quote, quagmire. That hasn't quite happened.\\n\\nTABLER: No, it hasn't. Russia's not necessarily stuck in Syria. But I think this decision indicates that the - that in Moscow there is considerable concern about the regime's lack of manpower and that the regime will not make concessions - political concessions - that can rebuild the country without facing the hard facts in the battlefield. And I think President Putin has just delivered those hard facts back to President Assad much more than he anticipated.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, just briefly, Putin did say part of the reason for the withdrawal was that there's a cease-fire in place and peace talks have begun in Geneva. What then do you see - where do you see this going?\\n\\nTABLER: Well, it's a good question. It's only a cessation of hostility, so the war, including Russian airstrikes, continue. That's the strange part. Also ISIS still controls about 50 percent of Syrian territory.\\n\\nIt's an unusual twist. We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming days and what the Russian withdrawal, quote, from Syria really means.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, we do have just about 30 more seconds. What does this mean to Assad?\\n\\nTABLER: For Assad, this was, I think, very unexpected. It is going to have to soften up, I would think, their position. They've been projecting over the last few days before the talks that they were unwilling to talk about a transition or the issue of the presidency. And of course I think now without Russian support they're going to have to talk about that. And they don't want to talk about anybody else but President Assad as president of the Syrian Arab Republic.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Thank you very much for joining us.\\n\\nTABLER: My pleasure.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Andrew Tabler is the Martin J.

{"original": "Counterterrorism Expert Hopes Capitol Siege Is 'A Wake-Up Call'\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nWe're going to go back now to the questions of accountability and the way forward after the violence at the Capitol Wednesday. In recent years, far-right extremism has become increasingly visible and perhaps even accepted in some quarters in part because of President Trump's own rhetoric or refusal to criticize it. So where do we go from here? We called Mary McCord to help us think about that. She served as the acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice. And she is currently the legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, where she's been researching and writing about these issues.\\n\\nMary McCord, thank you for joining us once again. Although, of course, we're very sorry about the circumstances.\\n\\nMARY MCCORD: Yes. Thank you for having me. And I couldn't agree more. It's a terrible situation that we find ourselves in having to talk about this.\\n\\nMARTIN: So to begin with, let's talk about how to talk about this. I mean, there have been a lot of terms used to describe what happened Wednesday. Some are calling it a protest. Others are calling it an insurrection. Some are calling it domestic terrorism. Given your expertise, how do you characterize what happened Wednesday and why?\\n\\nMCCORD: I mean, I guess in some ways it's all of the above, but I think it certainly most jumps out at me from a legal perspective as an insurrection because it was an attempt not so much to overthrow the entire government but to prevent the fulfillment of governmental functions, which on that day, January 6, was the joint session of Congress who gathered pursuant to federal law to count the Electoral College votes of the states and to certify the president and the vice president as the winners of the election. And that would be Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And so this insurrection was an attempt to stop that and in fact, for at least several hours, was successful in preventing that vote.\\n\\nMARTIN: Can you talk a bit about how the law treats acts of violence committed under these kinds of circumstances? Because as you certainly know, there has been a very robust conversation going on about the fact that these rioters seem to have been treated with a lot more leniency than we have seen in other circumstances - social justice protests, Black Lives Matter. So there are two questions there. One is a tactical question, how law enforcement specifically chose to deal with it. But then there's the legal question. I mean, does the law see the - this kind of conduct conducted for these particular reasons in a particular way?\\n\\nMCCORD: I mean, the criminal law has all kinds of - really, a menu of options that are applicable to the conduct of the insurrectionists at the Capitol on Wednesday; I mean, everything from the assault on the federal law enforcement officials, the violent and unlawful entry into a restricted U.S. government building, the destruction of U.S. government property, the stealing of U.S. government property, insurrection itself, seditious conspiracy. And I also would say, even though there is not a crime called terrorism that applies to this, this would certainly fit within the definition of crimes intended to intimidate or coerce and influence a policy through intimidation or coercion.\\n\\nIn terms of the handling of this differently than what we saw over the summer, I think there's no question it was very much soft policing, so soft that it was immediately overrun by the insurrectionists and the rioters. And we saw hard policing this summer in Washington, D.C., as well as other places around the country. And I think there's a couple reasons for that. I mean, one is I think, you know, we'd be foolish to ignore the fact of the difference between this being a bunch of white people, primarily white people who were supporters of the president as opposed to the summer's events being racial justice demonstrators who were very mixed race. Certainly, obviously, a lot of Black Americans but also a lot of white Americans and other Americans of color and non-Americans as well participated in those. And I think that's something that has to be looked at, that disparity that seems to be based on, at least in many ways, the color of the skin and the support - the political support of the protesters.\\n\\nBut beyond that, I think there's some - also just factual tactical missteps here. I think the Capitol Police - you know, I think in part as a result of criticism of heavy-handed techniques this summer, there was an effort by law enforcement to try to engage in soft policing, which I would say, in general, we should agree with, right? I think we'd like to see more soft policing instead of hard policing when it comes to First Amendment-protected activity.\\n\\nThe problem was this devolved from First Amendment-protected activity into a violent mob really fast. And at that point, that soft policing is not good enough. And that's where the Capitol police were completely overwhelmed, unprepared. And it's frankly unfathomable to me why they were so unprepared because the intelligence was available, the information was available. It was online. We knew these demonstrators were going to go to the Capitol. We knew they were going to encircle the Capitol, and we knew that at least some among them wanted to do so violently. And once you have a crowd that becomes a mob, even those who had no intent to engage in violence are oftentimes swept up into that violence.\\n\\nMARTIN: President Trump will be gone in a couple of weeks. He will be - he will no longer be serving in that position, whether it's days from now or whether it's a week from now. It's a short period of time where he will no longer hold that office. But he as a person remains, and he still has access to some means of communication. So the question is - becomes - does this kind of - should we be planning for an era in which street violence promulgated by whoever is a reality? And if that is the case, what should happen?\\n\\nMCCORD: I think we have to recognize that, you know, maybe this is a wake-up. Like, we saw something that I don't think most people thought they would ever see in their lifetimes in America. A lot of the world didn't think they'd see that in America. And we saw it on Wednesday. And it's scary, and it's frightening. And I have to wonder - if they'd have gotten their hands on some actual legislators or Mike Pence, like, what might have happened to those legislators? It could have been worse even than it was. And it was quite bad. And I hope that's a wake-up call for people that we have got to stop with the extremism and, you know, get back to the business of trying to create a country where people have opportunity, you know? When everyone has opportunity, everyone can prosper. It's not a zero-sum game. And that's what I think people don't understand.\\n\\nMARTIN: Mary McCord is the legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. She also served as acting assistant attorney general for national security at the U.S. Department of Justice. That was from 2016 to 2017.\\n\\nMary McCord, thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us once again.\\n\\nMCCORD: Thank you, Michel.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Legalize All Drugs? The 'Risks Are Tremendous' Without Defining The Problem\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images\\n\\nOpioids are becoming the latest serious addiction problem in this country. Among these drugs manufactured from opium, heroin is the most serious, dangerous, cheap and available everywhere.\\n\\nIn April's edition of Harper's Magazine, Dan Baum has examined a new response to this latest addiction problem: the legalization of drugs.\\n\\nNPR's Linda Wertheimer asks Baum about how he began to delve into the topic of America's war on drugs and why he calls attempts at legalization a big risk based on our approach to solving the widespread problem.\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nYou go back, covering the war on drugs, I wonder if you could tell us the story which kicks off your article.\\n\\nI was starting a book on the politics of drug enforcement. And in 1994 I got word that John Erlichman was doing minority recruitment at an engineering firm in Atlanta. Well, I'm 60. Erlichman was one of the great villains of American History, a Watergate villain. And he was Richard Nixon's drug policy advisor. And Richard Nixon was the one who coined the phrase, war on drugs.\\n\\nWe have demonized racial and ethnic groups by the drugs that they do or don't use for a long time.\\n\\nAnd he told me an amazing thing. I started asking him some earnest, wonky policy questions and he waved them away. He said, Can we cut the B.S.? Can I just tell you what this was all about? The Nixon campaign in '68 and the Nixon White House had two enemies: black people and the anti-war left. He said, and we knew that if we could associate heroin with black people and marijuana with the hippies, we could project the police into those communities, arrest their leaders, break up their meetings and most of all, demonize them night after night on the evening news. And he looked me in the eyes and said, Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\\n\\nIf that really was the beginning of the war on drugs — if it rose out of politics, not out of need or concern for people's health or safety. If Mr. Erlichman was serious about what he said, then obviously the results of that decision have been enormous.\\n\\nCatastrophic. And, you know, he's not the first and Richard Nixon was not the first. The first drug laws in America were the opium laws in San Francisco in 1912, obviously passed to punish the Chinese. I found transcripts of state legislature debates from the 1930s where legislators in the South were talking about the menace of cocainized negroes threatening the white womanhood, terrible language against Mexicans and marijuana going back to the 30s. We have demonized racial and ethnic groups by the drugs that they do or don't use for a long time. Nixon brought it to a high art. The drug war that we are suffering under now really begins with him.\\n\\nDo you think that the drug industrial complex, the production and distribution of drugs, and the incredibly big law enforcement effort to contain it — do you think that actually could or should be backed down by making illegal drugs legal?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images David McNew/Getty Images\\n\\nI do. Look, we're Americans. We know how to do regulation. We know how to do taxation. Thank goodness we're not very good at repression — and that's what we've been trying to do for a long time. Drug use is not the problem, it is the Americans who become dependent on them that is our drug problem ... It is tragic for the people involved, it is tragic for their family members, but it is a small problem.\\n\\nWhat do you mean it's a small problem? I think everyone in this country is accustomed to thinking that this is a huge problem.\\n\\nDepends how you define the problem. If you define the problem as drug use it's big. But I don't define it that way. I define it as problem drug use — people who can't handle it, people who become dependent. And we're talking about maybe 4 million people in a country of 319 million people. I am not being flip about this, this is not something to ignore, this is something to manage better than we do precisely because it's so serious.\\n\\nDo you think we are headed toward more attempts at partial legalization?\\n\\n... Marijuana is a pretty dangerous drug. A person can do himself a lot of harm with marijuana and I think we need to acknowledge that.\\n\\nLegalizing drugs though, you say in your magazine piece that it's a terrible risk.\\n\\nOf course. As a very smart guy in the piece says, look at our alcohol distribution system. We would not call it a total failure because we have some drunk drivers and because some teenagers get ahold of alcohol. It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than prohibition — none of us wants to go back to that. Problems are hard to solve, they are easier to ameliorate. We could do a better job of living with these dangerous substances if we changed the way we think about them."}
{"original": "Former U.S. Ambassador Ford On Trump's Syria Policy\\n\\nThe Pentagon announced last week that the process of the U.S.'s deliberate withdraw from Syria has begun. Rachel Martin talks to Robert Ford, a former U.S. Ambassador to Syria, about the withdraw.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump has a warning for Turkey. He said on Twitter that if Turkey attacks U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria, the U.S. will, quote, devastate Turkey economically. Last month, the president announced that the U.S. is pulling all its troops out of Syria, and defense officials confirm that process is now underway. But the U.S. exit will leave Kurdish fighters vulnerable to an attack by Turkey. U.S. forces fought alongside Kurdish forces in the battle against ISIS. Now I am joined by Robert Ford, U.S. ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014. Ambassador, thanks for being here.\\n\\nROBERT FORD: Good morning. How are you?\\n\\nMARTIN: I am well. You support President Trump's decision to pull troops from Syria. Can you just briefly remind us why you think that's the best course of action?\\n\\nFORD: The reason I think it's the best course of action is that the American soldiers there have done about as much as they can in terms of reducing ISIS's capacity to threaten the United States. To totally eradicate ISIS, that's really a job that only Syrians, not American soldiers, can do.\\n\\nMARTIN: So what do you make of the president's tweet warning Turkey not to attack the Kurds? Do you think that will be enough to deter an action like that?\\n\\nFORD: Well, that's going to be hard. The animosity between the Syrian Kurdish fighters, this particular group in Syria and Turkey, goes back decades. And it's going to take very agile American diplomacy to keep the two sides from starting to fight again.\\n\\nMARTIN: What about this mention - the president, in that same tweet, just said the words create 20-mile safe zone. What does that mean? Can you provide - understanding you're not in the president's head, but can you give any more context to what that would look like on the ground?\\n\\nFORD: The tweet raises a lot of questions. The Americans and Turkey and this Syrian Kurdish fighting group have been discussing some kind of a border zone. That's been going on for weeks. But exactly how that would be done, what it would include - would it include Syrian Kurdish towns, for example? That's less clear.\\n\\nMARTIN: What does it mean when the president says he'll devastate Turkey economically? I mean, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked by reporters today traveling with him in the region. He said it wasn't really clear on what it did mean. Is it sanctions? What would it look like?\\n\\nFORD: Well, for example, the Trump administration applied punitive sanctions against Turkish exports to the United States because of the case of the American pastor Andrew Brunson, who had been held by the Turks for years. Would those sanctions be reimposed again? It's not clear. Again, you know, diplomacy by tweet can raise as many questions as it answers.\\n\\nMARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to get your reaction to a story that broke in The Washington Post over the weekend. It reveals that President Trump went to great lengths to conceal details of conversations he had with Vladimir Putin. That reportedly includes at least once taking the notes from his own interpreter and instructing that interpreter not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials. As someone with a long history in the State Department, a veteran diplomat, would that be an unusual move?\\n\\nFORD: Well, I was around summits involving George Herbert Walker Bush and Barack Obama and others, and I've never heard of a president taking translator's notes like that. You know, a president's desire for keeping conversations private is certainly understandable, but usually the top aides are included in understanding what was discussed, even if they weren't in the meeting. And the Trump administration seems to be going way beyond that in terms of trying to keep information limited. And it's not helpful in teams, diplomatic teams, being able to do the follow-up.\\n\\nMARTIN: Do you see this as a dangerous precedent?\\n\\nFORD: No. I don't think it's a dangerous precedent because every American president can set his or her own style. Richard Nixon's antics didn't create a precedent during the 1970s, for example. And he was a guy who loved privacy, too. But what I do think is, today, it's making the task of the State Department, it's making the task of the Defense Department, it's making the task of the National Security Council more difficult.\\n\\nMARTIN: Ambassador Robert Ford, now a senior fellow at both the Middle East Institute and Yale University. Thanks so much.\\n\\nFORD: My pleasure. Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Meet Evan McMullin, The #NeverTrump Movement's Last Hope\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of McMullin for President Inc. Courtesy of McMullin for President Inc.\\n\\nRepublicans opposed to Donald Trump are making a last-ditch effort to put forth an alternative to the GOP presidential nominee.\\n\\nEvan McMullin, a onetime chief policy director for House Republicans and a former CIA officer, is launching an independent presidential campaign with the help of political group Better for America.\\n\\nBlasting Trump as personally unstable and a real threat to our Republic, McMullin said on his website that he felt compelled to run as an independent.\\n\\nWith the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines, McMullin wrote. Our country needs leaders who are in it for the right reasons and who actually understand what makes this country the greatest on earth. Leaders who will unite us and guide us to a prosperous, secure future, beyond the dysfunction of a broken political system.\\n\\nIn an interview with ABC News shortly after announcing, McMullin said that both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were unacceptable.\\n\\nLook, Donald Trump is defeating himself. He is ensuring that Hillary Clinton is elected, he told ABC. I think they would both be absolutely terrible.\\n\\nMcMullin called Trump inhuman and an authoritarian who does not care about anyone but himself.\\n\\nI do believe he is a fraud and a con man and that's not something I say lightly, he continued.\\n\\nMcMullin also said he is strongly anti-abortion, calling it a test of our humanity and that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.\\n\\nTo say McMullin has an uphill battle ahead of him is an understatement. The deadline for filing as an independent presidential candidate has already passed in 26 states. But with three months left until the general election, some members of the GOP's anti-Trump movement are nonetheless rallying behind the Hail Mary alternative.\\n\\nRick Wilson, a veteran Republican strategist who's working with McMullin, said his phone's been ringing off the hook from big time donors and volunteers looking to assist with the former House operative's bid.\\n\\nWe don't have a Death Star of operations like Hillary Clinton or the celebrity of Donald Trump, Wilson said. But can we put a campaign together that gets on enough ballots? Yes. Can we raise the money? Yes, we can.\\n\\nA lot people have been looking for an alternative to the disaster on both sides, Wilson continued, argued that there's rare opening thanks to both Clinton and Trump's high unavailability ratings.\\n\\nThe money is coming. Americans are responding very quickly, McMullin told ABC News.\\n\\nAlthough McMullin starts out virtually unknown to the general public, he has a lengthy history in government work. He spent 11 years working at the CIA as an undercover operations officer in several conflict zones in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Before working at the CIA, he spent a year as a volunteer refugee resettlement officer in the Middle East and Africa for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Earlier in May, he gave a Tedx Talk at London's Business School discussing genocide and how individuals and companies can help to end it.\\n\\nFor the past three years, he's worked on foreign affairs, national security and women's empowerment policy for the House Republican Conference, though an aide said he was no longer an employee there.\\n\\nThe House Republican Conference has zero knowledge of his intentions, said Nate Hodson, a spokesman for the House Republican Conference.\\n\\nMcMullin's work as a policy director could strike a chord with those worried about Trump's lack of political and policy experience, even though McMullin himself has never held a position in public office.\\n\\nHe isn't corrupt and he isn't crazy. He's an accomplished guy who's served this country, Wilson argued.\\n\\nConservatives opposed to Trump have been trying to find an alternative for some time now, but McMullin is the only one who has actually gone through with a candidacy. National Review's David French had been mulling a bid and had the backing of the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol. But in June he decided to pass."}
{"original": "What Republican Voters Think About Georgia Runoff Elections\\n\\nPresident Trump's false claims about election fraud have put Georgia Republicans in a tough spot as they try to turn out voters ahead of Tuesday's runoff elections for two seats in the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\\n\\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Atlanta, where we have spent much of the day asking people - asking Georgia voters, asking Georgia election officials - for their reaction to that extraordinary call, the call between President Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the weekend, in which Trump pushed Raffensperger to overturn the state's presidential election result.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes.\\n\\nKELLY: Again, the man on the receiving end of that call, Brad Raffensperger - his office is right here, right over my left shoulder. We are in the Georgia capitol under the famous gold dome. And we have come here to meet reporter Emma Hurt of WABE. She has been reporting on the GOP in Georgia in this runup to tomorrow's runoff elections, which, of course, will determine control of the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nEmma Hurt, hi there. How are you holding up?\\n\\nEMMA HURT, BYLINE: Hi. Doing good. Welcome back to Georgia. Welcome home.\\n\\nKELLY: Thank you. Let's talk about Republicans, who have been busy attacking their own, we should say, for weeks now in Georgia, talking about Georgia. What is the impact of this latest twist of the President Trump phone call?\\n\\nHURT: You know, morale for Republicans right now is low. This is more of the same in a way from President Trump, questioning the election and putting really direct pressure on Republicans that previously endorsed him and that he endorsed. But this is next-level. And there are Republicans who are speaking out and saying, I'm - I've never felt this way before about it. And the question, though, of course, is, does this affect any Republican voters? Does this make anyone second-guess their vote? Does this make anyone second-guess voting at all? And that is what is striking fear in the hearts of many Republicans - has been for a while, but it has not eased up. In fact, this call has just made it worse.\\n\\nKELLY: Well, this is a question - a central question here. If you are a Republican in Georgia and your president, your Republican president, is telling you the vote in Georgia was rigged; it was illegitimate; there was fraud - why would you choose to participate in the process for the Senate runoff?\\n\\nHURT: It's a contradiction, and it's a contradictory message that the president has been giving for weeks now. And I keep asking this of Republican voters. What I'm hearing is, I still have to vote because what else can I do? And the candidates have been framing this as a message of if you want to keep fighting for the president, keep fighting by voting again. And we also should note that while the president is saying all of these things about the election system, he is telling people to vote too.\\n\\nKELLY: Just to note in passing the stakes and the contradictions in play here - President Trump's in Georgia tonight for a big rally in the northwest corner of the state. The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, is not invited.\\n\\nHURT: I've said this before. It's the twilight zone. I mean, to think months ago, Governor Kemp was the strongest surrogate that Senator Loeffler or Senator Perdue could have on the trail. He appointed Senator Loeffler, and he was one of the president's strongest gubernatorial allies. And here he is not being invited - is just mind-blowing for everybody.\\n\\nKELLY: I want to talk about the two Republican candidates in play here from Georgia for the U.S. Senate - David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler. Voters here who plan to vote for them or who have already voted for them early - is it because they like David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler? Or is this about the bigger picture of, if you're a Republican, you might not want everything in Washington - Congress and the White House - to be in Democratic hands?\\n\\nHURT: You know, it's a mix, right? Senator Perdue has been in office for six years, and so he has more of an established identity and reputation than Senator Loeffler, who was only appointed a year ago. But that divided government argument that you mentioned is really strong. I mean, we can see that there are split-ticket voters in Georgia. There are voters who want Republican policy still. And we see that in the general assembly too. We're here in the state capitol, where Republicans still control both chambers.\\n\\nKELLY: I wonder, Emma, as you report here in Georgia, are you starting to see any takeaways about the future of the GOP that might apply nationally? I mean, we're watching the divisions within the party play out spectacularly here in Georgia today. And the whole country is wondering, what happens to the Republican Party when President Trump is no longer president?\\n\\nHURT: Yeah, I think that this is really - you can make the argument that this is a microcosm of what the Republican Party is going to have to deal with and is already starting to have to deal with, where the president is asking - and in a way, forcing - Republicans to choose between him and everything else, whether that's the laws, the election system, the Electoral College. And he's punishing people who are not choosing him.\\n\\nBut also, I think the bigger lesson is for competitive states like Georgia. What damage could the president be doing to his party going forward? - because by sowing confusion, by undermining incumbent candidates like Brian Kemp, who was a very popular governor, you know, what is he setting them up for 2022? He's encouraged people to run against Governor Kemp, which is just wild. And as one Republican strategist told me, basically, if President Trump really does back a challenger to Governor Kemp in 2022, that could spell a Democratic governor in Georgia. He said, I can't guarantee much, but I can guarantee that.\\n\\nKELLY: That is reporter Emma Hurt of WABE sharing some of her latest reporting on Republicans here in Georgia. And here we are under the dome of the Georgia Statehouse.\\n\\nThanks so much for taking the time.\\n\\nHURT: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Financial Crisis Gave Candidate Obama A Boost\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP Charles Dharapak/AP\\n\\nA year ago, the big political conventions had just ended, and with Election Day less than two months away, a remarkable two-year competition for the White House was reaching a climax. Over the course of the campaign, there had been heated debates about the war and about national security, but suddenly there was just one story and just one issue: the economy.\\n\\nCable and business news channels warned of a financial free fall, of global markets in turmoil, and of stocks tanking as the crisis heated up.\\n\\nMeanwhile, President Bush, overshadowed for much of the year by the campaign to replace him, now had another major crisis to deal with. Last Sept. 18, Bush spoke in the Rose Garden.\\n\\nThe American people are concerned about the situation in our financial markets and our economy, Bush said. I share their concerns.\\n\\nEconomy And The Campaign\\n\\nThe two major party nominees also made it clear that they shared those concerns. The crisis provided a challenge for Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. Neither could make policy, but each needed to demonstrate his readiness to handle the crisis if elected.\\n\\nFor McCain, however, it presented an additional problem. His strength was national security, and he had built his campaign on his resume as a Vietnam-era prisoner of war and war hero. For the Arizona senator, the economy had been a weak spot throughout his campaign, going back to the primaries.\\n\\nWhen Lehman Brothers failed, a week after the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Republican candidate's first reaction was an effort to reassure the public.\\n\\nThe fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult times, he said while campaigning in the important battleground state of Florida.\\n\\nObama, on the trail in Colorado, pounced on that remark, seeing a chance to tie his opponent to Bush's economic policies.\\n\\nThis is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while Wall Street is booming and declare, as Sen. McCain did earlier this year, that we've made great economic progress under George Bush, Obama said at the time.\\n\\nThen came the attack that the Democratic nominee would repeat over and over in the coming weeks.\\n\\nThat is how you can reach the conclusion, as late as yesterday, that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\\n\\nThe Turning Point\\n\\nMcCain tried to explain his line, saying he was talking about the fundamental strength of American workers, but Obama kept up the attack. McCain's problems were compounded by a decision to suspend his campaign until Congress dealt with emergency legislation to bolster the economy. McCain even said he was canceling his appearance at a presidential debate, scheduled for days later in Oxford, Miss. He later reversed both decisions.\\n\\nEarlier in September, the McCain campaign was feeling good about how the race was shaping up.\\n\\nAfter the Democratic and Republican political conventions ended, polls showed the Republican with a modest lead in the polls. He had also received at least a temporary bounce from the selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. But once the economy became the issue, Obama took the lead and began to pull away.\\n\\nLooking back, this was the decisive moment in the fall campaign. But David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president and a top Obama campaign strategist, says the outcome wasn't so clear at the time.\\n\\nI think it became a great test of leadership at the moment, and I think it redounded to his benefit, Axelrod says.\\n\\nBut Axelrod said they couldn't say for sure it would break in Obama's favor at the time.\\n\\nAll we knew was a very serious crisis was in the offing and he wanted to deal with it in as serious a way as possible, Axelrod said.\\n\\nVoters Concerned By The Economy\\n\\nOn Election Day, Obama won handily, with polls showing that the economy was a major issue for voters.\\n\\nOnce he was in the White House, the serious crisis that dominated the campaign's final months continued for the new president. Within weeks of Obama's inauguration, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus package.\\n\\nToday does not mark the end of our economic troubles, Obama said, nor does it constitute all of what we must do to turn our economy around. But it does mark the beginning of the end.\\n\\nThe stimulus passed without a single Republican vote in the House and, in the nearly seven months since, the opposition has continued to accuse the White House of trying to spend its way out of recession while running up huge deficits.\\n\\nAmong the most persistent critics is Republican Whip Eric Cantor from Virginia.\\n\\nThis summer, Cantor told Fox News, I think it is fair to say that the stimulus is a flop.\\n\\nCantor complained about the continued job losses in the country and the rising rate of unemployment. The White House counters, however, that the benefits of the stimulus have only begun to be felt, and that without it the recession might have been far worse.\\n\\n'Road To Recovery'\\n\\nOn Labor Day, Obama attended a big union picnic in Cincinnati sponsored by the AFL-CIO. He defended his policies, saying people seem to forget how bad things were a year ago, even as he expressed displeasure that the job losses continue to mount — an additional 216,000 in August. Even in that number, however, Obama sees some reason for hope.\\n\\nFor the second straight month, we lost fewer jobs than the month before, and it was the fewest jobs that we had lost in a year, he told the overwhelmingly Democratic crowd.\\n\\nThen, kicking into campaign mode, Obama said: So, make no mistake, we're moving in the right direction. We're on the road to recovery, Ohio. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.\\n\\nStill, it demonstrates that the road to economic recovery can be long, hard and politically painful. It's a challenge for the White House to hang on to support along the way, a task made even more difficult for a president and a party that that took office promising to bring an end to the economic crisis."}

Since taking office in January, she's been juggling daycare and feeding schedules around meetings and late-night votes. She often ducks her 13-month-old under a nursing cover and continues on with her business.\\n\\nTran has been a working mom before; her older three children stay in northern Virginia with her husband while she's in Richmond. She was elected in November 2017, in the first wave of women to run for office after President Trump's election.\\n\\nTran says she made the decision to run when her youngest was a month old.\\n\\nSo she was with me throughout the entire campaign. We did a lot of door knocking together, Tran says.\\n\\nHer colleague, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, learned she was pregnant two weeks after announcing her own candidacy in early 2017. She says she was motivated to oppose President Trump's agenda, and finding out she was expecting a baby – twins, as it turned out – did not deter her.\\n\\nI knew that, you know, no matter what I thought, no matter what I had going on, this was so important. Because there needed to be a response and counterbalance to what he was bringing to the table, Carroll Foy says.\\n\\nFamily and friends helped her campaign through a difficult pregnancy that included bed rest and preterm labor. Carroll Foy and her husband are now parenting two healthy baby boys while she travels about an hour between her district and Richmond.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR\\n\\nI was very disappointed to come down to the General Assembly and find that there aren't nursing rooms readily available, she says. There aren't baby changing stations in the women's bathroom. We can't say that we want to be family-friendly, and that we want women to run for office and be successful and be great legislators when we're not doing things to help accommodate them as much as we possibly can.\\n\\nPaul Nardo, Clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates, says he and others in charge of managing the grounds are looking at ways to accommodate young parents, especially nursing mothers. It's a slow process, he says; the House chamber didn't even have a women's restroom until a renovation completed in 2007.\\n\\nThe historic nature of the Virginia Capitol doesn't help.\\n\\nWe're cramped for space in this office, to be honest, so having a dedicated room – everything's sort of spoken for, so we have to kind of retrofit and work around that, Nardo says.\\n\\nFor now, Nardo says two lactation rooms have been set aside in a nearby legislative office building.\\n\\nHaving gone through the first session with this many women of child-bearing and –rearing ages, we're working through it, Nardo says.\\n\\nWhile Democrats Tran and Carroll Foy are newcomers, other female lawmakers before them have had to navigate similar challenges, one at a time.\\n\\nIn 2008, Republican state Sen. Jill Vogel was the first Virginia state lawmaker to have a baby while in office. She remembers slipping away to pump breast milk, then sending it to her office with a Senate page.\\n\\nThey had no idea what they were delivering, Vogel says with a laugh.\\n\\nVogel says the work culture around politics has lagged behind the private sector in accommodating working moms. She says she often gets asked how she can be both a mother of six and a legislator – a question her male colleagues are less likely to face.\\n\\nIn a private sector job, you wouldn't think twice; you'd say 'Of course I can do both and be competent at both,' she says. So I didn't apologize.\\n\\nState Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat, was a state delegate in 2010 when she had her first child. She asked to borrow an empty office when she needed to pump, and she now offers her own office to staffers, lobbyists, and any other new moms at the Capitol who might need a space to pump.\\n\\nI even made a sign that had a picture of a cow that said, 'Do not enter,' McClellan says with a laugh. And it was like, you know, don't ask questions when you see that, just don't come in.\\n\\nMcClellan says it's important to accommodate young mothers in politics, in part because of the perspectives they bring to issues like education and childcare.\\n\\nYou get a different perspective once you are living that life. McClellan says.\\n\\nIt's a relatively new challenge; women have long been under-represented in elected office. It was just this year that the nation saw 25 percent of state legislative seats held by women.\\n\\nPolitics Colorado Has A History Of Women In Politics — And A Harassment Problem Colorado Has A History Of Women In Politics — And A Harassment Problem Listen · 4:06 4:06\\n\\nKatie Ziegler, program manager for the Women's Legislative Network at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says women with children have historically waited to run until later in life.\\n\\nIt has been much less common for women to run and serve with infants and toddlers, Ziegler says, and we've seen that in how few state legislatures and capitol buildings have fully figured out how they will accommodate nursing mothers.\\n\\nZiegle says some capitol buildings are beginning to make accommodations, and more will need to do so as women are elected in greater numbers.\\n\\nMultiple groups around the country are working to elect more women in the 2018 midterm elections.\\n\\nErin Loos Cutraro founded the nonpartisan group She Should Run, which is now part of a coalition dedicated to electing women of all stripes. She says bringing more women into public life will change both public policy and the workplace culture around politics.\\n\\nIt's not terribly surprising that many of these conversations around how to make the governing workspace more welcoming to new moms are, 'That's a new conversation!' she says. But everything changes when we add women to the equation. We get a stronger democracy. We get stronger policies. And so I think we are absolutely going to have to change the way we do business.\\n\\nThat change includes the U.S. Capitol, where this spring Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., will be the first sitting senator to give birth in office. She says there's no precedent for maternity leave in the Senate, and that her situation illustrates the importance of having a full range of women's experiences reflected in the lives of those who represent them.\\n\\nI'm one person facing this here in the Senate, Duckworth told NPR. But...there are women all across this country who are facing starting their families and there's no policy for them either – and they're not United States Senators and get the attention that I'm getting."}

{"original": "Democrats Gain Control Of Senate After Georgia Runoff Victories\\n\\nJon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's wins in the Georgia Senate runoffs cements Democrats' control of the Senate for the next two years, but comes as polarization and political violence are on the rise.\\n\\nNOEL KING, HOST:\\n\\nThe insurrection on Capitol Hill almost overshadowed a seismic political shift yesterday. Two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, won Senate races in Georgia. Those victories will give Democrats control of the Senate. Emma Hurt is a political reporter with member station WABE in Atlanta. Good morning, Emma.\\n\\nEMMA HURT, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel.\\n\\nKING: Georgia has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since the year 2000. Now there are two of them. This is a big deal.\\n\\nHURT: It is a big deal. And, you know, beyond the policy implications, Raphael Warnock will be Georgia's first senator of color and Jon Ossoff will be its first Jewish senator. You know, as we saw with Biden's narrow victory here, this is really a vindication for Democrats in Georgia after years of organizing, registering new voters and generally rebuilding their party after Republicans took control. But I do want to note that there was actually a third runoff on this ballot for public service commission, and the Republican candidate won that race. So since that's an obscure election without much name ID, a lot of Republicans are taking that as evidence of a pure party loyalty vote, you know, independent of Trump and the chaos that we've seen politically and evidence of the fact that this state is by no means solidly blue.\\n\\nKING: Oh, that's interesting. As Republicans, though, survey the wreckage of these Senate races, what are they saying? What are they blaming or who?\\n\\nHURT: Yeah, yeah. There are about two themes emerging, I'd say. First is the criticism of Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler's campaigns and their campaign message, that they really didn't have much of a positive message at all. They weren't telling people why they should want a Republican in office. The message was just don't vote for the other guys. They're socialists. They're scary. And secondly, President Trump simply. I mean, Perdue and Loeffler tied themselves really closely to the president even more so during this runoff. And, of course, Georgians narrowly defeated Trump in November. And so even though these Republican senators did better in November than the Democrats, the president, by refusing to concede his election, basically ensured that his name was still on this ballot, even though technically it wasn't. And I know that some people might be wondering, well, why did they do that? Why tie themselves to Trump? And one of my colleagues spoke with Brian Robinson, who's a Republican strategist here in Georgia, about that.\\n\\nBRIAN ROBINSON: They had no choice but to absolutely stand by that. With one tweet, one tweet that cost $0 in a race where we spent $800 million, Trump could have destroyed any chance that they had by depressing the Trump base.\\n\\nHURT: And, you know, there's also the fact that the president's claims of voter fraud very well could have depressed turnout by making people question the system. You know, anecdotally, I was driving back from president's rally in Dalton this week where he encouraged people to vote for Kelly and David, and I saw a boycott rigged runoff sign.\\n\\nKING: On our way out, what do the next couple of months look like in Georgia?\\n\\nHURT: Our legislative session starts next week, and Republicans still control the General Assembly, and a top priority for them is going to be voting reform. And it's going to be a really bloody fight. And then also 2022, one of these senators-elect, Raphael Warnock, is going to be up for reelection then.\\n\\nKING: Reporter Emma Hurt with member station WABE.

Drehsler was photographing asylum-seekers who had traveled to Tijuana, and she had never once been questioned by border officials for longer than a minute while re-entering the United States.\\n\\nBut beginning in December, every time she crossed back into the U.S. she was pulled into secondary for questioning. Agents asked her about events taking place in Tijuana and the people working with asylum-seekers. Two agents told Drehsler that they wanted her to answer questions for them because she was on the ground, while they weren't.\\n\\nThey wanted to know who I was working for and what I was seeing, Drehsler told NPR. They focused on the shelters, and people crossing illegally.\\n\\nDuring one of the stops, Drehsler was separated from her camera. She doesn't know if CBP went through it, but she was made uncomfortable by the position the agents were putting her in.\\n\\nThat's not part of my job, to keep getting stopped by these guys and doing their homework for them, she said.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ariana Drehsler for NPR Ariana Drehsler for NPR\\n\\nDrehsler is just one of dozens of journalists, volunteers and lawyers who have been interrogated by CBP at the San Diego border over the past several weeks, part of a trend that civil rights groups have deemed alarming. Other journalists stopped at the border have said that agents have shown them photo lineups of individuals, asking them to help identify activists and other organizers the agents described as instigating asylum-seekers.\\n\\nThat's not part of my job, to keep getting stopped by these guys and doing their homework for them.\\n\\nLast November, the Committee to Protect Journalists published an urgent report about increasing incidents of CBP agents searching journalists' electronic devices and questioning them about their reporting and their sources. The committee has been in touch with several of the journalists who have been stopped and interrogated by CBP.\\n\\nThe ability for journalists to protect their sources, the ability for them to protect information they gather in the course of their reporting, the ability for them to be seen as independent of law enforcement and not just another intelligence arm of the government, is so central to what journalism is, said Alexandra Ellerbeck, the organization's North America program coordinator.\\n\\nKitra Cahana, an American-Canadian photojournalist who has been covering the migration of refugees from Central America, has repeatedly been denied entrance to Mexico in recent weeks. Cahana had crossed back and forth across the border without incident before she was turned back after flying to Mexico City from Detroit on Jan. 17.\\n\\nFor me, this is a question of freedom of the press and our ability as the press to cover important stories like the migrant caravan, Cahana said. And I, along with other journalists, are effectively no longer able to cover the story of the migrant caravan.\\n\\nConcern about sensitive legal documents\\n\\nIn addition to journalists, volunteers working with asylum-seekers and lawyers who advise asylum-seekers on their rights are also becoming increasingly wary of CBP searches.\\n\\nOne attorney working with asylum-seekers in Tijuana told NPR that last month, agents went through sensitive legal documents she was carrying. She asked to remain anonymous as her organization continues to work in Tijuana. [The agent] asked me if I was interviewing people, and then he asked me what I did for a living. I said I was a lawyer, and he then began reading through my papers, she said.\\n\\nImmigration lawyers are now particularly concerned about their clients' privacy, after the recent implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols, a policy that aims to keep asylum-seekers in Mexico as their claim is processed. To meet with clients, American lawyers now have to travel to Tijuana, crossing the border and possibly exposing sensitive documents to CBP agents.\\n\\nAttorney-client privilege is huge and if they have the right to go through our laptops, through our phones, if I take a case file with me, and they want to make a copy of everything, that's definitely breaking attorney-client privilege, said Maria Chavez, an immigration lawyer based in San Diego.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said that lawyers will still be able to meet with their clients but has not detailed how or when. The first hearings for asylum-seekers returned to Mexico under MPP have not yet happened.\\n\\nLawyers barred from entering Mexico\\n\\nAt the same time that screenings of journalists and lawyers have ramped up, several lawyers have been barred from entering the country by Mexican authorities because of new alerts placed on their passports. Mexican officials have told the lawyers the alerts come from U.S. authorities.\\n\\nTwo lawyers from the Tijuana-based organization Al Otro Lado, which plays a central role in helping asylum-seekers navigate the U.S. immigration system, have been denied entry into Mexico in recent weeks.\\n\\nNicole Ramos, a U.S. citizen and lawyer with Al Otro Lado, had her expedited border crossing card confiscated by U.S. authorities last month and has since stayed in Mexico. It's the epitome of dramatic irony that the U.S. government is telling asylum-seekers that U.S. attorneys are going to come and handle their cases, but when you have some of the principal attorneys who handle refugees' issues on the border attempting to access Mexico, there are alerts placed on our passports which are causing Mexican officials to deny us entry or deport us, Ramos told NPR.\\n\\nThe ACLU and other organizations, including Al Otro Lado, filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday, aiming to stop the rollout of MPP.\\n\\nSeveral members of Congress have begun to investigate CBP's questioning practices. Sen. Ron Wyden's office says the senator has reached out to CBP with questions about its scrutiny of reporters and activists at the border.\\n\\nCBP declined repeated requests for comment about specific cases where journalists and lawyers have been barred from entering Mexico."}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,997.20 points, or about 13%, as coronavirus measures rapidly expanded. The S&P 500 index lost nearly 12%.\\n\\nThe Dow, which closed at 20,188.52, has lost 31.7% since its record high Feb. 12 as the market plunges deeper into bear territory after an 11-year winning streak.\\n\\nThe Dow's breathtaking drop Monday was the biggest since the Black Monday crash of October 1987, when the blue chip index lost 22%.\\n\\nThe deep stock market sell-off reflects broad concerns that despite these economic measures, the U.S. economy is likely heading toward a recession.\\n\\nMany parts of the economy have abruptly come to a standstill. On Monday afternoon, most of Bay Area shut down from a directive. San Mateo Mayor Joe Goethals said only police and fire departments, hospitals, grocery stores, pharmacies and a few other businesses will be allowed to remain open.\\n\\nIn the rest of the country, government orders temporarily closed restaurants and bars in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago and recommendations to ban groups of more than 10 people have been among the latest attempts to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe hard-hit airline industry is seeking $50 billion in aid and loans from the federal government. The rapid spread of COVID-19, along with the government and business-imposed restrictions on air travel, are having a unprecedented and debilitating impact on U.S. airlines, the industry group Airlines for America said.\\n\\nIn an afternoon news conference, President Trump said we're going to back the airlines, 100%.\\n\\nLeaders of the Group of Seven — the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom — agreed to work together to speed up and coordinate the global response to the pandemic.\\n\\nWe are mobilizing the full range of instruments, including monetary and fiscal measures, as well as targeted actions, to support immediately and as much as necessary the workers, companies, and sectors most affected, the G-7 said in a statement.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 index continued to fall after temporary trading halts were lifted on the New York Stock Exchange Friday morning. A 7% drop in the S&P 500 automatically forces trading to stop for 15 minutes, which has happened three times in the past week.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, the Fed took the extraordinary move of cutting rates by 1 percentage point to near zero. The last time it moved rates that low was in 2008, during the financial crisis.\\n\\nThe effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook, the Fed said in a statement.\\n\\nThe drops on Wall Street follow steep falls in Europe, where stock indexes were down as much as 11% Monday.\\n\\nOil prices fell nearly 9% to about $29 per barrel. They're down more than 50% so far this year.\\n\\nIn cutting its key interest rate to near zero, the Fed has not left itself much room to act on rates in the future. It has basically given up a major policy tool — one that it would need if the economy tumbled into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed also said it will buy $700 billion of Treasurys and other government securities to help grease the financial markets.

{"original": "What Free Speech Has To Do With Skim Milk, Condoms And Corporate Political Spending\\n\\nThe concept of free speech is frequently heard in courtrooms across the country. Advocates on all kinds of issues try to tie their legal and policy arguments to a constitutional right most Americans hold as fundamental. Consider recent debates over net neutrality, for example, or abortion rights.\\n\\nThe impetus for the First Amendment — granting Americans the freedom of speech, religion and the press and the right to petition and peacefully protest — stemmed from the view that the Constitution granted a lot of power to the federal government without much protection for citizens' rights, historians say. But many of the modern cases have less to do with citizens speaking to federal power than with the boundaries of businesses and organizations reaching into Americans' lives.\\n\\nBelow are a few of the cases from the 21st century that highlight both the versatility and the limitations of what the right to free speech has come to embody, at least in the U.S. justice system.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAbortion protest buffer zones\\n\\nMcCullen v. Coakley, 2014\\n\\nIn 2007, the Massachusetts state legislature created a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics that could be crossed only by people entering the facilities. Protesters and pro-life counselors who try to dissuade women from receiving abortions were barred from being inside the buffer zone.\\n\\nAnti-abortion-rights activist Eleanor McCullen, who stood outside the same Planned Parenthood in Boston every Tuesday and Wednesday for over a decade, argued that the buffer zones were an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. It's America, she said. I should be able to walk and talk gently, lovingly, anywhere with anybody.\\n\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled in her favor, finding that the buffer zones infringed on protesters' First Amendment rights. Massachusetts took the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his opinion. To curb harassment, he noted, the state could follow the lead of New York City, which made it a crime 'to follow and harass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a reproductive health care facility.' \\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nCensoring skim milk\\n\\nOcheesee Creamery LLC v. Putnam, 2017\\n\\nMost of the vitamin A that is found naturally in milk is contained in its cream — which is removed when milk is skimmed. Under Florida law, milk can only be labeled skim milk if it has the same amount of vitamin A as whole milk.\\n\\nThat was a problem for Ocheesee Creamery owner Mary Lou Wesselhoeft, who wanted to sell pure skim milk. If the creamery artificially added enough vitamin A, the product would meet Florida's skim milk label requirement, but Wesselhoeft didn't want additives of any kind in her product.\\n\\nWesselhoeft, represented by the Institute For Justice, filed a free speech lawsuit on the basis that the First Amendment protects the right of businesses to tell the truth. The case made it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where a three-judge panel ruled in her favor, saying: The Creamery's use of the words 'skim milk' to describe its skim milk is not inherently misleading.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brian Ach/AP Images Brian Ach/AP Images\\n\\nCondoms as art\\n\\nCalifornia Proposition 60, 2016\\n\\nProposition 60 would have allowed the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to prosecute producers anytime a condom is not visible in a pornographic film.

This led to the creation of a new type of political fundraising vehicle called superPACs, which contributed to the explosive growth of campaign spending. They now outspend the national political parties.\\n\\nAs NPR's Nina Totenberg put it, Citizens United represented one of the key cases showing how the Supreme Court has over time extended some — but not all — of the rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights to corporations.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nWords that inflict great pain\\n\\nSnyder v.

As NPR reported, the church members have traveled the country for years, picketing hundreds of military funerals to communicate their belief that 'God hates the USA' for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in the military.\\n\\nThe Marine's father sued the fundamentalist church for intentional infliction of emotional distress. But the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected the protesters from liability because the signs were about the country in general. Roberts wrote in the majority opinion:\\n\\nSpeech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and — as it did here — inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.

{"original": "Defined By Scandal At Voice of America, CEO Resigns At Biden's Request\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Agency for Global Media U.S. Agency for Global Media\\n\\nUpdated at 9:37 p.m. ET\\n\\nMichael Pack resigned Wednesday as the CEO of the federal agency over the Voice of America and other federally funded international broadcasters after a turbulent seven-month tenure. He leaves the U.S. Agency for Global Media with a Trumpian legacy of ideological strife, lawsuits and scandal, his departure effective just two hours after the swearing-in of President Biden, who requested him to leave.\\n\\nBiden has named senior VOA news executive Kelu Chao as acting CEO.\\n\\nPack came to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media with the support of former President Donald Trump; his appointment was delayed more than two years in the U.S. Senate by lawmakers who feared he was too ideological and also who questioned his finances. The soft-spoken conservative documentary maker proved to be an ideological warrior in the mold of his patron, taking to one conservative news outlet after another to denounce his own staff, all in the name of fairness.\\n\\nIn his resignation letter, Pack said he was solely focused upon reorienting the agency toward its missions. And he attacked the request for his resignation as a partisan act, saying the leadership of the agency and its networks is meant to be non-partisan, untethered to alternations in the political regime.\\n\\nHe added, I had no political agenda coming into USAGM, and I still do not have one.\\n\\nNPR conducted scores of interviews over the controversies Pack's actions engendered. And few at the agency or its broadcasters agreed with Pack's characterization of his mission or performance, instead characterizing him as seeking political control over their coverage. Just last week, a VOA reporter's insistent questions to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and VOA Director Robert R. Reilly over the siege on Congress after a public event led to her demotion and an investigation.\\n\\nPack routinely accused journalists of anti-Trump bias, sought to fire top executives as part of a deep state, ominously accused the networks of being receptive to foreign spies and denied requests for visa extensions from his own staffers who are foreign nationals.\\n\\nHe initiated investigations over the bias claims, reaching into Voice of America's newsroom in ways a federal judge said broke the law and the First Amendment. Pack hired a Richmond, Va., law firm to investigate top U.S. Agency for Global Media executives after already seeking to oust them; new allegations, backed by correspondence reviewed by NPR, suggest he paid more than $2 million to that firm to conduct such reviews. (The lead partner on the investigation, John D. Adams, was a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the subject of a sympathetic 2020 documentary by Pack.) Pack even fired White House aides assigned to help him by the Trump administration, suspecting them of disloyalty.\\n\\nThroughout, he kept all but a small circle of advisers in the dark as to what he was doing. Former U.S. Agency for Global Media general counsel David Kligerman said the agency would have to work hard to put a terrible chapter behind it. Kligerman, who resigned late last month, had been suspended by Pack in August, along with other senior executives after Pack was unable to fire them more immediately.\\n\\nPack seemed only to know how to destroy, Kligerman wrote in a statement to NPR, citing the CEO's record of firing or otherwise pushing out so many talented journalists, network heads, grantee board members, and civil servants.\\n\\nIt was wanton destruction, and shocking disregard for the most basic civility or norms, Kligerman wrote. Political staff targeted and terrorized career staff and others. It is hard to overstate the climate of fear and dread that existed at the Agency. It is then particularly ironic that in his letter of resignation Pack warns of future politicalization of the Agency: it is hard to see how one could have attempted to do more to politicize the Agency than Pack.\\n\\nPack sought to ensure his influence endured after his departure by forcing the networks the agency funds but does not own to accept new boards of directors stocked with conservative activists and writers. The networks include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. (VOA and Radio/TV Marti are owned by the federal government.)\\n\\nThe new board members, announced this month, include Roger L. Simon, a columnist for the pro-Trump and conspiracy-theory recycling newspaper The Epoch Times who has written he believes the Jan. 6 attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob was actually done by leftists in disguise, and Christian Whiton, a conservative foreign policy expert who has defended Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\\n\\nAccording to three people with knowledge, the new Biden team appears poised to bring suspended executives back into the agency fold, replace the network chiefs appointed by Pack last month and to appoint new boards. The Biden administration did not immediately comment on Pack's departure. A permanent CEO for the U.S. Agency for Global Media will require approval by the Senate, now led by Democrats rather than Republicans, though Pack inspired an outcry on both sides of the aisle.\\n\\nDisclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR media and technology editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published."}

Members of the white nationalist movement were among the first to embrace Trump's candidacy, and they celebrated after his election.\\n\\nJan. 20 reflects a significant defeat for egalitarian orthodoxy, Taylor says.\\n\\nTaylor promotes a very different orthodoxy, one in which race is central to innate abilities and national success. He is working to build a United States explicitly for white people. Trump arguably helps this by telling supporters that they're the victims of a system rigged against them.\\n\\nI see Donald Trump as a kind of steppingstone. He is a step in the right direction in terms of understanding America and history and the world in essentially racial terms, Taylor says.\\n\\nBut white nationalist enthusiasm for Trump has fallen off substantially. Since the election, the so-called alt-right has splintered, and the movement now looks a lot less potent than it once appeared.\\n\\nTo understand that, it helps to go back to the heady days just after the election.\\n\\nIt's too much winning! Could someone please just stop winning, I don't want to win anymore, Richard Spencer, who coined the term alt-right, told a room full of fellow radicals in November. Spencer said that Trump's victory had just slingshot white nationalism into the mainstream.\\n\\nAnd even if we're not quite in power yet we should act like it, he said.\\n\\ntoggle caption Ariel Zambelich/NPR\\n\\nBut later that day, Spencer gave another speech, a fiery one that ended with some of the audience casting off any pretense of being mainstream.\\n\\nHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory! Spencer shouted, raising his glass in a straight-arm toast to the audience.\\n\\nSome in the crowd responded with enthusiastic Nazi salutes, which captured media attention.\\n\\nRight after the election, I think it was euphoria, says Kevin MacDonald, a retired evolutionary psychology professor at California State, Long Beach and another white nationalist mainstay. But as we get into it now, there's more trepidation.\\n\\nMacDonald says Trump's appointments also have rattled the movement, especially his propensity for tapping rich Wall Street bankers.\\n\\nThese are globalists in general. They love free trade, they love immigration — big red flags for us, he says.\\n\\nAnd MacDonald says he is concerned about the reliance on generals and hawkish policy leading America into another Middle East war.\\n\\nLot of trepidation, but the big silver lining is Jeff Sessions, he says.\\n\\nMacDonald hopes Sessions, Trump's nominee for attorney general, will clamp down on immigration. White nationalists also like the nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who is seen as being close to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a darling of the alt-right.\\n\\ntoggle caption Ariel Zambelich/NPR\\n\\nBut despite its high hopes for the Trump administration, the radical right has largely gone to war with itself. Mark Potok, with the Southern Poverty Law Center, says much of what was once called the alt-right has peeled away.\\n\\nI mean look, we are talking about a movement which spends literally more time attacking one another than they do attacking their enemies, Potok says.\\n\\nNo one has taken more fire from his ideological kinsmen than Spencer. Like-minded radicals have disavowed the alt-right, even called Spencer an operative bent on the movement's destruction. In the media, he is always tied to those Nazi salutes.\\n\\nI think it's good to be the person talked about, even when it's negative, Spencer tells NPR. Our ideas are entering the discourse.\\n\\nBut Marilyn Mayo with the Anti-Defamation League argues that the alt-right is watching its illusion of real world influence whither.\\n\\nAt some point, they may have felt that they could influence policy in some way, but I think that was really a pipe dream for them because they really are a fringe movement, and they're still a fringe movement, Mayo says.\\n\\nA movement that sprang from obscurity with Trump's election seems to be dropping back into the shadows even before Trump takes power."}

Muslims lean Democrat, but they're less likely to be registered than your average American.\\n\\nSo at a mosque in Orlando this week, Mohamad Shatara grabbed a clipboard as soon as prayers finished. Shatara is the regional organizing director for the Democratic Party in nearby Volusia and Flagler counties.\\n\\nHe asked worshipers if they were registered to vote and soon met an Arab man who had been a citizen for 20 years but had never voted.\\n\\nThe Muslim community, more than ever we need somebody, we can't have somebody that wants to throw us out. We need you, Shatara told the man and, eventually, convinced him.\\n\\nSome of this outreach is organic: Muslims are no doubt motivated by the Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has threatened to ban Muslim immigrants and monitor mosques.\\n\\nFarooq Mitha, who was hired last month as the Clinton campaign's national Muslim outreach director, says he has heard that echoed when he talks to Muslim voters.\\n\\nThe number one thing I really hear about is the fear that Muslims have, Mitha said, The biggest concern that people have is domestic: Can I send my kids to school without them worried about getting bullied, for example, or am I safe to go pray at a mosque?\\n\\nMitha travels the country to mobilize and organize Muslims. He also has state-level directors in Florida and Michigan. The campaign says Clinton spoke with her aide Huma Abedin early on in the campaign about creating a Muslim outreach director, and Clinton felt it was important - and thought a similar role during her time at the State Department was effective.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR\\n\\nMitha says his role and the emphasis on reaching Muslims is a sign Clinton wants to engage a community that historically has not been a part of campaign infrastructure.\\n\\nBut he has skeptics, like Democratic activist Ali Kurnaz.\\n\\nMuslims, I don't think, want to vote for Donald Trump. But if we're going to have to vote for Hillary Clinton, Kurnaz said, Then please, Hillary Clinton, you should offer us some substantial policy positions we can rally behind.\\n\\nSome Muslims, like Kurnaz, worry Clinton disregards Palestinian rights and is too hawkish in her foreign policy. Kurnaz was a Bernie Sanders delegate at the DNC.\\n\\nSanders was, in fact, hugely popular with Muslims. One of his biggest supporters was Keith Ellison, a Muslim congressman from Minnesota.\\n\\nBut these days, Ellison is traveling the country to convince Muslims to support Clinton.\\n\\nI've gone to Nevada, Nebraska, California, Florida, Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ellison said, And I'll respond to them.\\n\\nEllison's role is indicative of how Muslim outreach is changing.\\n\\nIn 2008, the New York Times reported that Ellison volunteered to campaign for Obama at a mosque in Iowa but Obama aides asked him to cancel it.\\n\\nThen, two Muslim women were prevented from appearing behind Obama at a campaign rally because of their headscarves.\\n\\nThe number one thing I really hear about is the fear that Muslims have... Can I send my kids to school without them worried about getting bullied, for example, or am I safe to go pray at a mosque?\\n\\nThe Obama campaign tried to fix some of this messaging by hiring a Muslim outreach director: Mazen Asbahi, a lawyer in Chicago. But Asbahi was on the job just three weeks.\\n\\nIt didn't take long for the far right to try to do some negative research. They made a guilt by association attack, Asbahi said.\\n\\nCritics tied Asbahi to a somewhat controversial imam in the Chicago area (the two men had served very briefly on the same board of an Islamic investment fund). It was an accusation akin to the the kind of attacks people now use against Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Asbahi had to resign.\\n\\nBut Asbahi feels the country has changed and that 2016 is a different climate, a different culture, and a different candidate.\\n\\nThe type of guilt by association attacks that were made about me - today, would be brushed aside, Asbahi said.\\n\\nAnd Ellison agrees.\\n\\nSeven Muslims addressed the delegates at the Democratic National Convention. Never before have we seen any. In neither 2008 or '12 were any Muslims on the dais at all, Ellison said.\\n\\nThe congressman points out that before this election, anti-Muslim rhetoric was coming from random haters. Now, it's coming from the GOP frontrunner.\\n\\nEllison said he sees the party's Muslim outreach as the Democratic party saying, 'Hold on. Wait a minute. This is not a phase.' And continued: You know, we must confront this intolerance.\\n\\nOne side-effect of Donald's Trump rise is that the Democratic Party is now publicly embracing Muslims.\\n\\nAnd that is a clear change from the past."}

There's no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.\\n\\nBiden's plan comes just weeks after Congress passed a $900 billion relief plan that took weeks of painful negotiations. But economists have said the economy would need additional help as new coronavirus infections continue to surge, and as the daily death toll from COVID-19 exceeds 4,000.\\n\\nThe pandemic is dealing fresh blows to the U.S. economy, with more than 1.2 million Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the first week of the new year.\\n\\nHere are some key aspects of the plan:\\n\\nCOVID-19 shots\\n\\nWhile newly approved vaccines offer hope for relief from the pandemic, Biden described the sluggish initial delivery of the shots as a dismal failure.\\n\\nThe Trump administration invested heavily in developing a vaccine, but has left distribution largely up to states. The number of shots delivered so far has fallen far short of what was promised.\\n\\nWe'll have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated, Biden said. To mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms, to increase vaccine supply, and to get it out the door as fast as possible.\\n\\nBiden called for a $20 billion campaign to speed vaccinations, including the launch of community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units to deliver the shots to hard-to-reach areas.\\n\\nPolicy makers and experts have said a long-term recovery of the economy is unlikely until the pandemic is under control.\\n\\nThe single most important economic policy in this is health care policy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday during a webcast with Princeton University. It's getting control of the spread of the virus, which we have not been able to do with much success yet. But it's also developing medical innovations for treatment and ultimately vaccination.\\n\\nBiden's plan also calls for hiring 100,000 additional public health workers, and a more robust surveillance system to watch for new and challenging mutations of the virus.\\n\\nHelp for struggling Americans\\n\\nThe president-elect praised Congress for approving additional economic relief last month, but cautioned that was only a down payment.\\n\\nBiden will now ask lawmakers to spend heavily on measures designed to cushion the economic fallout from the pandemic, including expanded unemployment benefits and additional direct payments to most Americans.\\n\\nAmong the measures he will propose are $1,400 in relief payments to most adults and children, which would come in addition to the $600 payments that were approved in December.\\n\\nCongress voted last month to extend emergency unemployment benefits through March and boost those benefits by $300 per week. Biden's plan would increase the additional benefits to $400 per week, and extend them through September, or longer if economic conditions warrant.\\n\\nAs of mid-December, more than 18 million Americans were receiving some form of unemployment assistance. The economy has recovered just over half the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring, and payrolls shrank in December for the first time in eight months.\\n\\nThe plan would also extend a federal moratorium on evictions through September and provide $30 billion in additional aid to struggling renters.\\n\\nRescuing small businesses, local governments\\n\\nBiden also proposed $350 billion in emergency funding for state and local governments — an idea which congressional Republicans have so far rejected.\\n\\nState and local governments have cut 1.3 million jobs since the pandemic began and have struggled financially as tax revenues declined while costs related to fighting the pandemic surged last year.\\n\\nBiden's plan also calls for $15 billion in grants to small businesses, as well seed money for as much as $175 billion in low-interest business loans.\\n\\nThe president-elect suggested Congress pay particular attention to helping restaurants and other in-person businesses that have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic.\\n\\nLooking ahead at recovery\\n\\nLastly, Biden advisers have characterized his proposal as a combination of rescue measures to combat the immediate pain of the recession and recovery initiatives designed to address longer-term economic challenges.\\n\\nThe latter category includes his push for a $15 minimum wage — a goal pushed by many Democrats but opposed by many Republicans — and increased tax subsidies for families with children.\\n\\nWe didn't get into all this overnight, Biden said of the nation's twin challenges of the pandemic and recession. We won't get out of it overnight. And we can't do it as a separated, divided nation. The only way we can do it is to come together. To come together as fellow Americans, as neighbors."}

Well, the president responded during a Cabinet meeting today.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I wish Mitt could be more of a team player, you know? I'm surprised he did it this quickly. I was expecting something, but I was surprised he did it this quickly.\\n\\nKELLY: Now, all of this fueled speculation that Romney might be eyeing a primary challenge to Trump in 2020. This afternoon on CNN, Romney denied that's the case.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, CNN)\\n\\nMITT ROMNEY: No, I'm not running again. And we'll see whether someone else does in a Republican primary or not. But time will tell.\\n\\nKELLY: He said he wasn't sure who he would vote for in 2020. And as you heard there, he brought up the possibility of a primary challenger, which raises all kinds of questions about how that might work.\\n\\nHere to answer those questions is Mike Murphy. He's a Republican political consultant. He has worked on campaigns for Jeb Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mitt Romney. Mike Murphy, welcome back to the show.\\n\\nMIKE MURPHY: Good to be here.\\n\\nKELLY: Yeah. You talk regularly with Romney. You've tried to convince him to run again. You going to keep working on him?\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, I think he'd be an excellent president. But I take him at his word today. And it reflects what I've heard from him, that he's not - this op-ed and what he's doing now has nothing to do with the 2020 race. It's more about being consistent to what he's already said. He'll support the president when, you know, they're aligned on policy. But when the president misbehaves, he's not afraid to criticize him.\\n\\nKELLY: Now, he did not rule out that another Republican might be tempted to run against President Trump. So let me ask you, what is the precedent for that in recent history for challenging a sitting president in the primary?\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, generally, you lose. (Laughter) That's the history of it. The most spirited...\\n\\nKELLY: A brief history.\\n\\nMURPHY: Yeah, so far. But we're in a different era now, so who knows what the future may bring? And I think the president's political troubles are not over. And we know from the midterms that the president has, you know, shown a weakness in leading the party, and there's concern rising.\\n\\nBut that said, Ronald Reagan in '76 came the closest, and he lost. Although, in all these cases - Jimmy Carter with Ted Kennedy on the Democratic side, et cetera - the nominee is often weakened in the general election because the fact they got a primary shows the kind of political weakness they're in versus the general election. So it's not a good sign.\\n\\nKELLY: Although, is there maybe some advantage to the party to challenging a sitting president, even if the contender doesn't ultimately succeed? It helps sharpen the party's message going into a general election.\\n\\nMURPHY: Well, it does litigate what a party ought to be. And if the party is on a path of complete political failure - and I think in the Trump era, some - I would be one of them - would argue moral failure - then you got to have the fight to figure out what you are for the future, even if the immediate election is, you know, not the happy result. So long-term, maybe you need it.\\n\\nKELLY: You said you believe we're - are in a different era now. So let me ask you, does conventional wisdom apply in 2019 going into 2020? The Trump presidency is uncharted waters in so many ways.\\n\\nMURPHY: Yeah. No, look, we have never had a reality-show president before. And you don't know if it's cyclical, and things will revert to mean, or this is the new normal. That - that's the open question that's going to get litigated. My guess is the future's a bit of a mix. I think there will be a rotation away from Trump towards something a little more normal, a little more grown-up. But, you know, at this point, that's only a guess.\\n\\nKELLY: If someone were to consider throwing their hat into the Republican primary ring, is there a better time to do it? Is it best to get in there early?\\n\\nMURPHY: No, I actually believe that early is a mistake. This is all predicated on the president hitting even more trouble within the party after more political failure. That requires time if that's going to happen. So I think the idea of being early gives you any big advantage is not true.\\n\\nIt's much more about maybe Labor Day, you know, at the end of this year where the president is and is there an opening then. I think the early strategy is not appropriate in a situation where you're trying to deal with what could be a political collapse of an incumbent president in your party.\\n\\nKELLY: I mean, it's something hearing you, a Republican strategist, saying that, talking about potential collapse of the party. Do you really think that the field is not open, in the few seconds we have left, to somebody challenging him?\\n\\nMURPHY: Oh, I think it's theoretically open. But the reality of the president's strength at the end of the year is yet to be determined. He's definitely on a declining path, though, after the midterms.\\n\\nKELLY: Republican political consultant Mike Murphy, thanks so much.\\n\\nMURPHY: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "Twitter Locks Trump's Account, Warns Of 'Permanent Suspension' If Violations Continue\\n\\ntoggle caption Twitter.com\\n\\nTwitter on Wednesday put President Trump on notice: If he does not stop breaking the platform's rules, he will be permanently banned.\\n\\nThe stern warning followed another step never before taken by Twitter: It locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours after the removal of three tweets that the company said were a severe violation of Twitter's rules.\\n\\nOnce Trump's time-out expires on Twitter, the company said it may boot the president off the platform for good if his sharing of election-relation disinformation and glorifications of violence continue.\\n\\nFacebook deleted the same video Twitter acted on and blocked Trump's account from sharing messages for 24 hours, but the social network did not say it was considering a permanent suspension of Trump.\\n\\nAmong the tweets that Twitter removed from public view was a video addressed to the mob that violently swarmed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. In the video, Trump said he loved those supporters, even as he told them to go home. He also fanned conspiracy theories that the presidential election was stolen from him.\\n\\nIn the two other tweets removed, Trump falsely suggested he had won the presidential election.\\n\\nTwitter, taking the boldest enforcement action to date against Trump, has faced months of accusations that it has not done enough to limit the spread of Trump's groundless attacks on the democratic election he lost and incitements of violence sent to his millions of followers.\\n\\nThe social media platform has slapped warning labels on dozens of Trump's tweets to limit the spread, in addition to other steps taken to prevent Trump messages laced with falsehoods from going viral. But many onlookers say Twitter has been ineffective in curbing the reach of Trump's misleading and incendiary material.\\n\\nAs someone who has served on your Trust and Safety Board since its inception and counseled you since 2009, time is now to suspend President Trump's account, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia, in a tweet. He has deliberately incited violence, causing mayhem with his lies and threats.\\n\\nMany world leaders, including Trump, have enjoyed more freedom than ordinary users to share messages on Facebook and Twitter, since the platforms consider their comments political speech that has public value. Yet critics say that rule has enabled Trump to turn conspiracies viral, most recently Trump's repeated airing of baseless allegations about the November election.\\n\\nIn indicating that Trump could soon be banished from the platform, Twitter may be re-examining how that rule applies to Trump.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the melee on the Capitol drew calls from Democratic lawmakers and civil rights advocates for Trump to be kicked off Twitter and Facebook over a long pattern of abusing the platforms.\\n\\nTrump is inciting violence and spreading dangerous misinformation that is undermining our democracy and our way of life. Social media continues to amplify his anti-democratic rhetoric, said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., who added that Twitter and Facebook should remove Trump from their platforms.\\n\\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said the insurrection on the Capitol staged by some of Trump's most ardent supporters was the direct result of fear and disinformation that has been supercharged by social media companies.\\n\\nSocial media companies should suspend his accounts ASAP as they would do for anyone else advocating disinformation and promoting violence, Greenblatt said. It's time."}
{"original": "'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/AP Scott Eisen/AP\\n\\nAs Donald Trump has focused the messaging of his presidential campaign in recent weeks, he's centered on one key attack on Democrat Hillary Clinton: The suggestion that the Clinton Foundation was a pay-to-play front that enabled Hillary and Bill Clinton to trade government access and favors for money.\\n\\nIt's impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins, Trump said Tuesday night in Texas. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.\\n\\nBill and Hillary Clinton have defended the foundation's work under the intensifying attacks. We're trying to do good things, Bill Clinton said Wednesday. If there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, I don't know what it is. The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing. I have nothing to say about it except that I'm really proud.\\n\\nThe Clintons don't directly profit from the foundation, despite Trump's accusation. Neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton draws a salary from it, according to tax documents.\\n\\nThe Clinton Foundation very much mirrors former President Bill Clinton's public image. It is ambitious. It is sprawling and, at times, unfocused. Its practices raise many ethical red flags that political observers say could have easily been avoided. And yet it has also delivered concrete results in public policy fields as wide-ranging as lowering the price of HIV/AIDS medication in sub-Saharan Africa to combating childhood obesity.\\n\\nWhat, exactly, does the Clinton Foundation do?\\n\\nA lot.\\n\\nThe Clinton Foundation is where Bill Clinton focused his efforts after leaving office in 2001. Initially formed to raise funds for and build Clinton's presidential library, the foundation morphed into one of the world's most ambitious nonprofit organizations over the past 16 years.\\n\\nIt has shrunk, grown and been reorganized several times. In its present form, the foundation is a constellation of nine different initiatives and two affiliated entities, each focused on achieving a different public policy goal.\\n\\nThat includes lowering the cost of HIV/AIDS medication; addressing climate change; improving education in Haiti; and an annual conference that gathers heads of state, world leaders and celebrities to New York City, where they all make philanthropic promises.\\n\\nThe Clintons frequently point to the foundation's Health Access Initiatives, saying they have lowered the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment around the world, and helped deliver cheaper drugs to more than 9 million people. That's a claim PolitiFact rated as true.\\n\\nThe foundation is organized around the idea of convening and connecting. We believe that the best way to unlock human potential is through the power of creative collaboration, its website states. That's why we build partnerships between businesses, NGOs, governments and individuals everywhere to work faster, leaner and better.\\n\\nAs The New York Times explained it:\\n\\nInstead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.\\n\\nAll those programs require a whole lot of money. The foundation has raised more than $2 billion since 2001, according to The Washington Post.\\n\\nThe foundation also didn't used to be so polarizing. Plenty of Republicans have spoken at the Clinton Global Initiative, including Mitt Romney just 42 days before the 2012 election.\\n\\nSince serving as president, President Clinton has devoted himself to lifting people around the world, Romney said then. And one of the best things to happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate.\\n\\nEven Donald J. Trump gave between $100,001 and $250,000 to the foundation.\\n\\nSo what's the problem?\\n\\nThe problem is all that money — and whether donors were motivated by anything other than pure goodwill and philanthropy. Namely: whether they gave because of the promise of access to and favors from Hillary Clinton, who was just beginning her career in public office at the time that Bill Clinton had ended his.\\n\\nEvery former president has set up some sort of foundation and aggressively raised money to fund it. Only one former president — Bill Clinton — has been married to someone eyeing her own run for the White House.\\n\\nEmails released this month by conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch highlight several instances during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state where Clinton Foundation staffers contacted the State Department soliciting favors for people who had donated to the organization.\\n\\nHere's how The New York Times characterized one email conversation:\\n\\nIn April 2009, Douglas J. Band, who led the foundation's Clinton Global Initiative, emailed Ms. Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, another top adviser to Mrs. Clinton, for help with a donor. Mr. Band wrote that he needed to connect Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire who was one of the foundation's top donors, with someone at the State Department to talk about his interests in Lebanon.  'It's Jeff Feltman,' Ms. Abedin answered, referring to Jeffrey Feltman, who was the American ambassador to Lebanon at the time. 'I'm sure he knows him. I'll talk to Jeff.' Mr. Band asked her to call Mr. Chagoury immediately if possible. 'This is very important,' he wrote.\\n\\nIn another exchange that year, Band emailed Huma Abedin — a close Clinton aide who was working at the State Department at the time — to request that Clinton meet with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, whom he referred to as a good friend of ours.\\n\\nShe responded:\\n\\nFrom: Huma Abedin To: Doug Band Sent: Tue Jun 23 4:12:46 2009 Subject: Re: He asked to see hrc thurs and fri thru normal channels. I asked and she said she doesn't want to commit to anything for thurs or fri until she knows how she will feel. Also she says that she may want to go to ny and doesn't want to be committed to stuff in ny...\\n\\nAbedin then followed up, offering the crown prince a sitdown with Clinton. If u see him, let him know, she wrote Band. We have reached out through official channels.\\n\\nAt a 2005 Clinton Global Initiative event, Salman committed $32 million to youth scholarship programs. That wasn't a donation to the Clinton Foundation itself — just a promise to spend the money to help Bahraini students to take leadership roles in the private and public sectors.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Kingdom of Bahrain has donated more than $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation itself, according to the group's records.\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign has repeatedly denied that the Department of State took any action in response to contributions to the Clinton Foundation.\\n\\nWhat's this about Secretary Clinton meeting with foundation donors, though?\\n\\nRepublicans' attacks on the Clinton Foundation intensified this week after The Associated Press published an article claiming that more than half of the private citizens Clinton met with as secretary of state were foundation donors.\\n\\nIt's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president, the article stated.\\n\\nExcept that's not quite the full story. The AP ignored the thousands of meetings that Clinton held with government officials from the United States and other countries. Such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties, the news organization argued.\\n\\nClinton's campaign said that framing created an unfair picture. This story relies on utterly flawed data, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton foundation.\\n\\nFallon said there were more than 1,700 Clinton meetings that were not factored in.\\n\\nStill, no matter what the total percentage was, Clinton still sat down 40 people who had donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and 20 who had donated more than $1 million, according to the AP's tallies.\\n\\nThere's no question the optics are bad for Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. But no proof has emerged that any official favors — regulations, government contracts, international deals — were curried in exchange for donations or pledges.\\n\\nOne case that Clinton critics point to involves banking giant UBS, which was locked in a tense battle with the Internal Revenue Service when Clinton took office in 2009. The Wall Street Journal published a detailed look at Clinton's dealings with the bank:\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Service was suing UBS AG to get the identities of Americans with secret accounts. If the case proceeded, Switzerland's largest bank would face an impossible choice: Violate Swiss secrecy laws by handing over the names, or refuse and face criminal charges in U.S. federal court. Within months, Mrs. Clinton announced a tentative legal settlement — an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat. UBS ultimately turned over information on 4,450 accounts, a fraction of the 52,000 sought by the IRS, an outcome that drew criticism from some lawmakers who wanted a more extensive crackdown. From that point on, UBS's engagement with the Clinton family's charitable organization increased. Total donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation grew from less than $60,000 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the foundation and the bank.\\n\\nThe bank also paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million for a series of private speeches.\\n\\nBut it's not like the UBS standoff wasn't already a top diplomatic concern for Clinton. According to The Journal, it was the very first issue Switzerland's foreign minister brought up with Clinton when the two met in the early months of Clinton's tenure.\\n\\nSorting out the overlapping lines of the Clinton Foundation and the State Department are murky, because the types of people and groups who are apt to make major donations to a top-tier international nonprofit are the same types of people and groups who would seek out — and be granted — meetings with top State Department officials.\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign pointed this out in its response to the AP story. The AP included Melinda Gates, for example, in its tally of donors whom Clinton met with while at State.\\n\\nMelinda Gates is a world-renowned philanthropist whose foundations works to address global health crises and eradicate disease in the developing world, Fallon said in his statement. Meeting with someone like Melinda Gates is squarely in the purview of America's top diplomat, whose job involves confronting these game global challenges.\\n\\n'Unraveling' the foundation\\n\\nWhen Clinton joined the Obama administration, the Obama Transition Team put together a memorandum of understanding that aimed at unblurring the lines between Clinton's official duties at the State Department, and the work her family's foundation was carrying out in similar fields.\\n\\nThe foundation agreed to disclose its donors on an annual basis. It also spun off the Clinton Global Initiative — that annual confab of world leaders — and its HIV/AIDS Initiative into separate, but still related, entities. The foundation also agreed to inform the State Department of any foreign contributions.\\n\\nStill, it was hard to keep everything separate. Take the two Clinton staffers from those email exchanges: Doug Band and Huma Abedin. Toward the end of Clinton's tenure, Abedin sought and was granted special government employee status, which meant she could work part time for both the State Department and outside groups. She ended up doing work for the Clinton Foundation, as well as Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm run by Band.\\n\\nAnd while Band, a longtime aide to Bill Clinton, never worked for State, he also held multiple roles within the Clintons' orbit. As Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times recently explained it to NPR:\\n\\nHe is a personal assistant to Bill Clinton. He ran a consulting company that paid Bill Clinton a lot of money until 2012. He is also the head of Clinton's Global Initiative which gets together muckety mucks from all over the world for big charity events, and he's with the Clinton Foundation. So to figure out at any one time which hat someone like Doug Band is wearing when he communicates with aides to Hillary Clinton is a bit of a puzzle.\\n\\nThe Clinton Foundation recently announced changes that would take place if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Bill Clinton would step down from its board; the foundation would stop accepting foreign money; the Clinton Global Initiative would end after next month.\\n\\nAnd, NPR learned Tuesday, the foundation will work to spin off many of its international efforts.\\n\\nThe most important thing to the president and to Chelsea is that the work continues but under different umbrellas away from the foundation, obviously, because we will not be able to accept corporate donations or international money as we have to support our programs, foundation President Donna Shalala told NPR.\\n\\nThat announcement has not satisfied Trump and other Republicans, who are now calling — on a near-daily basis — for the Clintons to shut the entire foundation down."}
{"original": "Piecing Together America's Patchwork Quilt Of Body Cam Laws\\n\\nIt's increasingly likely that the next time you have an encounter with a police officer, he or she will be wearing a body camera. And depending on how things go, you may be left wondering: Can I get a copy of that video?\\n\\nThere's no single answer to that, or other pressing questions, such as whether you can tell an officer you don't want to be recorded. In the year and a half since the Ferguson, Mo., protests, police departments have been rushing to adopt the cameras.\\n\\nBut when it comes to body camera policies, departments are all over the map.\\n\\nThat's why you might want to consult these maps. Produced by the Urban Institute, they're state-by-state breakdowns of local laws governing the recording and releasing of these videos. Those laws aren't always clear — even to police departments.\\n\\nYou'll see individual law enforcement agencies that are developing policies that may or may not even align with state statute, says Nancy La Vigne, director of the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center. She says she and her staff created the interactive feature in part to help local police figure out how body cameras fit into their state's laws.\\n\\nThe maps show considerable variation on how states balance privacy and the public's right to know, but there is near-unanimity on one point: Police can usually withhold videos, at least temporarily, to protect pending investigations, or for other public safety reasons.\\n\\nAnother thing you'll notice about the maps is a lot of yellow — denoting proposed legislation. States have been scrambling to draw up new laws specific to body cameras. Many are grappling with unforeseen consequences.\\n\\nA good example is Washington, a state where a permissive public records law — you can easily request almost any government document — has combined with relatively strict privacy laws to create a huge logistical headache for police.\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I reported on a public records advocate who requested every dash cam video produced by the Seattle Police Department, and was planning to make a similar request once the department adopted body cams. SPD responded by experimenting with automatic disclosure — releasing the videos straight to YouTube.\\n\\nBut to comply with privacy rules, the department also blurred key details and removed the audio, a solution that didn't really satisfy those calling for greater transparency.\\n\\nSo now, because of body cams, the Washington Legislature may end up curbing the state's open records law. The state House has passed a bill that would make broad, give-me-everything-style requests harder, by forcing a requester to specify incidents and pay for the cost of redacting private details from the videos.\\n\\nLa Vigne says similar legislative scrambling is happening around the country.\\n\\nWe're seeing that the use of the technology is well ahead of the policy development, and that's creating real challenges and problems, La Vigne says.\\n\\nAnd states are coming up with very different solutions. There's nothing like a national consensus on what the rules should be for recording and public access — no clear set of nationally accepted body camera rights that you might eventually see written into the scripts of police procedurals on TV.\\n\\nI don't see that changing anytime soon, La Vigne says. State rights govern supreme, so I don't see any movement toward a common definition of these very thorny issues.\\n\\nSo your best bet, the next time you're wondering about that police video of you, is to consult the Urban Institute's maps. But do it soon, because its research was current up to January 2016, and the laws are still very much in flux."}

Tacos are life. #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner pic.twitter.com/QCthBHRiDn — Trevor Donovan (@TrevDon) September 2, 2016\\n\\nThursday night in an appearance on MSNBC, Donald Trump surrogate Marco Gutierrez warned of impending taco overlords if immigration continues unchecked.\\n\\nGutierrez, who was born in Mexico and is co-founder of Latinos for Trump, said to MSNBC, My culture is a very dominant culture. It is imposing and it's causing problems.\\n\\nThen he said the line that started a hashtag: If you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks [on] every corner.\\n\\nCue the memes.\\n\\nHe went on to say that Mexicans have a lot of good things we're bringing to the United States, but we also have problems.\\n\\nIn an interview in late July with NPR's Asma Khalid at the Republican National Convention, Gutierrez said he was born and raised in Mexico, moved to the U.S. in 1991, and that his parents, who were farm workers, came here as braceros. They worked in the fields. So, they got amnesty ... in 1986, through the Reagan amnesty.\\n\\nGutierrez's comments came the night after Trump gave a forceful speech outlining his immigration policy — including hiring 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and tripling the number of deportation officers.\\n\\nMost of them pointed out that, for a lot of Americans, taco trucks aren't a bad thing at all.

As MSNBC, the Huffington Post and others have reported, for months now, Trump surrogates have either offered remarks that directly contradict Donald Trump's message, or made gaffes that have become distractions for the campaign. Many have downplayed Trump's rhetoric on a border wall with Mexico, with one even calling it virtual, and Trump's plan to deport 11 million immigrants rhetorical, according to MSNBC. Another Trump surrogate, Huffington Post reported, suggested that Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. And just this week, Trump surrogate Mark Burns tweeted a cartoon image of Hillary Clinton in blackface.\\n\\nTrump's surrogate problems got so bad that last month, as The Hill reported, the Trump campaign sent out a memo asking them to review and use the attached talking points in your daily messaging, including a release and/or statements you can put out in your social media immediately to support Mr. Trump and OUR message.\\n\\nBut, to be clear, filling American voters' heads with dreams of taco trucks on every corner isn't the worst thing a surrogate could do, so maybe Trump should just let all his surrogates be."}
{"original": "Supreme Court Rules On Cross-Border Justice, Debates Free Speech On Immigration\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\nImmigration and Border Patrol issues took center stage at the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases on Tuesday.\\n\\nA sharply divided court first ruled that the parents of a Mexican boy fatally shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent cannot sue the officer who killed their son. Then, the court heard arguments in a free-speech case that will determine whether people who encourage illegal immigrants to remain in the country can be prosecuted.\\n\\nBorder Patrol shooting\\n\\nIn 2010, 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez and his friends were playing chicken at the U.S. Mexican border, running up and touching the border fence, and then running away and hiding. Video of the scene shows Sergio peeking out from behind a railroad trestle on the Mexico side, as Agent Jesus Mesa Jr. points a gun, fires and kills the boy.\\n\\nWhen the U.S. government declined to prosecute the agent or turn him over to Mexican authorities to face murder charges there, the boy's parents sued the agent for damages, contending that he violated the U.S. Constitution by depriving Hernandez of his life.\\n\\nThe suit was brought under a 1971 Supreme Court ruling that allowed such damage claims against officers who act in bad faith.\\n\\nThe panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that no reasonable officer would have done what Mesa did under the circumstances, but the full appeals court said that it didn't matter whether Mesa had acted unreasonably, his parents couldn't sue because Hernandez was standing on the Mexican side of the border when he was shot.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court threw out the suit entirely and went much further, cutting the heart out of much of the court's 1971 decision.\\n\\nThe vote was 5 to 4, with the court's conservative justices refusing to allow damage suits for cross-border shootings and the court's liberal justices castigating the court's majority for giving a free pass to the rogue actions of law enforcement officers.\\n\\nWriting for the conservative court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that in essence, the court has come to realize the folly of its earlier decision and has thus sought to limit its effect.\\n\\nA federal court's authority to recognize a damages remedy must rest at bottom on a statute enacted by Congress, he wrote, and no statute expressly creates [such] a remedy.\\n\\nAlito said there is a world of difference between allowing damage claims that have been allowed in the past and a case like this one, in which, Alito maintained, there were foreign policy and national security issues at stake. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, would have gone further and outright overturned the court's 1971 decision and others that followed in its wake.\\n\\nWriting for the dissenters, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that using lethal force against a person who poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others surely qualifies as an unreasonable invasion of an individual's constitutional rights. It should not matter one whit that the boy was standing on the Mexican side of the embankment, not the U.S. side, she added.\\n\\nMexico perceives cross-border shootings like this one to be a persistent problem. The Mexican government, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, cited U.S. Customs and Border Protection's own statistics showing that its officers reported use of deadly force involving firearms over 200 times through October 2018, with nearly all of the deadly shootings near the U.S.-Mexico border, and many killings that involved shots fired across the border.\\n\\nA separate investigation conducted by the Arizona Republic revealed that border patrol agents and CBP officers killed at least 42 people, all but four of whom were killed along or near the Southwest border between 2005 and 2013.\\n\\nRobert Hilliard, who represents the Hernandez family, was more than disappointed by the ruling, telling NPR that the path to justice apparently does not travel as far as a bullet.\\n\\nThe First Amendment and immigration advocacy\\n\\nAfter the announcement of the ruling in the Hernandez case, the Supreme Court moved on to hearing arguments in another immigration case, but this one involved the First Amendment right of free speech.\\n\\nAt issue was a statute that makes it a crime to encourage or advise immigrants in the country illegally to stay. Critics say the law could ensnare grandparents, ministers, lawyers and human rights activists.\\n\\nThe case involves the conviction of Evelyn Sineneng-Smith, a California woman who ran an immigration consulting business that mainly served Filipino home health care workers.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2008, she collected more than $3 million from clients applying for an adjustment of their immigration status. The adjustment program, however, had ended in 2001, so the clients she applied for were not actually eligible.\\n\\nSineneng-Smith was subsequently convicted of mail fraud, tax violations and of illegally encouraging or inducing an alien to remain in the U.S.\\n\\nIt was this last conviction — for encouraging undocumented people to stay in the U.S. — that was before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that conviction, finding it to be a violation of the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. Both liberal and conservative advocacy groups have urged the Supreme Court to follow suit, contending that the statute is so broad that it encompasses lots of perfectly legal expression.\\n\\nAssistant Solicitor General Eric Feigin, representing the Trump administration, took incoming fire from an ideologically diverse set of justices.\\n\\nWhat about a grandmother whose granddaughter is in the United States illegally and tells [her] granddaughter ... 'I hope you will stay'? asked Chief Justice John Roberts. Would that grandmother be at risk of federal prosecution?\\n\\nWhat about a charity? followed up Justice Brett Kavanaugh. If it's a charity that provides food to someone who's in the country unlawfully ... is it covered under the statute?\\n\\nFeigin acknowledged that it was possible conduct of that sort might violate the statute but added that there was no instance of it actually being used in that way.\\n\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor followed up: It has been used to create a watchlist at the border for charitable organizations, people who were giving legal advice at the border ... because they potentially violated this encouragement provision. And, noted Sotomayor, there was a prosecution in the case of a woman who advised her housekeeper that if you return to your home country, you may not get back.\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch noted that being in the country illegally is not itself a crime, so why is encouraging someone to stay a crime?\\n\\nArguing on behalf of Sineneng-Smith, the defendant in the case, lawyer Mark Fleming faced a grilling from Alito who wanted to know whether there is any kind of encouraging speech that could be criminalized.\\n\\nFor instance, what if a bullied and depressed teenager calls up a friend to say he is going to kill himself, and the friend says, I'm tired of hearing this from you ... you're a coward, why don't you just do it ... pull the trigger?\\n\\nAsked Alito, Is that speech protected by the First Amendment?\\n\\nNo, replied Fleming, because that is inciting imminent harm, which the Supreme Court has said is not protected.\\n\\nAddressing the government's argument that the statute is not really used to prosecute most speech, Fleming told the justices that while the statute has historically not been used much, the Trump administration has recently made it a focus of enforcement.\\n\\nBuilding on Sotomayor's point about government watchlists of charitable organizations and lawyers working at the border, Fleming noted that should the court uphold the law, it could soon be used against U.S. citizens for their prayer, for their speech, and for their legal advice.\\n\\nA decision in the case is expected by summer."}
{"original": "CHART: Who Wins, Who Loses With Senate Health Care Bill\\n\\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nSenate Republicans on Thursday unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. The long-awaited plan marks a big step toward achieving one of the Republican Party's major goals.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nThe Senate proposal is broadly similar to the bill passed by House Republicans last month, with a few notable differences. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been criticized for drafting the bill in secret with just a dozen Republican Senate colleagues, says the proposal — which he calls a discussion draft — will stabilize insurance markets, strengthen Medicaid and cut costs to consumers.\\n\\nWe agreed on the need to free Americans from Obamacare's mandates. And policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandates so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don't need or can't afford, McConnell said.\\n\\nInstead, the bill entices people to voluntarily buy a policy by offering them tax credits based on age and income to help pay premiums.\\n\\nThis bill is better designed than the House version, according to Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, because it offers more help to older people who can't afford insurance while making coverage cheaper for young healthy people.\\n\\nThe bill will encourage a lot more of those individuals to buy health insurance, Roy says. That, in turn, will make the risk pool much healthier, which will also lower premiums. And the tax credits in the bill will also be better-designed.\\n\\nBut Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says the bill bases its tax credits on lower-quality insurance.If you're paying a similar percentage of income, you're getting a less generous product under this new plan, she says.\\n\\nThe plan keeps some popular parts of Obamacare. It allows parents keep their children on their policies until age 26 and requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\\n\\nBut it then allows states to opt out of that requirement.\\n\\nThe protections around pre-existing conditions are still in place in the Senate bill, but the waiver authority gives states options that could include limiting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, says Pearson.\\n\\nThose waivers would allow state to drop benefits required by Obamacare, such as maternity coverage, mental health care and prescription drug coverage.\\n\\nBoth bills would eliminate most of the taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nAnd they would bar people from using tax credits to buy policies that pay for abortion and also block Planned Parenthood from getting any money from Medicaid for a year.\\n\\nPerhaps the most sweeping move, however, is that the Senate plan follows the House lead in completely changing how the government pays for health care for the poor and the disabled — and goes even further.\\n\\nToday, Medicaid pays for all the care people need, and state and federal governments share the cost.\\n\\nBut Medicaid has been eating up an ever-larger share of federal spending. The Senate Republicans' plan puts a lid on that by rolling back the Obama-era expansion of the program and then granting states a set amount of money for each person enrolled. Republicans also want to change the way the federal government calculates payments to the states starting in 2025, reducing the federal government's contribution to the states.\\n\\nThe Medicaid cuts are even more draconian that the House bill was, though they take effect more gradually than the House bill did, Pearson says. So we're going to see very significant reductions in coverage in Medicaid and big cuts in federal funding that will result in significant budget gaps for states.\\n\\nSeveral Republican senators have already said they oppose the bill, at least as of now. Senate leaders are aiming for a vote before July 4."}
{"original": "Crow Murders In Idaho Are Nothing To Squawk About: Human Scarecrows Try To Divert Bird Invasion\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Winfried Rothermel/AP Winfried Rothermel/AP\\n\\nEvery winter for the past three years, almost 10,000 migratory crows have descended upon Nampa, Idaho, dotting the skyline in black and squawking away.\\n\\nBy day the birds scavenge for food in farmland that surrounds Nampa. By night they flock to the city to roost — gathering in large groups to sleep — on power lines and in grocery store parking lots.\\n\\nMore than just the eerie sense of dread out of an Edgar Allen Poe poem, city officials say the birds, known collectively as a murder, are creating a public health hazard, due to their droppings. Sometimes tree branches snap under their combined weight.\\n\\nThe city has asked for volunteers to help manage the annual crow invasion. A team of human scarecrows deploy non-lethal methods to try to divert the crows away from the town, says Bobby Sanchez, chief of staff for the city of Nampa, who leads the volunteer efforts.\\n\\nThe health hazard is the result of the mess that they produce, he tells Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd. The trees that they roost in, they can break branches, and the buildings that they roost on top of, they can cause structural damage.\\n\\nThe Crow Management Task Force uses methods that scare the birds away without hurting them, Sanchez says. Drones, infrared lasers, which crows read as sticks flying through the air, and real predators like a live hawk are used to intimidate crows.\\n\\nBut when the birds first arrived in Nampa two years ago, it was an all-out war; former Mayor Bob Henry authorized police officers to shoot the crows.\\n\\nIt's a dilemma, Henry said in a news release at the time, according to the Idaho Statesman. At what point should taxpayer dollars be used to fight the crows? By doing nothing, the crow murders in the city, particularly in the downtown area, create a daily mess and can potentially cause health hazards.\\n\\nBut when the new mayor, Debbie Kling, took office in January 2018, she reversed the policy and encouraged non-lethal methods, after animal rights groups argued that shooting crows violated the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a 1918 law that sought to protect bird species that were almost extinct.\\n\\nBirds in the crow family are known as incredibly smart creatures; they remember faces and have been known to give gifts to humans that feed them. In France, officials at a theme park trained a group of rooks, a type of crow, to pick up small pieces of trash and cigarette butts in exchange for food.\\n\\nWhile they work to drive crows away, members of the Nampa task force are also trying to understand what brought the crows to their town in the first place, Sanchez says.\\n\\nOur assumption is that they're are attracted here because it provides this kind of hybrid of natural and man-made habitat along with food sources, he says. Ultimately, the end game will be to answer another question [which] is can we construct perhaps a habitat that is equally desirable by the crows? And then over time move them to that location, where they can literally roost in peace."}
{"original": "Trump's Defense Department Pick Threatens Civilian Control Of Military\\n\\nTrump's included generals in his appointments for cabinet positions typically held by civilians. Tom Ricks of the New America Foundation tells Scott Simon about how that could affect policy decisions.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nDonald Trump said during his campaign for president that he knew more than the generals, but he sure included a lot of generals in his Cabinet-level appointments - General James Mattis for secretary of defense, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for national security adviser and he's considering General David Petraeus for the State Department. Tom Ricks wrote a book called The Generals. He is the national security adviser at the New America foundation and joins us now. Thanks very much for being with us.\\n\\nTOM RICKS: You're welcome.\\n\\nSIMON: Generals often know a lot, don't they? Why not make use of that?\\n\\nRICKS: They do know a lot, but I think it's important to make a distinction here that Trump is not just randomly picking generals. He's picking a particular subclass of generals, which is those who got in hot water with the Obama administration. Mattis, Petraeus and Flynn all were ousted from their positions by the administration for various reasons.\\n\\nSIMON: And you think as a generalization they might be bad ideas for positions now.\\n\\nRICKS: No. I think that their getting crosswise with Obama effectively became a recommendation for Trump to talk to them. He sees them as distinguished because they stood up to the Obama administration. But they're a very different group of people - different personalities, different backgrounds, different approaches. I actually think General Mattis will make a good secretary of defense. I have some qualms about having a former general in that position. We've only had one, but of all the people out there, I think Mattis is a very good choice for that position running the Pentagon.\\n\\nSIMON: What are your qualms about a general in that position?\\n\\nRICKS: It's against the American tradition to have a general running our military. It is seen as a threat to civilian control of the military. That said, I think Donald Trump is a far bigger threat to this country than James Mattis ever would be. I think Trump acts on impulse, on what pleases the crowd and on his gut feelings and doesn't know much about the big world out there. And that's a very dangerous combination to have as president. By contrast, Jim Mattis is a thoughtful, well-read, well-educated, disciplined, strategic thinker who knows a lot about the world and especially about the Middle East where he spent several years fighting and serving as a military commander.\\n\\nSIMON: General Mattis would need to be confirmed by Congress, of course, and they would have to waive the rule that requires the secretary of defense to be out of active duty for seven years.\\n\\nRICKS: That's right. Remember, it's not an outright ban on having former generals become secretary of defense. It's more a hurdle put in the way, I think, by Congress back in the 1940s just to say, hold on a second, think about this. Let's not make it quite so easy for a fresh general, newly retired, to become secretary of defense. But they didn't say don't do it at all. They just said here's something that's going to make you think about it before you do it.\\n\\nSIMON: What about the fact that Donald Trump seemed to campaign on a foreign policy platform of disengagement from the world, if you please, and General Mattis has talked about what he calls continued American engagement in the world?\\n\\nRICKS: Mattis does believe in American engagement and American leadership. But I think you're pointing to a fundamental contradiction in the Trump administration. There are people around him with views on, say, example, Russia, everything from embracing Putin to believing that Russia is an aggressive and dangerous country. These people are really going to have some initial problems in sorting out what their policy is. I think it's going to be interesting to watch. I think it's going to be a very unstable and unsettling time. Again, that's a reason I think that somebody like Mattis who knows this stuff and is willing to speak clearly about it will be a good person to have talking to the president and educating probably the most ignorant president we've ever had, at least in modern times.\\n\\nSIMON: Tom Ricks of the New America foundation, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nRICKS: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

{"original": "Bernie Sanders Seals A Super Saturday With 3 State Wins\\n\\nThe Vermont senator easily clinched wins over Clinton in Washington state, Hawaii and Alaska. Meanwhile, mud-slinging among the Republican candidates continues.\\n\\nLINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:\\n\\nThis is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. Rachel Martin is off this Easter Sunday. I'm Linda Wertheimer. The presidential primary is grinding on. Yesterday, there were Democratic caucuses in Washington state, Hawaii and Alaska, and Bernie Sanders swept them handily. Next on the calendar for both parties is Wisconsin's primary on April 5. NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, is here now with results and a look ahead. Good morning, Mara.\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Linda.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: So Bernie Sanders took those Western some very - Western caucuses by percentages well into the double digits. What does that mean for the race?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, it was a very big day for Sanders. He won the caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and the big prize of Washington state. Because the Democrats award delegates proportionately, not winner-take-all, Hillary Clinton did come out with some delegates, too. She still has a big delegate lead, close to 300 pledged delegates.\\n\\nBut Sanders now has renewed momentum going into Wisconsin, which should be a good state for him - lots of white liberals there. And New York is coming up, and he's planning to campaign very aggressively against Clinton in her home state, planning to talk about her ties to Wall Street.\\n\\nSo right now Bernie Sanders needs close to 60 percent of all the remaining delegates to catch up to Clinton, so he has to win almost all of the remaining contests and win them by very large margins.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: Which is a tall order, I think.\\n\\nLIASSON: That's right.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: Republicans did not vote this week but oh boy, that did not mean there wasn't news or what's passing for news in this season. I want to present an interesting contrast for the week - two voices, starting with the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, on Wednesday on Capitol Hill.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nCONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN: This has always been a tough business, and when passions flare ugliness is sometimes inevitable. But we shouldn't accept ugliness as the norm.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that'll do it every time. Donald, you're a sniveling coward, and leave Heidi the hell alone.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: And of course, that second voice was Ted Cruz in Wisconsin the very next day, engaging in some ugliness with Donald Trump.\\n\\nLIASSON: That's right. That contrast was pretty stark, Paul Ryan complaining about identity politics without naming Donald Trump. Ryan says he wants the Republican Party to be a party of ideas, not insults. He's complained before about Trump's rhetoric - about his inciting violence at rallies, for not quickly repudiating support from the KKK - but it hasn't really made much of a difference.\\n\\nAnd as you just said, right after that speech Trump and Cruz got into the gutter again with a fight over each other's wives and what one tabloid is calling the Cuban Mistress Crisis. Ted Cruz responded to a National Enquirer report of alleged affairs saying they were untrue. He accused Donald Trump of being behind them, and Trump denied any involvement.\\n\\nSo when Republican leaders in Congress say they want to separate their candidates for House and Senate from Trump if he is the nominee, you can see that that is going to be very, very difficult.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: So what is happening in the voting part at the Republican primary as opposed to the Twitter and tabloid part of the Republican primary?\\n\\nLIASSON: Wisconsin is up next. That should be a good state for Trump, although it's also full of anti-Trump partisans like Speaker Ryan himself. We're also waiting to see if Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race, endorses Ted Cruz. But the Stop Trump forces are busy planning for a contested convention in which delegates would be freed up after the first ballot if Trump doesn't get 1,237 delegates.\\n\\nThey'd be free to vote their consciences. They would no longer have to abide by the results of their state's primaries, so both Trump and Cruz are trying to line up commitments from these delegates, who are living, breathing people with free will - at least after the first ballot. So it's really a shadow campaign.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: Now in a normal election year, having a big international event like the attack we saw in Brussels on Tuesday, that would've been top political news in this country also. Was it?\\n\\nLIASSON: It was out there. Usually terrorism helps the most talkish (ph) candidates, but it's unclear whether that will happen this year. Ted Cruz talked about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods. Trump gave big foreign-policy interviews to The New York Times and Washington Post talking about perhaps pulling back from NATO. Hillary Clinton gave a big national security speech at Stanford the day after the attacks, where she blasted Cruz and Trump and talked about how it's important to have steady hands to handle national security.\\n\\nWERTHEIMER: NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you very much.\\n\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Some Dementia Patients Increasingly Given Antipsychotics, Study Finds\\n\\nEnlarge this image Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP\\n\\nA new study from the AARP Public Policy Institute finds that dementia patients living at home or in assisted living facilities are increasingly being given antipsychotic drugs. This is despite the fact that antipsychotics are not approved to treat dementia. They're intended to treat serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In fact, the drugs carry what's known as a black box warning that antipsychotic drug use by older dementia patients can increase the risk of death.\\n\\nThe study used data from Medicare Advantage plans from 2012 to 2015. At the beginning of the study, 12.6 percent of dementia patients living at home or in assisted living had prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs. However, by the end of the AARP's study period, 13.4 percent of dementia patients living at home or in assisted living had prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs. This is an increase of more than 6 percent.\\n\\nThis runs counter to the trend in nursing homes, where the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs for dementia patients has declined by more than a third. This was largely due to a federal government campaign to reduce the use of the drugs in skilled nursing facilities. At 15.4 percent, there's still a higher rate of antipsychotic use on dementia patients in nursing homes than outside of them. The federal government tracks each nursing home's rate of antipsychotic use and makes that information publicly available on the website Nursing Home Compare. The GAO has recommended that the federal government pay more attention to reducing the use of antipsychotic drugs among all dementia patients, not just those in nursing homes."}
{"original": "Trump To Meet With Mexican President Ahead Of Immigration Speech\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP\\n\\nHours before he is slated to make a major policy speech on immigration Wednesday in Phoenix, Donald Trump is making a bold move — he will be meeting with Mexico's president.\\n\\nHe tweeted the news late Tuesday night:\\n\\nI have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016\\n\\nI have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Peña Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.\\n\\nThe Washington Post first reported that Trump was considering the move and could be flying to Mexico City to meet with Peña Nieto:\\n\\nMexican President Enrique 'Peña Nieto invited both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to visit Mexico last Friday, his office said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Tuesday night. Although no meetings have been confirmed, the statement said, both campaigns received the invitations 'on good terms.' Trump, sensing an opportunity, decided over the weekend to accept the invitation and push for a visit this week, according to the people familiar with the discussions.' \\n\\nPeña Nieto's office tweeted the following, translated into English:\\n\\nMr. Donald Trump has accepted the invitation to meet tomorrow in private with President Peña Nieto.\\n\\nEl Señor @realDonaldTrump ha aceptado esta invitación y se reunirá mañana en privado con el Presidente @EPN. — Presidencia México (@PresidenciaMX) August 31, 2016\\n\\nPeña Nieto's office told CNN earlier Tuesday night that the Mexican president sent invitations to both campaigns last Friday, which were well received by both of the teams' campaigns.\\n\\nTrump may hope the move makes him look strong and presidential, laying out his immigration plan directly to the Mexican president before addressing an American audience.\\n\\nBut the move also carries tremendous risk. Peña Nieto has been hotly critical of Trump's rhetoric, likening him to Mussolini and Hitler earlier this year. What's more, Peña Nieto has domestic politics to manage. His approval rating has plummeted amid scandal over the past several months, dropping to a record low 23 percent in August. Almost three-quarters of Mexicans are dissatisfied with the direction of the country.\\n\\nSo Peña Nieto might not exactly be bringing Trump in for a simple grip-and-grin handshake. Foreign trips have also been problematic for recent Republican presidential candidates. Mitt Romney, for example, criticized the preparations for the 2012 London Olympics, which landed him on the front page of one British newspaper as Mitt the Twit.\\n\\nThe logistics of such a move make a trip like this exceedingly difficult, as the Post notes:\\n\\nThe people informed of Trump's plans spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the matter. They said late Tuesday that talks between the Trump campaign and Mexican officials were ongoing, with Trump interested in going but logistics and security concerns still being sorted out.\\n\\nTrump has faced criticism over the past 10 days as he has vacillated on his position on immigration, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported:\\n\\nAn immigration policy centered around extreme positions — mass deportation of 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, plus building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — initially helped Trump stand out in the massive Republican primary field. So it was a surprise when, last week, the Trump campaign seemed to change direction, indicating that he was open to 'softening' his immigration position, and even at one point that he might be open to a path to legalization for some of those immigrants.\\n\\nIt's unclear at this point what exactly Trump will lay out Wednesday or what he would do with the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Immigration became a central issue in Trump's campaign on the day he announced his run for the presidency. He charged that immigrants coming to the U.S. illegally were bringing drugs, that they were rapists and that some, he assumed, were good people.\\n\\nThat, and Trump's overall tone throughout the primary campaign, launched a hot backlash from Latinos across the country, within his own party and abroad. Protesters brandished Trump piñatas, and Mexican presidents, current and former, vowed no way would Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S.'s southern border.\\n\\nPeña Nieto went so far as to compare Trump to dictators, like Italy's Benito Mussolini and Germany's Adolf Hitler.\\n\\nThere have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity, Peña Nieto told Excelsior, a daily newspaper in Mexico City. That's how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in — they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis. And I think what (they) put forward ended up at what we know today from history, in global conflagration. We don't want that happening anywhere in the world.\\n\\nNone of the criticism seemed to faze Trump. He threatened a trade war with the country and floated the idea of seizing remittances from Mexican immigrants in the U.S. to help pay for the wall. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump took to Twitter to show off that he was eating a taco bowl for lunch and wrote, The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!\\n\\nHappy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016\\n\\nThat set off a new round of controversy. But as polls have shown Hillary Clinton with a consistent lead post-convention, his new campaign team has urged a change in tone, if not policy. Gone is Trump's idea of a deportation force, which he proposed in November last year. He later told NBC's Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants would have to be sent back with their families to their parents' countries of origin.\\n\\nTrump has said over the past week and a half that there would be no citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally and no path to legalization without people leaving the country. Trump supporters in a meeting with him Aug. 20 said he talked about the potential for work visas and touch backs, people leaving the country or going to consulates and embassies to file paperwork."}
{"original": "Why Some Georgia Voters Split Their Ballots Between Democrats And Republicans\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\\n\\nTwo Democrats in Georgia won the state's U.S. Senate runoffs this week — a stunning upset after nearly two decades of Republican control that also handed Democrats a narrow majority in the Senate.\\n\\nBut even though both parties ran their candidates as one ticket, nearly 20,000 Georgians so far appear to have split their tickets in the two races, between Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock and Republican Sen. David Perdue.\\n\\nIt didn't seem like there was a lot of daylight in terms of policy in terms of their stances on [President] Trump, in terms of what they do for Georgia between David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, said Bernard Fraga, a political scientist at Emory University. So the fact that a relatively small number of Republican voters were willing to vote for David Perdue but not Kelly Loeffler is an interesting phenomenon.\\n\\nNathan Muller is one of these Georgians who saw daylight between the candidates where campaign strategists designed there to be none.\\n\\nThe software engineer from Smyrna, Ga., was raised Republican and believes in conservative principles but has voted split ticket in the past. In this runoff, maintaining divided government in Washington was a priority.\\n\\nI was not comfortable with Democrats having 100% control of the policymaking direction of this nation, he said. However, as someone who is not a fan of Trump, he found both candidates objectionable given how they tied their campaigns so closely to the president.\\n\\nPerdue ultimately stood out as more of a known quantity, Muller said.\\n\\nHe's more of a politician, meaning that if Trump fell out of power, but [Perdue] didn't, he would kind of fall back from the Trumpism. I think he was just trying to get elected, so to speak.\\n\\nLoeffler, on the other hand, did not seem that way, Muller said.\\n\\nShe did not seem like she was just trying to get elected. She actually seemed like she believed all those things and was in the Marjorie Taylor Greene-wing of the party, which I could not abide.\\n\\nLoeffler sought the endorsement of Greene, one of Georgia's newest congresswomen who has attracted much controversy for her Islamophobic remarks and espousal of conspiracy theories.\\n\\nMuller thinks there are other voters like him, who have turned against Republicans because of what the president has done to the party.\\n\\nThere's got to be a wholesale rejection of Trumpism to get these voters back, he said. Otherwise, they're either going to keep sitting on the sidelines or keep voting for Democrats like I did.\\n\\n[Loeffler's] messaging was just so, you know, bang, bang, bang the drum for Trump. 'More conservative than Attila the Hun' ... Like, are you nuts? Muller said, referring to a series of ads the Loeffler campaign released, which featured an actor dressed up as the barbaric ruler from the 400s.\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nThat ad also cost Loeffler Matthew Mutnick's vote. He's another Perdue-Warnock voter, who works in finance in Atlanta.\\n\\nMutnick had planned to vote for Loeffler when she was appointed more than a year ago. I thought that she was going to be moderate, he said, citing her business background running a company that created the first regulated cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nAnd she just went so far to the right that it was unrecognizable to who she was maybe even a year ago.\\n\\nHe said Warnock, a Black pastor, also felt more relatable to the average Georgian.\\n\\nLoeffler campaigned to the right because of an early challenge from Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, pointed out Martha Zoller, a conservative talk show host from Gainesville and prominent Loeffler supporter.\\n\\nBecause of Doug Collins being in the race initially, she had to go much farther right than I think she probably would have gone had he not been in the race, she said. I think we need to look at that going forward on what the impact of that was, and I think we still don't know.\\n\\nWhile their number wouldn't have made up the vote margin, Zoller said, these split-ticket voters are important for Republicans to keep in mind going forward.\\n\\nIt's a swing state now. You can't just focus on your base, she said. You've got to get your base out, no doubt about it. But you've got to understand that it's basically 50/50.\\n\\nWil Stowers, a consultant who grew up in a conservative home in Kennesaw, splits his time between Georgia and California and normally splits his ticket. In 2018, for example, he voted for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and then Republicans down the ballot.\\n\\nIn this runoff, he said he knew he would be proud to have Warnock represent him in the Senate and felt that he understood Warnock's vision. I understood what mattered to him, what he was actually running on, Stowers said. That was always clear to me. He wasn't running to be, you know, an ally of anybody. He was running to be a senator from Georgia.\\n\\nBut for Loeffler, he said, there was no indication in a post-President Trump world, what kind of representative she would be. We had two years of Senator Perdue before President Trump. I knew what that was. I knew what that looked like.\\n\\nStowers wasn't exactly excited about voting for Perdue, but he said Ossoff's campaign also didn't resonate with him.\\n\\nI wasn't sure why he wanted to be a senator, why he wanted to represent the state of Georgia, Stowers said.\\n\\n[Ossoff] really did come across as this articulate, 30-something-year-old white guy who wanted to be a senator. And I guess, maybe that was successful political labeling — it worked.\\n\\nKoddi Lester Dunn works in marketing in Marietta and ultimately supported both Democrats because she wants to see major policy change in response to the pandemic and voting rights. However, she did consider voting for Perdue because she wasn't excited about Ossoff's candidacy either.\\n\\nShe has voted Republican in the past and understands why people would split their votes.\\n\\nAll politics are local. And then when you go into that little booth, and you are tapping those names, you just want decent people, she said. You just want decent people that in times that you need them, to have the courage to stand up for what's right."}
{"original": "Wyatt Cenac Wants To Talk About Policing\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anne Marie Fox/HBO Anne Marie Fox/HBO\\n\\nWyatt Cenac knows his aesthetic, and his aesthetic seems to be PBS in the 1970s.\\n\\nThe logo of his new HBO series Wyatt Cenac's Problem Areas looks precisely like the public television of a couple decades ago, with its friendly-looking sans serif lowercase letters in earthy colors. The set is the same way, looking much like one that a host might have wandered around to talk about the beginnings of the world or the ways of the penguin.\\n\\nCenac is gently sending up that documentary format while also embracing it in a series, scheduled to run 10 episodes, that takes as its central mission the investigation of the problems of American policing. And while the show — done without an audience — contains plenty of jokes, the mission and the research are serious.\\n\\nIn the first episode last week, Cenac visited Minnesota, where Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in 2016. He talked not only to Peter Lindstrom, the mayor of Falcon Heights, where Castile was shot, but also to officials in the Ramsey County sheriff's office, who are trying to improve hiring practices.\\n\\nCenac's strategy isn't unlike John Oliver's: The comedy is both brutal and silly at times, but it frames a genuine attempt to convey information in a landscape that seems to desperately need it. Indeed, Oliver is an executive producer here. Another is Ezra Edelman, who directed O.J.: Made In America, probably one of the best documentaries ever made about race in America.\\n\\nThere will be 10 episodes, and Cenac has assembled a cast of public officials, activists, police officers, academics and others to reflect — sometimes in opposition to each other — on whatever question is at hand. These are not boring talking heads, but the precisely right people to push a conversation forward. (They include, for instance, Jill Leovy, who wrote the book Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America, which I mention mostly so that I can tell you again that if you have not read Ghettoside, it is one of the best pieces of nonfiction I have ever read.)\\n\\nThere's a bit of an evolution that's come to pass along a bumpy line of comedy-news shows as Jon Stewart led to Stephen Colbert and then John Oliver and then Larry Wilmore and Samantha Bee and Robin Thede, and now Wyatt Cenac. All these shows are different, but they share some lineage and have in common a desire to comment on news in ways that are funny. While the connections between them are clear, the later shows in this arc have become more biting and less glib, and certainly more willing to acknowledge that they have points of view and make arguments.\\n\\nThe Daily Show under Stewart remained committed to the idea that it was not journalism and was comedy only, despite considerable evidence that its place in the world said otherwise. But Oliver has never shied away from trying to influence policy or politics. Wilmore was freely opinionated. Bee gives no flips whether you like what she has to say, and while she wants it to be funny, she's not saying it just to be funny.\\n\\nCenac is the same way. The show is funny and well-written (the head writer is Hallie Haglund, who comes from The Daily Show), but it's not a joke. It sets you up with a couple of brief segments done in a more comedic style (the two in the premiere were about billionaire space exploration and recycling human waste into fuel), and then, while the jokes don't disappear, the policing segment starts. It's a promising format.\\n\\nHBO has put it on Friday nights, which presumably means a lot of the viewing will be on demand. So fire up your HBO, if you have it, and enjoy Wyatt Cenac's Problem Areas.\\n\\nAlthough ... it's just as upsetting in places as it means to be, so enjoy might be the wrong word."}
{"original": "Impeachment Trial Recap: Hours Of Q&A But Still No Clarity On New Witnesses\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 10:08 p.m. ET\\n\\nSenators fought a genteel melee over new witnesses in the impeachment trial on Wednesday but even hours' worth of questions, answers, and litigation on other issues didn't reveal an obvious path forward.\\n\\nMembers used dozens of written submissions over several hours to argue for and against the case for witnesses, the strength of the impeachment case and, in some cases, to actually ask questions.\\n\\nBut as the Q&A session rolled on Wednesday ahead of another session scheduled for Thursday, the way ahead still was not clear as to whether John Bolton or other witnesses might appear.\\n\\nAt this point it's obvious — we don't have the votes yet, said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., talking to reporters during a break.\\n\\nThe issue about Bolton's testimony isn't only important to the substance of the evidence in the case, but how much longer the trial goes.\\n\\nIf the Senate were to reject the admission of Bolton or other witnesses in a vote expected on Friday, it could close down the proceedings comparatively quickly — quickly in Senate terms at least.\\n\\nIf the chamber admits Bolton, that could add days, weeks or more.\\n\\nAmbassador Bolton\\n\\nAlthough Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is understood to have told senators that he can't marshal enough support to block witnesses and simply end the trial, it also isn't clear whether, if senators voted to admit new witnesses, they could then agree on which ones or the rules under which they could testify.\\n\\nThe White House has warned senators that it might resist an attempt to call former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials and that could result in months of legal gridlock that would idle the Senate.\\n\\nWe're going to be here for a very, very long time and that's not good for the United States, warned lawyer Jay Sekulow.\\n\\nPresident Trump's attorneys also argue that the Senate shouldn't be a fact-finding body in the impeachment process and that it must deal with the evidence only developed so far by the House.\\n\\nBolton himself also presents special issues, lawyer Patrick Philbin argued on Wednesday, because his role might be protected most strongly by the doctrine of executive privilege, which permits an administration to shield some of its workings from the public.\\n\\nNational security and foreign affairs are the crown jewels of executive privilege, Philbin said. To suggest of the national security adviser, 'Oh, we'll just subpoena him, he'll come in, it'll be easy' — that's not the way it would work.\\n\\nPhilbin also confirmed that the White House has notified Bolton that the manuscript he has submitted for pre-publication review contains what it considers top secret information and accordingly can't be published until it's been cleared.\\n\\nThat raises the stakes for Bolton to appear himself, or for senators to get access to the manuscript — if they can reach some kind of accommodation among themselves.\\n\\nHouse impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., warned Senators that he believed the White House is trying to stonewall them the way he argues it already has the House.\\n\\nResolving issues over witnesses needn't take unduly long, he said, among other reasons because senators already have U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presiding over the proceedings. Schiff said he trusts Roberts to adjudicate questions of witnesses and process — and quickly.\\n\\nThe bottom line, Schiff said, is to bring all relevant evidence into the process to make it legitimate.\\n\\nYou can't have a fair trial without witnesses, he said.\\n\\nQuestions to the desk\\n\\nSenators wrote questions on specially printed cards that were then carried to Roberts, who read them either for the House Democrats or Trump's lawyers.\\n\\nSenators used their questions to set up partisan allies to deliver talking points, ask questions of opponents that might embarrass them, and, occasionally, to try to elicit new information.\\n\\nEars across Washington perked up each time Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah were associated with a query; they're among the small group of potential rebels who might join with Democrats to vote to add witnesses.\\n\\nFour such Republicans would be required. Although the descriptions about McConnell's remarks to senators this week suggested he may have a sense about which ones have reached that decision, their identities weren't certain.\\n\\nOne thing that was resolved by events on Wednesday was that Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner would not vote for new witnesses, his office said. Arizona Sen. Martha McSally later joined him with a statement on Twitter.\\n\\nOtherwise much of the discussion in the Senate chamber involved lobbing parliamentary brickbats, with the odd philosophical digression about the nature of presidential power.\\n\\nThe professor\\n\\nAnother of Trump's attorneys, Alan Dershowitz, for example, argued that because a president always believes his own election and administration are in the public interest, it's virtually impossible for him to act officially without also acting for his own personal benefit — except in cases when he might profit financially.\\n\\nAnd that means he can't be impeached on the basis of motives that no outside person could parse, he argued.\\n\\nIt cannot be a corrupt motive if you have a mixed motive that partially involves the national interest, Dershowitz said.\\n\\nDemocratic senators rejected that notion in questions that set the stage for Schiff to repeat his criticisms of Trump's broad claims of power under the Constitution.\\n\\nWhat you see is a president who identifies the state as being himself, Schiff said.\\n\\nAnother Democratic manager rejected the idea, raised in a question, that Trump circumvented any wrongdoing because the military assistance he froze for Ukraine last year ultimately was released and allowed to flow as Congress intended.\\n\\nNo, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. — first because the Government Accountability Office has since concluded that freeze broke the law but also because, under Democrats' attempted extortion metaphor, Trump still had abused his power.\\n\\nGetting caught doesn't mitigate the wrongdoing, Lofgren said.\\n\\nThe Biden impeachment\\n\\nOther questions focused on the Constitutional standards for impeachable conduct, the president's power to conduct foreign policy and what standard of evidence should apply in the trial.\\n\\nMany of Democrats' questions emphasized witnesses and actions by Trump.\\n\\nMeanwhile, many Republicans' questions underscored what they called the weakness of the process so far and also included reminders about the role of Vice President Joe Biden in the Ukraine saga.\\n\\nTrump sought investigations by Ukraine's president including one into Biden and his son Hunter, who was paid by a Ukrainian gas company at the same time Biden was leading Ukraine policy for the administration of President Obama.\\n\\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who gave a presentation about the Bidens earlier in the trial, reprised what she called the troubling story and used, as Trump's camp had promised before, the impeachment of Trump as an impeachment of Biden.\\n\\nOther subsequent questions afforded openings later in the evening for Trump's team to revive the subject of Biden and what his attorneys suggested might be wrongdoing during the Obama era.\\n\\nNo official inquiry has cleared the Bidens or debunked the allegations they might have acted improperly, argued Trump attorney Eric Herschmann.\\n\\nHouse manager Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., urged senators to confine their discussion in the chamber to what she called the heart of the matter.\\n\\nAs we go through this very tough, very difficult debate over whether to impeach and remove the president of the United States I'd ask that we stay focused, she said. The last few days we've seen many distractions, many things have been said to take our minds off the truth of why we're really here."}
{"original": "RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\\n\\nDisasters in the Mediterranean have not slowed down the exodus of migrants and refugees trying to get into Europe. Last month alone, up to 900 are believed to have died at sea. Today, the 28 member nations of the European Union will consider a proposal to share the burden of resettling the tens of thousands of migrants who have reached Europe, and it wants the U.N. Security Council to approve a military operation to seize and destroy boats smuggling those migrants, most which leave from Libya. Let's hear more about this now from NPR's Sylvia Poggioli, who is on the line from Rome. Good morning.\\n\\nSYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Sylvia, what do we know about this plan to share the burden of these migrants?\\n\\nPOGGIOLI: Well, the actual details are still very sketchy, and that's probably because the opposition's going to be pretty intense. The proposal calls for a mandatory quota system, under which migrants who are currently in the EU would be relocated to other member states based on what the population, GDP and jobless rate is in each of those states. Italy, which has borne the brunt of the recent influx, has more than 80,000 migrants registered in its reception centers, in addition to an unknown number of unregistered migrants. And Greece and Malta are the other two front-line states in this crisis.\\n\\nBut Britain's newly elected Conservative government has already said it will exercise its right to opt out of any such legislation. And, you know, pressure's growing from anti-immigrant parties across the continent, so getting it approved by the remaining members won't be easy. The opposition is strongest in Eastern Europe, places like Poland and the Czech Republic. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, called it an unfair and indecent proposal.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Well, European Union members have long been at odds over migration policies. They're viewed as issues of national sovereignty and security. And, as you've just suggested, they don't want the burden of these newcomers. So why now an attempt to forge a common policy? Have things just got that bad?\\n\\nPOGGIOLI: Well, certainly the death last month of the some 900 migrants and the continuing flow from Libya is definitely jolting the European Union into doing something. And in this so-called EU new migration agenda that they have, there are other things. It calls also for an overhaul of asylum regulations. It would introduce a European asylum process, which is not the case today. Now it's done in the individual countries. Last year, there were a record 600,000 requests for asylum in Europe.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: And talk to us about this possible military operation to hunt down human traffickers and destroy their boats. How likely is that to happen?\\n\\nPOGGIOLI: Well, depends who's talking. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, sounded very optimistic after her talks at the U.N., but many diplomats and human rights activists are skeptical about using force against smugglers in international waters and Libyan territorial waters. Obviously the boats would have to be empty before they're going to be destroyed, and that means probably raising them down inside Libyan ports. But that, of course, raises the Libya conundrum; it's in a state of anarchy with two rival governments, and the one that's internationally recognized says it won't authorize the use of force on its territory.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: And also the EU foreign policy chief this week told the U.N. that refugees and migrants intercepted at sea will not be sent back against their will. So that sounds like the smugglers will stay in business.\\n\\nPOGGIOLI: It's a booming business. A report released yesterday by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime - that's a network of law enforcement and development groups - says the smuggling trade is worth up to $323 million a year in Libya alone and that much of that money is being funneled into terrorist groups, including the self-proclaimed Islamic State. The report also says that intervening off Libya's coast is unlikely to stop the human flow to Europe because the smugglers don't really care what happens to migrants once they've left Libyan shores.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: Sylvia, thanks very much.\\n\\nPOGGIOLI: Thank you, Renee.\\n\\nMONTAGNE: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli speaking to us from Rome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2015 NPR.

{"original": "Kenya Barris On 'Black-ish' And What Kids Lose When They Grow Up With More\\n\\nBarris says his ABC comedy series is about raising your kids in a different environment than you were accustomed to being raised in. Originally broadcast May 18, 2016.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to continue our holiday week series featuring some of our favorite interviews of the year with Kenya Barris, the creator and show-runner of the ABC sitcom Black-ish. One of the show's fans is Michelle Obama. I spoke to Barris last May at the conclusion of the second season.\\n\\nThe series is about a 40-ish husband and father, Andre, who goes by the name Dre. He grew up in the inner city but is now an advertising executive living in a predominantly white suburb with his biracial wife, who's a doctor, and their four children. In the pilot, he's promoted to vice president of the urban division, which leads him to think he's become the token black executive. He's afraid his children are becoming too assimilated. Dre's son is also named Andre, but his white friends call him Andy, which sounds all wrong to Dre.\\n\\nThe son has joined the field hockey team, and that doesn't sound black at all to his father. And the son has a lot of Jewish friends and he wants a big bar mitzvah party like the ones they're having, so he's considering converting and changing his name to Shlomo or Shmuel. So the father, played by Anthony Anderson, decides it's time to draw the line and calls a family meeting.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BLACK-ISH)\\n\\nANTHONY ANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) All right, listen up. I may have to be urban at work, but I'm still going to need my family to be black, not black-ish but black. So we're going to start with some strict guidelines.\\n\\nYARA SHAHIDI: (As Zoey Johnson) So then he sent me a smiley face with a wink. I mean, I should be offended, right?\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Zoey.\\n\\nSHAHIDI: (As Zoey Johnson) I'll text you.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) All right. From heretoforth (ph), we are going to keep it real. So, Junior, if I hear anybody calling you Shlomo or Shmuel or especially Andy, I'm going to back you over and whoever else is saying it in my car.\\n\\nMARCUS SCRIBNER: (As Andre Johnson) Dad.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Quiet. Now, I may have to watch you play possibly the dumbest sport in the world, but I do not have to sit back and listen to you rave about other kids' bar mitzvahs. So next Saturday when you turn 13, you're becoming a man, too - a black man because I'm throwing you an African rites of passage ceremony - ha.\\n\\nSCRIBNER: (As Andre Johnson) That does not sound as fun.\\n\\nSHAHIDI: (As Zoey Johnson) No, it does not.\\n\\nTRACEE ELLIS ROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) OK, I have an idea. Why don't we take a black break and go get some white yogurt?\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) That's a scene from the first episode of Black-ish.\\n\\nKENYA BARRIS: I was laughing listening to that 'cause it so reminds me of a moment I would've had with my kids. And it really was based on my family. You know, my wife is - she's an anesthesiologist. She's mixed. My kids are growing up in a different situation than I grew up in.\\n\\nGROSS: By mixed do you mean she's...\\n\\nBARRIS: She's black and white.\\n\\nGROSS: Right, she has a white parent and a black parent, yeah.\\n\\nBARRIS: Her dad's white, and her mom is black. And we came from a different situation than our kids, and me and my wife are both in different situations. And we're raising our kids up - me in particular, my kids are nothing like I remember, quote, unquote, black kids being when I was a kid.\\n\\nSo I'm sort of trying to navigate what that's going to be for me. You know, I'm - you're taught to give your kids more, but in giving them more, like, what do they lose? And I think that's sort of was the conceit and premise of the show.\\n\\nGROSS: So you changed class (laughter) when you were a child in a way because there was this sudden influx of money. Do you want to explain what happened?\\n\\nBARRIS: A couple of things happened. My father lost a lung in a chemical accident at General Motors. And after a while he got a settlement that sort of changed all of our lives and moved us from what we - you know, say ashy to classy in some aspects. At the same time, my mother had gotten her real estate license and, you know, she was really, really entrepreneurial and started selling real estate. And her life sort of changed around that same time.\\n\\nAnd we basically - my sister and brother had gotten into college. They were going to USC. And it was - all of a sudden, we sort of went from one segment of the socioeconomic ladder and we sort of went up a rung. And it was, you know, around the time for me where I was just old enough to kind of see really both sides, and it really influenced who I am.\\n\\nGROSS: In your show, Black-ish, it's as if the children are growing up in a different country than the parents did because of technology, you know, because of, like, social media and cellphones and also because of class and because they don't think as much about race 'cause race isn't separating them from mainstream culture in America the way it did for the parents or at least for the father.\\n\\nTherefore things that mean so much to the father, like witnessing the inauguration of the first black president, don't mean that much to the kids 'cause it's all they know. So they just take it for granted, like that's the way it is. And the father in Black-ish is concerned that his kids are picking up white norms and that they don't have, like, a black cultural context the way he did. You know, the father's name is Andre. He calls himself Dre. His son is Andre, but the kids at school are calling him Andy. His white friends are calling him Andy.\\n\\nBARRIS: (Laughter).\\n\\nGROSS: And the father just, like, hates that. And the son wants to get, you know, bar mitzvahed so he can have a lavish party like he sees his Jewish friends having. Then the - so the father decides - well, you're going to have a black rites of passage ceremony. You're going to have, you know, an African rites of passage ceremony. And that seems very righteous to the father and very boring and pointless to the son. And it just made me wonder if there were, in your family, generational differences on Afrocentricity.\\n\\nBARRIS: Absolutely. You know, actually, that particular story was an aggregate of Laurence Fishburne, Anthony Anderson and myself. Anthony Anderson actually has the copyright to the word bro mitzvah...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBARRIS: ...Because...\\n\\nGROSS: That's really great. Yeah.\\n\\nBARRIS: ...Because his son, you know, who was the only - as he calls him - the only little chocolate drop in his class - Anthony's from Compton. But, you know, he's been working in the entertainment industry for 22-some-odd years and had some successes. And so his family were - you know, his kids in particular - came up in a different situation.\\n\\nHis son came in, and I remember this when I started going to the schools. I remember that 12, 13, 14-year-old point where you're just going week to week to week to bar mitzvahs. And his son was doing that. And we don't have that in our culture. And Laurence said there was a time like that with his child. And he gave his kids an African rites of passage ceremony. And I remember getting that. But I remember - Laurence telling me about it - I remember thinking how not fun it was. My generation, I believe, was the first generation to really benefit directly from the Civil Rights movement. My mom, you know, went through civil rights. My dad went through civil rights. My name was Kenya because they wanted to give me an African name.\\n\\nAnd subsequently, my generation sort of took more of a - because we didn't really have, you know, foot-to-pavement or rubber-to-road type of marches and things like that. We took more of an intellectual, sort of revolutionary approach. There was Public Enemy. And, you know, the Malcolm X - you know, autobiography of Malcolm X exploded. There was the Malcolm X movie. There was Spike Lee. We sort of became more of philosophical revolutionaries.\\n\\nAnd now my kids in their generation - one of the moments I remember when I was pitching the show that really sparked for me is - the Trayvon Martin incident happened. And my daughter, you know, came in, and I was like - you know, how do you feel about this? And she was like - you know, we're really upset. She's like - we're - kids I know are protesting.\\n\\nAnd I'm like - oh, that's awesome. What are you doing? And she said - no, look, we're doing it on Instagram. And she shows me this Instagram picture, and it's just a black frame. It's like the picture - it's just an all-black thing. And I'm like - I'm looking - I'm like - OK, so where's the protest? She's like - this is it. Look at how many people are putting black on their Instagram. And I realized this must be the most low-rent protest I've ever seen...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBARRIS: ...In my life. I was like - I can't get, like, a small trash can fire?\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBARRIS: Like, I don't know. Like, anything? Like - and it really showed me the generational difference. And, you know, I think that that is one of the reasons - I did an episode this year called Hope where the family at the end - there was an incident, and the family decides to go down to the protest. The digital age kind of takes away from us. You know what I'm saying? We feel like we can sign online protests and do the - but I think we have to actually put rubber to road, foot to pavement, and be more proactive.\\n\\nGROSS: Let's talk about that episode called Hope. This is the family figuring out how to answer questions that are unanswerable questions from their children. So everybody is around the TV watching as the news is about to come down about whether a police officer accused of misconduct is going to be indicted or not. And what he's accused of is Tasering 37 times a man - a black man who was selling DVDs.\\n\\nAnd so, you know, they're watching - there's protesters kind of surrounding the site. And the family's watching this on TV. And it comes down that this officer is not going to be indicted. And then protests really break out. There's reports of fires and looting. And, you know, the children are wondering - like, especially the young 6-year-old is wondering, like, why is everybody so mad?\\n\\nSo the parents are trying to explain to them. And then they get into a kind of debate about the police and the justice system. And the mother is kind of defending some faith in the justice system. Like, the children have to learn how to, like, be polite to the cops 'cause, ultimately, the justice system works. And the father and grandfather are very skeptical of that idea.\\n\\nAnd she says, well, you - I don't want my kids to grow up in an environment where there's no hope. So this is a conversation between the father, Anthony Anderson, who plays Dre, and his wife Rainbow, who's played by Tracee Ellis Ross.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BLACK-ISH)\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Don't you get it, Bow? The system is rigged against us.\\n\\nROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) Maybe it is, Dre. But I don't want to feel like my kids are living in a world that is so flawed that they can't have any hope.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Oh, so you want to talk about hope, Bow? Obama ran on hope. Remember when he got elected? And we felt like maybe, just maybe, we got out of that bad place and made it to a good place, that the whole country was really ready to turn the corner. You remember that amazing feeling we had during the inauguration? I was sitting right next to you, and we were so proud.\\n\\nThen we saw him get out of that limo and walk alongside of it and wave to that crowd. Tell me you weren't terrified when you saw that. Tell me you weren't worried that someone was going to snatch that hope away from us like they always do. That is the real world, Bow, and our children need to know that that's the world that they live in.\\n\\nGROSS: So that's a scene from Black-ish. And that was Anthony Anderson that we heard. And my guest is the creator and show-runner of Black-ish, Kenya Barris. So you kind of spoke the unspeakable in that 'cause I think there's so many people who have been so worried for - you know, that somebody would do something to President Obama.\\n\\nYou know, and I don't even want to say the word (laughter). And it's like you were directly addressing that fear in that in addition to kind of getting to the injustice of the justice system.\\n\\nBARRIS: I mean, it's so weird - I kind of am - like, am getting choked up a little bit. Like, hearing that on the radio, it's different than seeing it on television. The words are a little bit more piercing. Wow, Anthony did a really, really good job. And I think, yes, we - you know, I had no idea when I was writing - you know, I was terrified when I was writing that because I was like, that's not what - this is not what this show is. It's a comedy. I was struggling during the writing process to sort of make sure keeping the tone.\\n\\nUltimately, that episode, although it's really kind of, you know, taken on a life of its own, was not at its inception about police brutality. The conceit and the inception of the idea was that how do you have conversations with your kids about things that you're not necessarily wanting to have conversations with them about and how do you have those conversations and not let your past experiences sort of scorch the Earth of what their future is going to be?\\n\\nAnd we took the idea of police brutality because we felt like it was something so organic to what we're going through right now and what this family would be going through. And it actually really - that particular moment actually really happened with me and so I really wanted to tell that conversation. And I think that moment of television for me is probably the most special thing I'll ever be involved in. I just don't think as a comedy writer you get to be involved in things like that, but it was a sort of cathartic week for everybody involved.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Kenya Barris, the creator of the ABC series Black-ish. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Kenya Barris, the creator of the ABC sitcom Black-ish.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: So one of the episodes was about the N-word and - can you say it? Who's allowed to say it? Who decides who's allowed to say it? (Laughter) And the premise of this episode is that the 6-year-old son was performing at a school talent show. And for his performance, he was doing Kanye's Gold Digger and using the N-word in all the ways - in all the places that Kanye does on the recording. And the school punishes him because they have a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech.\\n\\nAnd the parents are really upset, you know, thinking, like - who are these people to tell us if we can use the N-word? But there's even a fight within the family between the father and the mother about whether it's OK for their son to be using it in that context on the talent show. So let's hear a little bit of this dispute (laughter) between the father and mother about the N-word. And I should just say before we hear this clip that every time you hear a little music, it's a little flashback scene in which we hear the person who's denying that they ever use the N-word actually having used it.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, BLACK-ISH)\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Damn it. It's his birthright. Jewish kids get to go to Israel. Black kids get to say this.\\n\\nROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) Dre, that is ridiculous. Nobody should say it. It is an ugly, hateful word with an even uglier and hate-filled history.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Yeah, of it being said to us, not by us.\\n\\nROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) Oh, my God.\\n\\nLAURENCE FISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) As usual, son, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) But...\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) That is not a word that black folks need to be using - ever.\\n\\nROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) No.\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) You see I never used it.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) What?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) [Expletive] acting like these lights around here are going to pay for themselves.\\n\\nWell, I only said it to separate myself from the rest of you people.\\n\\nJENIFER LEWIS: (As Ruby Johnson) Mm-hm. Unlike Earl, I really never say it.\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) What?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nLEWIS: (As Ruby Johnson) Watch it, [expletive].\\n\\nSaying it to your daddy's trifling behind don't count.\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) Oh, agreed. All we're saying is, of course every now and then, it slips out. But it's never said casually and never in mixed company.\\n\\nLEWIS: (As Ruby Johnson) Exactly. It's only a judgment said with disdainful indictment.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Pops, you and mom's generation used the word for self-hate. You made it negative. My generation - we reclaimed it. And we use it as a term of colloquialism and power, same way the slaves took the leftover pig guts and found them plants growing in the woods and turned it into chitlins and collard greens. That's what we did with the N-word.\\n\\nFISHBURNE: (As Earl Johnson) Yeah, here he come with that chitlin argument.\\n\\nLEWIS: (As Ruby Johnson) Can you believe this [expletive]?\\n\\nROSS: (As Rainbow Johnson) Hey, hey.\\n\\nANDERSON: (As Dre Johnson) Mom.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. So that was a scene from Black-ish. And we heard Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross as the parents and Larry Fishburne and Jenifer Lewis as the grandparents. And my guest Kenya Barris is the creator and show-runner of Black-ish.\\n\\nSo how do you think of the word? Do you think it as word that, like, your generation reclaimed and it's OK for some people, but not others to use it, which is the argument that Anthony Anderson makes in this?\\n\\nBARRIS: (Laughter) Well, I'm usually going to side on Dre's side (laughter) because Dre is sort of based upon - on me and, you know, Anthony. But yes, I think that the word is - it's interesting. I think it is one of the most divisive, densely discoursed, just, polarizing words in American history. And I feel like, you know, words - as a writer, I believe that words are powerful. But I do believe that words also in having - anything that has power means it has growth. And in having growth, it can evolve. And I think that that word has evolved, you know, and has, you know, generational differences for different people.\\n\\nFor me, in my particular way that I look at it - and I think that the character Dre, you know, came out to say is that I feel like the word - you know, obviously there's the E-R and the A-H and, you know, the things that go along with the word. But I feel like, in general, to not get into that specific of it, I feel like the word is sort of a tribal badge. You know, I do look at it for myself.\\n\\nYou know, my generation looked at it as something that we took the disdainful indictment that my mom's generation would use it in because of how it was said to the generations before her. We took that away from it, and we made it sort of a, you know, a badge of tribalism between - sort of to say - between two members of that tribe to say look, I know that you're a part of this tribe. And we have some shared heritage, whether I know you or not.\\n\\nI think that I go back and forth because as an artist I also feel that - you know - that episode came because I found out that my daughter was using it with friends who were not black. You know, it had just become a colloquial word of coolness. And she didn't really - you know, so it - I think I go back and forth. I think the rappers have put it in songs, you know, for mass-marketed consumption that it's sort of hard to tell white kids they can't say words in songs that they buy. It's like buying a book - selling a book, but telling certain segments of society they can't read certain pages of the book. So I go back and forth because I do believe that art needs to be able to be expressed purely. But I know I have a battle with it.\\n\\nGROSS: So every time the word is used on that episode - and the episode is all about that word - it's bleeped, which is usually what happens on network TV and often on basic cable as well. And we go back and forth on our show about whether we should let somebody use it or not uncovered or whether we should bleep it when they say it.\\n\\nBARRIS: Who wanted to use it? I'm very interested. Who said, hey...\\n\\nGROSS: Well - OK. Most recently, Jerrod Carmichael used it because we were talking about...\\n\\nBARRIS: Interesting. I love Jerrod.\\n\\nGROSS: ...The Carmichael Show's episode with that because they had - they did a show about whether it's OK or not to say it. And he's used the word in his comedy. And we actually were playing a sketch in which he - playing some of his stand-up in which he quotes somebody as using it.\\n\\nAnd so I asked him - well, should we bleep that or not? And he explained why he didn't think we should bleep it. And we - we actually left it unbleeped, although there are times we do bleep it.\\n\\nBut did you have a big discussion with ABC, with the executors there about whether they should bleep the N-word or not? Notice I'm not going to say the word (laughter).\\n\\nBARRIS: (Laughter) You know, it's crazy to - before I answer that question - it's - saying the N-word makes it almost more, you know what I'm saying - saying it makes it almost louder when you say the N-word. Like, I feel like one of the most interesting conversations that happened with ABC was around this episode. In an amazing, amazing way, they were going to let us say it. They were going to let us see how many we could say. You know, there was a debate. Like, we had, like, literally - I call it a N-word negotiation, because it was, like, literally - I'll give you two N-words for, you know...\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter).\\n\\nBARRIS: And what we ended up doing - and I'm so glad that, you know, my partner Jonathan Groff is - always sort of comes from the scientific method way of dealing with things. Like, we went and did an experiment. And there's nothing like being around a group of white people and just saying - you know, when two dudes are just saying it. And you just see them just cringing and, you know, tensing up or whatever. And, you know, we felt that, just like I told you, I think the N-word almost makes - saying the N-word makes it even louder.\\n\\nWe felt that beeping it - we played it with and without. And we felt that without the bleep limited our access points, limited our entry points for comedic accessibility. You know, we felt like you were going to be so sort of cringed every time the word was said that you were not going to be able to really hear it. And honestly, the beep made it even louder and funnier because you knew what was being said. You're saying it in your head, but it allows for you to comedically fall into the story, you know. So it was - it came from a really sort of thought out place.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Kenya Barris, creator of the ABC series Black-ish. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Kenya Barris, the creator of the ABC sitcom Black-ish.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nGROSS: So in The New Yorker profile that Emily Nussbaum wrote about you, you described how when you were a kid - and I don't know how old you were - during a period when you were, you know, getting into trouble sometimes and stuff, that you would approach white women at gas stations and ask them if you could pump their gas.\\n\\nNow, I am one of the white women who's been approached by kids at gas stations asking if they could pump my gas. And I thought it might be interesting if we compared notes about what that experience was like for each of us. Do you want to start or should I?\\n\\nBARRIS: Do you know what's crazy? Two things - I know where your notes are going to go.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBARRIS: I did not realize that that was the notes until I was an adult, you know what I'm saying? And I look back and not only did I realize I was terrifying these white women into - I was basically strong-arming them into giving me a dollar to do something they could easily do.\\n\\nBut I also was panhandling - I mean, I also was panhandling. And I just - I did not see it, you know what I'm saying? I feel like it's part of, like, you know, ghetto games. I feel like you do certain things. I was so proud of myself for being entrepreneurial and not being - going and selling drugs and doing this. But I was basically being a little strong-arm panhandler who was preying on people's, you know, sympathies and at the same time their fear. So I - I can - what are your notes? Let me hear your notes.\\n\\nGROSS: My notes are that there was something inherently patronizing or, you know, condescending or insulting about a kid coming up to me assuming I needed help pumping my gas.\\n\\nBARRIS: Oh, interesting.\\n\\nGROSS: Like, I do it all the time. Like, I can do that myself. Do I look, like, not strong enough to, like, handle the gas pump (laughter) you know?\\n\\nAnd then thinking back, well, what is the bargain that you are trying to make with me? What's being unsaid here? How much money do you expect from me? Is it a dollar? Is it $5? Is it $10? If I say yes, oh, please help me pump my gas and I give you a dollar, are you going to say - are you going to look at me like, hey, that's not enough? You know, like, what's all the subtext here?\\n\\nBARRIS: I think the subtext was what does it cost for you to keep me off the street and not take your wallet later?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBARRIS: Was is that worth to you? Is that worth a dollar? That's fine. I'm OK with that. Everybody's - this negotiation really works out well. You know, I didn't think of the feminist approach that you were saying in terms of I can't. That's the first time I've ever actually heard that. I thought of the idea of maybe I was sort of preying on your white liberal guilt that - you know what I'm saying? Like, oh, these kids are trying and - you know what I'm saying - and to do something and I'm going to do this. I thought - I was very aware of that part of it, you know, that I was sort of playing on the liberal, like, part of people feeling sorry for me.\\n\\nI wasn't aware 'til later that it sort of had a little bit of a strong-arming, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know, the idea of, like, are they afraid of taking out their wallet? I don't think I thought about that, and the one that hit me most recently is that I was a bum. I was panhandling. I was basically - was on the side of the road with a sign and I was really upset at myself. But to be completely fair, we could've been doing something else worse. And...\\n\\nGROSS: Well, that is the subtext, yes.\\n\\nBARRIS: That is the subtext. That is the subtext. And I think that was the understanding.\\n\\nGROSS: But did you ever? Like, if a woman said, no, thank you then what?\\n\\nBARRIS: We were fine. I mean, there were many times that we would say can - well, we'll do it for you for free, you know what I'm saying, many times. I mean, probably half the time we would say - you know, a lady would say I don't have this or whatever. And we're like, we'll do it for you anyway.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, Kenya Barris, it's been great talking with you. Thank you so much.\\n\\nBARRIS: Well, thank you so much for taking the time. I appreciate it.\\n\\nGROSS: Oh, my pleasure. Take good care.\\n\\nBARRIS: Thank you.\\n\\nGROSS: My interview with Kenya Barris was recorded in May. Barris created the ABC sitcom Black-ish. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we continue our series of some of our favorite interviews of the year with Francis Ford Coppola.

{"original": "Senate Begins Biden Cabinet Confirmation Hearings As Impeachment Trial Looms\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 1:55 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe day before Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, five of his Cabinet nominees will answer questions from Senate panels handling their confirmations. The busy committee calendar is ramping up at the same time an impeachment trial is expected to start, posing a split-screen challenge for the Senate, which is still reeling from an attack less than two weeks ago.\\n\\nThe process of vetting the top officials in the new administration comes as the Senate is still in a period of transition. Democrats are due to take the majority after winning a pair of runoff elections in Georgia earlier this month.\\n\\nSince Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the newly elected Democrats from Georgia, have not been sworn in yet, Republicans currently have the majority in the Senate, and GOP chairs will preside over the five confirmation hearings on Tuesday. Warnock and Ossoff's elections were certified on Tuesday by the Georgia secretary of state. They could be sworn in as early as Wednesday to officially begin their Senate work. In addition, Alex Padilla, appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to take the seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, is expected to sworn in as early as Wednesday. But the organization of the 50-50 Senate could take some time to sort out. Harris will serve as the tiebreaking vote since the vice president also serves as president of the Senate.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were meeting Tuesday to work out a power-sharing agreement that is expected to cover how committee assignments will work and how legislation will be considered on the Senate floor.\\n\\n(See who has been named to the Biden administration so far).\\n\\nUnlike previous administrations, President-elect Biden will not have top national security Cabinet officials confirmed as he takes office. But his transition team said the incoming president plans to appoint acting agency heads from career civil service ranks as the Senate considers and votes on his nominees to lead the departments.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is expected to transmit the article of impeachment that the House approved last week soon. But until she does, the timeline for a trial and the rules that would govern how long it would last or whether witnesses will be called are still unclear. Biden has made it clear he believes the Senate can balance both the trial, confirmation votes and consideration of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.\\n\\nMinnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar downplayed the multitasking challenge in an interview on CNN on Monday. We can do three things at once in the Senate, Klobuchar said. Moms are juggling their toddlers on their knees and their laptops on their desks right now.\\n\\nThe fallout from the violent attack by pro-Trump extremists on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 is still reverberating among lawmakers as more arrests continue to reveal details about the siege and motivations of those involved. Some of the committees involved in confirmations are likely to also take up reviews of their own.\\n\\nThe first five hearings on Tuesday include nominees who are already signaling sharp departures from the policies enacted under President Trump. They also showcase the diversity that Biden has vowed to be a hallmark of his Cabinet, and more broadly of his approach to his presidency.\\n\\nDefense\\n\\nUp to 25,000 National Guard troops have been activated to help patrol Washington, D.C., due to concerns over increased domestic terrorism threats around Wednesday's inauguration. Questions about the military's role are likely to come up at retired four-star Gen. Lloyd Austin's confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services committee. Austin would be the first African American defense secretary if confirmed by the Senate. He will need a waiver approved by both the House and Senate to take the position because he has not been out of uniform for the required seven years.\\n\\nAustin will likely face questions about the plans for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, after President Trump reduced the military footprint there. He will also be peppered with questions about his views on the posture for the military with regard to threats from Iran, Russia and China.\\n\\nHomeland Security\\n\\nThe insurrection at the Capitol was a central topic at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing with Alejandro Mayorkas, the incoming administration's nominee to be secretary of homeland security.\\n\\nMayorkas vowed to do everything in his power to prevent another such attack from happening again.\\n\\nThe department has had a lot of turnover at the top under President Trump and faced controversy over implementing controversial immigration policies. Mayorkas, a Cuban American, would become the first Latino at the top of the agency.\\n\\nRon Klain, the incoming White House chief of staff, has already indicated that the administration will take executive action on its first day in power to roll back the travel ban instituted by the Trump administration restricting immigration from some Muslim countries.\\n\\nState\\n\\nAntony Blinken, Biden's nominee to be the next secretary of state, is a familiar face to many on Capitol Hill. He served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration and was a longtime top aide to Biden.\\n\\nAppearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, he promised humility and confidence. Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urged Senate Republicans on the panel to dig deep into the many foreign policy areas where we have heard very little from the incoming administration.\\n\\nKlain also said the administration will move immediately to rejoin the Paris climate accords, a topic that could come up on Tuesday. But after President Trump's America First mantra, Blinken has vowed to restore America's credibility on the global stage. He will also face questions about how he will approach strained relationships with key allies and handle rising threats from Iran, North Korea, Russia and China.\\n\\nIntelligence\\n\\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee heard from Avril Haines, Biden's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, on Tuesday. She said trust and confidence need to be restored in the intelligence community, where there is simply no place for politics, ever.\\n\\nIf confirmed, Haines would be the first woman to hold the post. Many Democratic lawmakers over the past four years have complained about the politicization of intelligence and the lack of briefings for members around key events. Many warned that the U.S. needs to be more vigilant about the threats from Russia and China.\\n\\nThe hack of several federal agencies in December, which many believe was orchestrated by Russia's intelligence arm, is one issue that Congress is still investigating, and lawmakers will want details on how the Biden administration plans to respond.\\n\\nTreasury\\n\\nFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, answered questions before the Senate Finance Committee and urged Congress to act big. She would make history as the first female Treasury secretary if confirmed. Since she was nominated, she appears to have some bipartisan support because many are already familiar with her reputation over her tenure in government.\\n\\nLast week, Biden rolled out a massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 proposal to help juice the struggling economy. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to many Americans, but one key Democrat — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — is already saying he thinks any additional checks need to be targeted. The move to add a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is already a non-starter for many in the GOP and could also be problematic for some centrist Democrats. Both of those issues, as well as additional support for small businesses, are likely to come up during the hearing.\\n\\nIt's unclear how quickly votes on these five nominees will move to the full Senate if they receive committee approval. But as Democrats take control of the chamber, they are expected to move swiftly and have the votes to install Cabinet nominees absent any new vetting issues."}
{"original": "As Pompeo Dumps Rulebook For U.S.-Taiwan Relations, Some See 'Trap' For Biden\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nThe U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands sent a jubilant tweet on Monday, claiming to have made some history today. He had welcomed Taiwan's de facto ambassador into the U.S. Embassy for a meeting.\\n\\nFor the past four decades, it's been generally off-limits for U.S. ambassadors to invite Taiwanese officials into embassies. Ever since the United States switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, America's relations with the government in Taiwan have been unofficial. To keep it that way, a complex and ever-changing set of rules has guided how executive branch officials should deal with the Taiwanese.\\n\\nBut on Jan. 9, with less than two weeks left in President Trump's term, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was throwing out the rule book. U.S. relations with Taiwan would remain unofficial, he said, but wouldn't be shackled by self-imposed restrictions.\\n\\nExecutive branch agencies should consider all 'contact guidelines' regarding relations with Taiwan previously issued by the Department of State...to be null and void, he said in a statement. The United States government took these actions unilaterally, in an attempt to appease the Communist regime in Beijing. No more.\\n\\nAnalysts see the policy reversal as the latest in a series of steps taken this year by the Trump administration, with Pompeo in the lead, to lock in a more hawkish, confrontational stance against China. Pompeo and others have declared that China constitutes America's biggest threat.\\n\\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft was scheduled to travel to Taiwan this week, marking a first since formal U.S.-Taiwan relations ended. An end-of-term travel ban at the State Department prevented the trip, but she spoke with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen by phone and asserted that the U.S. would always stand with Taiwan.\\n\\nBeijing considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of China, and has vowed to unify it politically with the mainland — by force, if necessary. Taiwan has been central to China-U.S. relations from the start.\\n\\nSo the big question you have to ask is: Why is Pompeo doing this now? They could have done it a year ago and then managed the fallout if they felt that this was so important, says Evan Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University who was senior Asia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.\\n\\nI think the answer is that this is meant to be a trap, he says.\\n\\nIn other words, if President-elect Joe Biden maintains the policy shift, his relationship with China may be rougher. If he reinstates the guidelines for dealing with Taiwan, he creates a political vulnerability that he's being soft on China, Medeiros says.\\n\\nOn both sides of the political aisle in the U.S., the appetite for firmer policies against China seems to have increased over the past few years. Most China-related legislation that has come up for a vote in Congress recently has passed with strong bipartisan support, if not unanimity.\\n\\nThe Republican Party has amped up its tough-on-China policy rhetoric. Analysts think Biden will come under attack from the right if he rolls back any of Trump's China moves, from steep trade tariffs and the closure of China's consulate in Houston this summer to scrapping the rules on interactions with Taiwan.\\n\\nBut Richard Bush, a Taiwan expert with the Brookings Institution, says recent events in the United States may have changed the equation.\\n\\nWe're in a situation where the head of the Republican Party has incited violence against his own government, we're in a Republican Party that could not hold on to two Senate seats in Georgia, he says.\\n\\nIf the Biden administration does a good job of consulting with Democratic lawmakers, in this case on Taiwan policy, the Republican attacks could probably be deflected, he says.\\n\\nIt's unclear how much of Trump's China policy Biden will change. The first step will likely be a time-consuming policy review.\\n\\nBut even if the Biden team moves swiftly to put the U.S.-China relationship back on a less antagonistic track, Beijing will be wary after the dramatic changes of the past four years.\\n\\nSusan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia and the Pacific before retiring from the State Department in 2018, thinks many aspects of Trump's China policy are reversible. But, she says, the Chinese leadership's view of things may have changed as American rhetoric hardened.\\n\\nEven if they think that it's mostly about four years under Trump, their assessment of the situation in U.S.-China relations has to have moved considerably, she says. They would like to stabilize things, but they probably have a pretty jaundiced view of where the U.S. wants to take all of this, even under Biden.\\n\\nFor now, Beijing is in wait-and-see mode. The foreign ministry responded to Pompeo's latest move by calling on the United States to abide by the promises it made when relations were established in 1979 and keep its contacts with Taiwan informal.\\n\\nThey're obviously waiting Trump out, says Thornton.\\n\\nBut she adds: Even if Biden makes an attempt to work on some projects with China in a cooperative way, I think that they will not forget what's happened."}
{"original": "ICE Failed to Hold Detention Center Contractors Accountable, Report Finds\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement failed to hold private contractors accountable for problems at detention facilities where migrants in the country illegally are held, according to a report from the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nThe report detailed several of the most egregious cases, including contractors failing to notify ICE of sexual assaults and employee misconduct, using tear gas instead of approved pepper spray, and commingling detainees with serious criminal histories with those who might be at risk of sexual assault.\\n\\nIn all of those cases, the contractors did not face any monetary penalties.\\n\\nThe report focuses on 106 detention facilities run by private contractors that hold, on average, 25,000 detainees a day. ICE can fine those contractors when deficiencies are found. Such monetary penalties are a key tool for ensuring that safety standards are followed and detainees are treated fairly.\\n\\nAccording to the report, ICE found 14,000 deficiencies between October 2015 and June 2018 but issued only two fines. The two cases that did lead to fines involved detention center workers being underpaid and poor health care and mental health standards.\\n\\nICE did not dispute the findings and said it would implement changes, according to the report.\\n\\nThis isn't the first time DHS's inspector general has put out a report calling out ICE for serious deficiencies in its inspection or contracting process, said Madhuri Grewal, federal immigration policy counsel with the ACLU.\\n\\nAs the Trump administration expanded its crackdown on people living in the country illegally, ICE rapidly expanded the number of detention centers around the country. ICE now spends $3 billion for private contractor detention.\\n\\nIn recent years, DHS's inspector general found ICE doesn't follow procurement guidelines for detention contractors and doesn't fully examine actual conditions. ICE agreed with the findings in each report and said it would implement changes.\\n\\nAccording to the most recent inspector general's report, ICE agents assigned to inspect detention centers may have unachievable workloads that prevent them from being able to provide appropriate oversight.\\n\\nHouse Democrats currently negotiating the Homeland Security Department's 2019 funding put forward budget proposals to add $7 million to ramp up the number of detention center inspections.\\n\\nImmigration rights advocates are also asking Congress to cut DHS's detention funding. Grewal said the ACLU is advocating for a specific prohibition that prevents ICE from looting other agencies — like FEMA — to further expand detention."}
{"original": "Saturday Sports: Robert Kraft, Zion Williamson\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nAnd it's time for sports. There are more charges of misbehavior in the NFL - this time by an owner. A major college star sprains his knee when his Nike comes apart - so did their stock prices. We're going to turn now to Howard Bryant of ESPN The Magazine and espn.com. Howard, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nHOWARD BRYANT, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. How are you?\\n\\nSIMON: Fine, thanks. Robert Kraft, owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, faces misdemeanor charges of solicitation at a day spa in Palm Beach County, Fla. He denies the charges. They are serious because police say that the solicitation at this spa is tied to human trafficking. Now how likely is it the NFL will discipline maybe its most powerful owner?\\n\\nBRYANT: Well, I think it's pretty likely that he'll be disciplined at some level. The severity of the discipline I would tend to doubt is going to be particularly harsh. I could be wrong about this, but I think when you look at the history of owners dealing with their own - it's not like they're dealing with a player because you have an owner-management-labor relationship where they are - they took a long time to go after their greatest superstar, Tom Brady, over a couple of years' worth. But I don't think they'll ever do that to another owner. You remember Robert Irsay the - I'm sorry, Jim Irsay, the owner of the Colts, had his drug issue, and he didn't really - I mean, he got a little bit punished but not really punished I think.\\n\\nLet's also not forget the Washington Redskins had the - in 2013, they had forced their own cheerleaders to go on a business trip to Costa Rica and be escorts for some of the ownership group, for some of their executives. So I think, obviously, owners are not going to be as harsh on other owners. Let's not forget that the commissioner may discipline ownership, but the owner works for the commissioner. So we'll see what happens, but I have a hard time believing the billionaire class is going to be that hard on itself.\\n\\nSIMON: I want to tie two stories of the week together, if I can. Thirty seconds into the Duke-Carolina game, President Obama in the stands, Zion Williamson, Duke's transcendent player, sprained his knee. His Nike came apart like a cheap suit in a rain storm. And then USA Today reports the NBA has proposed lowering the league's draft age to 18. Zion Williamson is 18. Isn't it only fair to him and other great 18-year-old athletes to be allowed to play pro ball? So if they're going to risk a career injury, they do it while being paid gobs of money.\\n\\nBRYANT: Yeah. Well, in my opinion 15, 16, 17 and 18-year-old players - and you watch tennis - Tracy Austin was 14 years old when she played up against Chris Evert. And so to me, it's always been collusion. You always look at what's taken place between the leagues and the colleges. If you have the ability to play a certain sport, you should be able to play it. I think that we remember not too long ago - it was only about 15 years ago - where they had the rookie age limit when they raised it because they didn't think that the players were mature enough for their millions because they didn't like the look of the new hip-hop generation walking around with gold chains instead of three-piece suits. And so there was a lot of consternation about that.\\n\\nAnd then they are the ones that created this one-and-done situation that you have now where you have these great players who are eligible - Zion Williamson could play in the NBA right now, and the only reason that his shoe blew up and he's playing for no money and risked an entire future in the NBA is because the NBA doesn't let him play in the league right now. So the fact that they're finally going back to lowering the age limit to 18 is a good thing. And I think it's a smart thing that they should have never raised it in the first place.\\n\\nAnd once again, I think, when you're looking at this - obviously, you can look at this from an amateur standpoint that the - this is another example that amateurism in the college game has to go. It's not - especially because the irony of this, Scott, is that Mike Krzyzewski, he's the one who controls the shoe contract for the players. So the players have to wear his shoe, he makes the money off of it, and they risk the injury and have no recourse.\\n\\nSIMON: Oh, mercy. And I wonder - I - does Coach Krzyzewski even wear Nikes on the sidelines? He usually wears a suit, right?\\n\\nBRYANT: Yeah, but those checks cash, that's for certain. And so Zion Williamson has an $8 million insurance policy now. The bottom line is that this has to change, and the NBA should do its part. If you're good enough to play in the league, go play in the league.\\n\\nSIMON: Howard Bryant of ESPN The Magazine and espn.com. Yeah, I mean, ballet dancers, right? They - you know, nobody says to them one and done. Howard Bryant, thanks very much for being with us.\\n\\nBRYANT: Thank you, Scott.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ERIC VLOEIMANS AND GATECRASH'S PICCOLO DAVID)\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "NFL's Conduct Policy In Spotlight Again Over Kicker's Admitted Spousal Abuse\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tom Canavan/AP Tom Canavan/AP\\n\\nThe NFL's New York Giants are heading to London for a game against the Los Angeles Rams this Sunday, without their All-Pro kicker Josh Brown.\\n\\nThe decision to leave Brown behind comes after new information emerged in a year-and-a-half-old domestic violence case. And suddenly, there are new questions about whether the league adheres to its supposedly tougher policy against domestic violence.\\n\\nIn May 2015, Brown was arrested for assaulting his then-wife Molly at their home in Washington state. Brown wasn't charged.\\n\\nThe league conducted its own investigation to determine whether Brown had violated the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy. That policy allows for discipline to be imposed even when criminal charges are not presented.\\n\\nThe policy was toughened after the Ray Rice scandal in 2014. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote the following in a letter to team owners in August of that year:\\n\\nEffective immediately, violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force, will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant.\\n\\nIn August of this year, the league announced in a statement that Mr. Brown had violated the Personal Conduct Policy. And then suspended him.\\n\\nFor one game.\\n\\nI have physically abused my wife.\\n\\nBrown served his suspension, and since then, he's been one of this season's best kickers, making 11 of 12 field goals and all nine of the Giants' points after touchdowns.\\n\\nBut now Brown's season is in limbo, as new revelations are prompting questions about the Giants' and the NFL's handling of the case.\\n\\nWednesday night, law enforcement officials in Washington state released documents that included an admission by Brown that he had abused his wife.\\n\\nOne document was titled, Josh Brown – Contract for Change. It was dated March 28, 2013, more than two years before his assault arrest; it was drafted as part of marriage counseling he was then undergoing.\\n\\nBrown wrote:\\n\\nI have physically, verbally and emotionally abused my wife Molly. I have controlled her by making her feel less human than me, and manipulated her with money. I have constantly made her feel as if she is not good enough for me to hide my own insecurities and self hate.\\n\\nBrown's admission prompted this statement from the NFL on Thursday: In light of the release of these documents we will thoroughly review the additional information and determine next steps in the context of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy.\\n\\nOrigins of the tougher NFL policy\\n\\nThe NFL's actions with Brown are reminiscent of how it handled Rice's notorious case two years ago, when the league responded to the first reports of Rice's elevator assault on his then-fiancee with a two-game suspension.\\n\\nLater, explosive security camera video emerged of the Baltimore Ravens running back knocking out his fiancee with a hard cross to her jaw and dragging her unconscious from the elevator. Rice was released by his team, then banned indefinitely from the NFL before being reinstated. No team has signed him since.\\n\\nThe crisis led Goodell to issue tougher league rules concerning domestic violence, including the six-game suspension penalty.\\n\\nWhich raises the question why Brown was suspended for only one game.\\n\\nWho knew what, when?\\n\\nThe Brown case raises the same questions that surrounded the Rice scandal: about what the NFL — and the player's team — knew about the player's conduct.\\n\\nThe NFL didn't respond to NPR's request for an interview on Thursday. But in a statement, the league said this:\\n\\nNFL investigators made repeated attempts — both orally and in writing — to obtain any and all evidence and relevant information in this case from the King County [Washington] Sheriff's Office. Each of those requests was denied and the Sheriff's Office declined to provide any of the requested information, which ultimately limited our ability to fully investigate this matter. We concluded our own investigation, more than a year after the initial incident, based on the facts and evidence available to us at the time and after making exhaustive attempts to obtain information in a timely fashion. It is unfortunate that we did not have the benefit or knowledge of these materials [the documents released Wednesday] at the time.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the King County Sheriff's Office, Sgt. Cindi West, says someone requested documents in May 2015, shortly after Brown's arrest, but didn't initially identify himself as an investigator for the NFL. West said in any event the information was withheld because the investigation into Brown was open and active.\\n\\nThe NFL acknowledges it learned in the course of its investigation that Molly Brown made allegations of other instances of abuse by her then-husband.\\n\\nAnd West says the NFL did receive a number of documents in August of this year, which included the transcript of a lengthy interview Brown's wife gave investigators shortly after the incident, in which she alleged at least 20 instances of abuse over several years.\\n\\nBut the NFL says Molly Brown declined to speak with league investigators, and thus they had insufficient information to corroborate her allegations.\\n\\nHowever, on Thursday, New York Giants co-owner John Mara told radio station WFAN New York that Brown certainly admitted to us that he abused his wife in the past.\\n\\nAnd Mara said he knew of an incident at the January 2016 Pro Bowl in Hawaii — the NFL's all-star game — when the NFL reportedly had to help Molly Brown and her three children find a different place to stay after she felt threatened by her husband at the player's hotel.\\n\\nThe Giants re-signed Brown to a two-year, $4 million contract this spring. According to USA Today, Mara said the team never spoke to Molly Brown before re-signing Josh.\\n\\nThe Giants released a statement Thursday saying:\\n\\nIn light of the news reports regarding the documents released by the State of Washington yesterday, we think it makes sense to review this newly disclosed information and to revisit this issue following our trip to London. The Giants do not condone or excuse any form of domestic violence. Josh has acknowledged that he has issues in his life and has been working on these issues through therapy and counseling for a long period of time. We remain supportive of Josh and his efforts.\\n\\nWest of the King County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that charges were never brought against Brown because his wife is uncomfortable testifying. West says that's not uncommon in domestic violence cases.\\n\\nWhat I'm comfortable saying on her behalf, says West, is that her children are her priority. She knows this case is going to get a lot of public attention, and she wants to keep her children's lives as normal as possible. That's one of the reasons she decided not to testify.\\n\\nBut left unanswered is whether the case of Josh Brown serves as an indictment of a league that appeared to learn its lesson two years ago, but in fact didn't."}
{"original": "FBI Vows To Warn More Election Officials If Discovering A Cyberattack\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. David Ake/AP J. David Ake/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 6:15 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe FBI says it plans to warn state and local election officials if it discovers cyberattacks this year. It hopes the new policy will build new bridges to more authorities involved with election security.\\n\\nThe federal government has been criticized for poor communication with election officials during and since the Russian attack on the presidential election in 2016.\\n\\nIf the FBI discovered that a cyberattack had successfully breached a local election system, the old policy meant the bureau would tell that county, for example, but not the state government.\\n\\nIn Florida, for instance, two counties were breached in 2016, but state officials weren't briefed on the matter until roughly two years later.\\n\\nThis chaotic dribs and drabs of information that's coming out is doing more harm to our constituents' faith in the electoral system than just coming out and providing some information, said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat who represents Florida's 7th District, last year.\\n\\nThat practice stemmed from a broader policy of the FBI that was intended to protect the identities of crime victims — even if the victim, in this case, was a government entity.\\n\\nNow, the FBI says it plans to alert the top election official in the state in which a cyberattack occurred at roughly the same time as it alerts the county that was breached.\\n\\nIt is the intent of the FBI that this new policy will result in increased collaboration between all levels of government for the integrity and security of U.S. elections, the bureau said in a statement.\\n\\nColorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner welcomed the announcement in a joint statement on Thursday evening.\\n\\nFederal, state, and local governments must work together to better detect and protect against cyber-attack, the secretaries of state said.\\n\\nWe've already seen positive results from the partnership between our states, which strengthens our resilience from attacks and ensures voters across this nation will have the confidence they deserve as they cast their ballot this year.\\n\\nFormer Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller documented a broad wave of active measures that targeted the 2016 presidential election, including cyberattacks focusing on U.S. election infrastructure.\\n\\nMueller and other national security officials have warned that they expect election interference to continue through the 2020 race and likely beyond."}
{"original": "Employers Fear GOP Health Overhaul Could Damage Job-Based Insurance\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images\\n\\nThrough years of acrimony over the relative merits of Obamacare, one kind of health insurance has remained steady, widespread and relatively affordable: Employer-sponsored plans.\\n\\nJob-based medical plans still cover more Americans than any other type, typically with greater benefits and lower out-of-pocket expense. Recent cost increases for this sort of coverage have been a tiny fraction of those for Obamacare plans for individuals.\\n\\nNow, as President Donald Trump promises a replacement for the Affordable Care Act that will provide insurance for everybody, employers worry Republican attempts to redo other parts of the insurance market could harm their much larger one.\\n\\nWe're deeply embedded in the health law, said Neil Trautwein, vice president of health care policy for the National Retail Federation, a trade group. Pick your analogy — it's like being tied to the railroad tracks or having a bomb strapped across your chest. It's tough to disarm these things.\\n\\nBusinesses dislike many parts of the ACA, including its substantial paperwork, the mandate to offer coverage and the Cadillac tax on high-benefit plans (which is set to take effect in 2020). But large companies in particular — those that have always offered job-based insurance — say a poorly thought-out replacement might turn out to be worse for them and their workers.\\n\\nWhatever the Republicans are going to do, they've got to make it look as different from the ACA as they can for political reasons, said Edward Fensholt, a senior benefits lawyer at Lockton Companies, a large insurance broker. There are some pieces that aren't broken, and the more you ... make something different from the ACA, the more you risk screwing up things that look OK.\\n\\nAny new health law would need substantial revenue to replace the Cadillac tax and the other ACA taxes on health insurers, medical devices and high-income households that paid for care expansion — assuming those measures are repealed. Otherwise, a replacement plan risks stranding the millions who are now getting government-subsidized Obamacare coverage.\\n\\nLeaders in big business worry that Republicans may be tempted to limit the exemption from income and payroll taxes that job-based coverage has enjoyed for decades. Taxing workers and employers for health benefits could raise billions to pay for a replacement plan.\\n\\nSuch a measure has occasionally been floated by Republicans since the days of President Ronald Reagan, often under the argument of leveling the field between employer plans and other coverage that the tax code treats far less generously.\\n\\nRepublicans still don't agree on what a replacement for Obamacare should look like.\\n\\nBut capping the tax exclusion for employer plans is in replacement legislation introduced by Rep. Tom Price, the Georgia Republican poised to become secretary of Health and Human Services. It's also in House Speaker Paul Ryan's Better Way plan. A third proposal would keep the ACA taxes.\\n\\nDepending on how it's structured, limiting the employer-plan loophole could add hundreds of dollars to workers' tax bills as a portion of their expensive health insurance is counted as taxable income.\\n\\nI can't understand why nobody has asked the president about this, said James Gelfand, the top health policy official at ERIC, a lobbying group of very large employers focused on benefits and pay. Taxing employer insurance to subsidize non-employer insurance, he said, is a 100 percent redistribution of wealth.\\n\\nBig business has a vested interest in that argument. A tax on health benefits would be a pay cut for its workers. Corporate payroll taxes would also rise if the value of worker health benefits counted toward required employer contributions to Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nBut other, independent health policy analysts share the concern.\\n\\nTaxing medical benefits could spur employers to erode or drop those benefits and make workers less likely to accept them, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\\n\\nMore concerning, Levitt said, are proposals such as Price's that could give workers who now rely on company health plans the option of instead using tax credits to buy individual coverage outside their company's plan. While offering workers more choice — a Republican goal — it would also erode the ACA's firewall that protects employer coverage from market turbulence.\\n\\nThere could be much more movement from employer coverage to individual plans, especially among younger and healthier workers, Levitt said.\\n\\nThat could, Fensholt said, leave company plans with the same adverse selection problem experienced by many individual plans now sold via Obamacare's online marketplaces — too high a percentage of members who are older, sicker and more expensive.\\n\\nWhat the administration and Congress must do immediately is stabilize the individual insurance marketplace and not destabilize the employer marketplace, said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which advocates for large companies.\\n\\nJob-based coverage has remained stable even as annual increases in insurance premiums for individual plans reached double-digit percentages and enrollments missed expectations, pressuring the health insurance market despite the support of government subsidies.\\n\\nEmployer health plans cover some 150 million people, while last year individual plans covered about 20 million, according to Mark Farrah Associates, a data firm. That included some 10 million who bought coverage through the health law's subsidized exchanges.\\n\\nThe portion of non-elderly Americans covered by employer-sponsored plans has stayed almost unchanged since the health law was passed.\\n\\nRecent premium increases for job-based plans have been below 5 percent on average, less than the historical trend and far lower on average than premium hikes for individual insurance. Employers still pay most of the premium.\\n\\nOne way companies have contained premiums is by shifting to high-deductible plans, in which the insurance covers little until workers have incurred thousands in medical bills. Even so, benefits in employer plans are generally richer than those in the average individual plan, say health policy analysts.\\n\\nIn the contentious political climate, executives at individual companies were reluctant to be interviewed for this story. More than a half dozen employers declined to comment.\\n\\nBut there is enormous interest and concern, among business executives who specialize in health benefits, in what a Republican plan might look like. A post-election session on repeal and replacement aimed at these executives drew the biggest webinar audience ever for the National Business Group on Health, said Steve Wojcik, the advocacy and research group's vice president of public policy.\\n\\nIf the executives attending that webinar were anything like the benefits analysts at the American Staffing Association, a trade group that advocates for temp and recruiting firms, they had some catching up to do.\\n\\nEdward Lenz, senior counsel for the ASA, said that before Donald Trump's election, we ignored lots of the talk of the Republicans about repeal. First of all there was no chance of that happening with the president [Obama] in the White House. And frankly no one here counted on President Trump's victory.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

{"original": "Brexit Fallout: Anxious Immigrants, Backtracking Politicians\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\\n\\nSandy Berart sat in the shade of a birch tree eating a very British lunch – a cheddar cheese and pickle sandwich — and wondered what lay in store for her in the city she calls home.\\n\\nThe first thought I had is, 'Am I going to be able to stay and work freely?' asked Berart, 41, an assistant office manager from France who works in London's Southwark neighborhood, a hub for architectural, design and engineering firms south of the River Thames.\\n\\nShe was describing her reaction to last week's surprise vote to leave the European Union. Berart, who has lived in Britain for 19 years, doesn't expect to be deported, but she's anxious about what a new immigration system will look like.\\n\\nWill the government force her to get a work permit? Will it overload companies with so much paperwork that employing foreigners like her will become too onerous?\\n\\nIn the wake of last week's so-called Brexit vote, EU immigrants in the U.K. are worried.\\n\\nIt's a time of uncertainty for a lot of people, said Madeleine Sumption, who runs the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. Sumption says more than 2 million people born in EU nations work in the U.K. But contrary to many fears, she doesn't think the government will throw most of them out.\\n\\nThe central estimate is that 100 percent of people who are already here would be able to stay, said Sumption. She expects there will be some cutoff date after which new rules will apply. The reason for that is when the U.K. government introduces new immigration rules they tend to apply only to people who haven't yet arrived.\\n\\nAs immigrants worry, some pro-Brexit politicians are lowering expectations for what they'll actually be able to accomplish on immigration. Some seem to be backtracking on pledges to significantly cut the flow of immigrants, which is what many who voted to leave the EU last Thursday want.\\n\\nSome people thought the immigrants would be on the boat the following day, said Peter Catterall, who teaches history at the University of Westminster.\\n\\nIn order to keep access to the hugely valuable European market, some Brexiteers say the U.K. will have to allow the free movement of workers from the European Union. When anti-immigration voters realize they won't get what they were promised, Catterall thinks they will become angrier and more disaffected.\\n\\nThey're already feeling that people aren't listening to them, said Catterall, that the people in metropolitan London, these experts who talk down to them, aren't listening to their problems. The risk is you move from increasing cynicism towards democracy to listening to demagogues.\\n\\nSo how will Brexiteers address the immigration issue they ran and won on?\\n\\nThe former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the current favorite to become Britain's next prime minister, has suggested the U.K. adopt an immigration system used in Australia that would allot points to EU migrants based on their skills, including level of English.\\n\\nBut Khanh Hoang, who teaches in the Migration Law Program at Australian National University, says pro-Brexit politicians don't seem to really understand the Australian model.\\n\\nIf you kind of look closer at what the points test does, it's not actually a tool to limit migration at all, said Hoang.\\n\\nHe said the points-based system tries to match immigrants to labor needs as determined by the government, but the approach has had problems. Some immigrants claim skills they don't have. And, Hoang says, the government's estimates of needs haven't always been accurate.\\n\\nYou could have people who meet the points test, and they come into Australia and there is no work for them because the shortages in those areas aren't exactly what the government thought they were, said Hoang.\\n\\nHoang says immigration can be an effective wedge issue for winning political campaigns in different parts of the world, as the Brexit effort has shown. Designing and running an immigration policy that works, he says, is trickier."}
{"original": "Who Will Be Trump's, Clinton's Vice President?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP\\n\\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are turning their attention to the general election and to one of the most important decisions they will make — choosing a vice president.\\n\\nPicking a vice president is the first presidential level decision any candidate makes. Although vice presidential candidates have rarely, perhaps never, determined the outcome of an election, the choice tells voters a lot about the candidate.\\n\\nThe two most important criteria are always the same:\\n\\n1. Pick someone who would ready to be president, if necessary, and\\n\\n2. DO NO HARM\\n\\nHere's a look at the potential VP short lists for Clinton and Trump. For the purposes of this exercise, we will restrict the names to those who have indicated they would be open to the possibility or at least have not ruled out joining the ticket.\\n\\nTrump\\n\\nThe Republican has an unusual VP search, because so many prominent Republicans have ruled out joining his ticket. But he still has plenty of eager running mates to choose from. Trump told the AP this week that he has narrowed his search to five or six people. He has said he would like someone with political and legislative experience to help him deal with Congress, and he has also said he would consider some of his former rivals. Here are three categories the potential picks fall in (bolded are possible vice presidential picks):\\n\\n1. Former opponents\\n\\nBoth Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal have endorsed Trump. Both are former governors. But Trump will probably win Texas and Louisiana without them.\\n\\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one of Trump's earliest establishment endorsers, and Trump has asked him to lead his transition team. Christie's in-your-face, tough-talking style is a lot like Trump's. If being an attack dog is a top requirement for a VP candidate then Christie's evisceration of Marco Rubio is a qualification/recommendation. Then again, Trump usually takes care of those duties himself.\\n\\nJohn Kasich, Ted Cruz and Rubio all fit Trump's criteria, though Rubio has ruled it out and it's hard to see Kasich or Cruz on the ticket after their previous brutal fights with Trump.\\n\\n2. Members of Congress — current and former\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich knows something about running against the establishment. He has made it clear he would be happy to be on the ticket.\\n\\nBob Corker, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman and former businessman, has lavished praise on Trump for his recent foreign policy speech and has said he wouldn't rule out the VP slot.\\n\\n3. The woman's card\\n\\nTrump said this week he might consider Jan Brewer, the former governor of Arizona, who shares his position on immigration, or Joni Ernst, a freshman senator elected with Tea Party support. Ernst has been critical of Trump's comments about women, but she hasn't ruled out taking the VP spot. Trump's negatives with women are sky high. A woman on the ticket might help. Plus, Ernst is from the swing state of Iowa.\\n\\nClinton\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP\\n\\nThe Democrat, like Trump, is already vetting VP candidates, and her possible picks fall into three categories:\\n\\n1. Swing-state senators\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeffrey Collins/AP Jeffrey Collins/AP\\n\\nSherrod Brown from Ohio says he is not interested but hasn't made a Shermanesque statement ruling out the VP spot. He could be helpful if Clinton needs support in the important battleground state of Ohio. Brown is a great communicator who does well with the kind of white, blue-collar voters who have voted for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. (Plus, Brown has a wife who won a Pulitzer Prize.) One potential downside — if Clinton wins, a Republican governor would fill Brown's vacant Ohio seat.\\n\\nThen there's Tim Kaine, who has been an effective, if not very charismatic, surrogate for Clinton. He is from Virginia, an important battleground state for Democrats, and speaks fluent Spanish.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nati Harnik/AP Nati Harnik/AP\\n\\n2. Hispanic Cabinet secretaries\\n\\nJulian Castro is the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He is also the former mayor of San Antonio and a telegenic, young Mexican-American. Tom Perez, the labor secretary, is Dominican-American. Both could help Clinton with Hispanic voters, if she decides Trump isn't helping her enough there already.\\n\\n3. Play another woman card, or base card\\n\\nElizabeth Warren is the heroine of the progressive left. She could help Clinton bring in Sanders voters, if Clinton decides that she (and Trump) can't do that alone. Warren has also shown she has the stomach for a bare-knuckle brawl with Trump. She has been engaged in a Twitter war with the likely Republican nominee. He calls her Goofy Elizabeth Warren, and she calls him a narcissist and a racist.\\n\\nWelcome to General Election 2016!"}
{"original": "Plutonium Shortage Could Stall Space Exploration\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos National Laboratory\\n\\nNASA is running out of the special kind of plutonium needed to power deep space probes, worrying planetary scientists who say the U. S. urgently needs to restart production of plutonium-238.\\n\\nBut it's unclear whether Congress will provide the $30 million that the administration requested earlier this year for the Department of Energy to get a new program going.\\n\\nNuclear weapons use plutonium-239, but NASA depends on something quite different: plutonium-238. A marshmallow-sized pellet of plutonium-238, encased in metal, gives off a lot of heat.\\n\\nIf you dim the lights a little bit, it glows a little red, because it's very hot, says Stephen Johnson, director of space nuclear systems and technologies at the Idaho National Laboratory.\\n\\nAll that heat can be converted into electricity. And this electricity is very, very useful, when you're in a remote or a hostile environment, says Johnson, such as when you're in space and when you're too far away from sun to use solar power.\\n\\nSupplies Are Dwindling\\n\\nNearly two dozen space missions have been powered by plutonium-238, including famous ones such as the Voyager probes in the 1970s, the Galileo probe that orbited Jupiter, and the Cassini spacecraft that is currently sending back images of Saturn's rings and moons. Spacecraft powered by plutonium-238 have revealed odd wonders of the solar system, like volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and methane lakes on Saturn's moon Titan.\\n\\nBut stores of plutonium-238 are running low, because the production of this man-made material was a byproduct of Cold War activities, and the U.S. has not made any new supplies since the 1980s.\\n\\nWe've been living off of the material that we had produced up until that time, and if you keep using material and you have a finite supply, eventually you run out, and that's where we are right now, says Ralph McNutt, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\\n\\nFor a while, the U.S. purchased plutonium-238 from Russia. But Russia's production facilities were also shut down long ago, and now Russia has run out, too.\\n\\nAccording to McNutt, NASA has enough plutonium-238 for its next Mars rover, called the Mars Science Laboratory, and the next planned major mission to the outer planets.\\n\\nThe agency could also potentially have a relatively low-cost, Discovery-class mission that would use only a small amount of the stuff, to test a new power-generation technology that could more efficiently convert the heat of plutonium-238 to electricity.\\n\\nBut that's about it, and after that, NASA would be stuck, McNutt says. It's kind of like having a car, and if all the gasoline stations are closed and are out of gasoline, and you're out of gas, he says, you're not going to go anywhere.\\n\\nWithout This Plutonium, Expect Delays\\n\\nNASA could still explore places close enough to the sun for solar power to work. But for going far out into space, there is no substitute for plutonium-238, because of its unique properties.\\n\\nThere isn't any other option, says McNutt, who was co-chairman of a National Research Council committee that released a report on this issue in May. That report said the shortage has already forced NASA to delay some missions and limit others.\\n\\nAnd even if the Department of Energy restarts production now, it would still take about eight years to ramp up to making the 11 pounds or so needed by NASA each year.\\n\\nRestarting production would be expensive, the report said — likely in excess of $150 million — but unless action is taken, NASA could find itself without needed supplies a decade from now.\\n\\nThis report seemed to get people's attention. The administration's budget request for the Department of Energy for fiscal year 2010 included $30 million to move toward new production.\\n\\nFor us, that was a major step forward. A very positive thing, for both NASA and Department of Energy, says Hal Bell, director for the advanced planning and analysis division in the Office of the Chief Engineer at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Previously, we had not seen that level of commitment.\\n\\nWaiting For Congress To Decide\\n\\nBut as an appropriations bill made its way through Congress over the summer, the Senate knocked the amount to zero. And the House lowered it to just $10 million.\\n\\nThe White House issued a statement of administration policy in July urging Congress to give the requested funds for restarting domestic production, saying it's essential for planned NASA missions as well as national security applications.\\n\\nPlanetary scientists can now only wait to see what happens. Less money would mean more delay. It really is the kind of thing where people will wake up 10 years from now and say, 'What were they thinking?'  says Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado and chief scientist for NASA's New Horizons probe.\\n\\nRight now, the New Horizons spacecraft is out past Saturn, headed to Pluto.

{"original": "A Little-Known Climate Fund Is Suddenly In The Spotlight\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anton Petrus/Getty Images Anton Petrus/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Green Climate Fund has been thrust into the spotlight of late.\\n\\nPresident Trump singled it out for scorn in his Rose Garden remarks last week announcing his decision to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Along with that move, Trump noted, he is ending further U.S. contributions to the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name.\\n\\nAdvocates for the environment have countered with op-eds in defense of the fund. Even comedian John Oliver jumped into the fray. In his Sunday night HBO show, Oliver offered a point-by-point rebuttal of numerous incorrect statements that Trump made about the fund, including the erroneous claim that the GCF, which is funded through voluntary contributions, would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars.\\n\\nYet it seems a fair guess that most people remain hazy on what the Green Climate Fund actually is — not the least because the GCF is so green in the other sense of that word: It's only just getting off the ground.\\n\\nSo herewith we present seven facts you might not know about GCF and its mission:\\n\\n1) The GCF was created to exclusively serve low- and middle-income countries.\\n\\nSpecifically, its mandate is to help developing countries reduce their emissions — so as to prevent further climate change — and adapt to the effects of climate change already occurring as a result of worldwide emissions. This includes supporting projects to build sea walls on the island nation of Tuvalu, create an early warning network to alert farmers in Malawi to floods and other disasters, launch energy companies that will provide rural people in East Africa with solar power, and encourage investment in renewal energy companies in Argentina.\\n\\n2) The GCF is pretty new. But it's older than the Paris Agreement.\\n\\nFive years older, to be precise. The GCF was formally created at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico. That said, setting up an international organization of the GCF's scope and size takes time. So it wasn't until 2013 that the GCF was in a position to hold its first round of fundraising.\\n\\nForty-three countries pledged a total of $10.3 billion to get the ball rolling for the first several years — though no exact time period was specified for how long that money is supposed to last. So far, the GCF has committed $2.2 billion to 43 projects.\\n\\n3) A lot of the money for the Green Climate Fund is supposed to come from rich countries ...\\n\\nThe GCF was created as a vehicle to carry out one of the major commitments made by developed countries at the 2010 Cancun meeting: By 2020, they promised to mobilize $100 billion every year for climate change efforts in developing countries.\\n\\n4) ... but mostly this is about bringing in private funding.\\n\\nMobilize — that's the key word here, says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the U.S. Treasury in the Obama administration. The term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. The plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.\\n\\nThe GCF is designed to do this in a range of ways, says Martinez-Diaz, who is now global director of the Sustainable Finance Center at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. For example, if a private company is leery of investing in climate projects because of political and financial risks, the GCF will offer it loans, loan guarantees, or other forms of insurance.\\n\\n5) The GCF has what one green researcher calls a special sauce that similar organizations lack.\\n\\nMartinez-Diaz notes that the GCF was never meant to be the only channel for mobilizing the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised would flow annually to poor countries by 2020. Not even as an intermediary or pass-through, he says. It was meant to be one of several financing mechanisms. Other examples include multilateral development banks like the World Bank.\\n\\nBut the GCF has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes Jessica Brown of the Climate Policy Initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. The World Bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. The bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. And it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. The GCF faces no such constraints.\\n\\nIn contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the GCF also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. The GCF was set up within the umbrella of the United Nations system expressly for this purpose. And its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says Brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the U.S. State Department.\\n\\nThese two features are the special sauce that GCF can offer, says Brown.\\n\\n6) Trump's decision to end further U.S. funding deals the organization a blow — but doesn't necessarily kneecap it.\\n\\nOf the $10.3 billion that donor countries pledged to the GCF during that initial fundraising round back in 2013, the U.S. promised $3 billion. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has already handed over $1 billion in two installments of $500 million. The last one was disbursed in January, just before Obama left office. (The money is paid out of a general State Department fund over which the president has broad discretion).\\n\\nTrump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the GCF's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. And various analysts say the loss of U.S. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the U.S. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.\\n\\nBut while Trump claimed in his speech that he had terminated the GCF, Melanie Nakagawa, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy transformation at the U.S. Department of State under Obama, notes that the $1 billion that the U.S. did provide is already in the system. The check is in and it is already having an impact.\\n\\nThe GCF estimates that the 43 projects for which it has started to disburse funds will impact a total of 128 million people. And it still has more than $6 billion left to disburse. During the initial fundraising round in 2013, the GCF agreed not to start its next round until it had allocated 60 percent of the money it had raised in the first. Though no timeline was set, many people expected this would take four to five years.\\n\\nNow that the GCF will have less money, that date will presumably come sooner — some say as soon as 2018, notes Brown, though she thinks it will be longer than that.\\n\\nAnd Nakagawa says it's entirely possible that by the time the GCF is in need of its next cash infusion, it could find better favor from the U.S. Four years from now, another administration could decide to put the money in, she says.\\n\\n7) The world is still a long way from mobilizing $100 billion in annual spending on climate change challenges in developing countries.\\n\\nBack when world leaders agreed to the $100 billion goal, it wasn't actually clear how much the developed world was currently spending. The only really good data we have is starting in 2014, says Martinez-Diaz. That's from a 2015 analysis by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Climate Policy Initiative. And it's not very promising: It finds that the public and private sectors combined spent about $62 billion."}
{"original": "FACT CHECK: Have Immigrants Lowered Wages For Blue-Collar American Workers?\\n\\nEnlarge this image Branden Camp/AP Branden Camp/AP\\n\\nPresident Trump's senior policy adviser Stephen Miller had a tense exchange with reporters at Wednesday's press briefing as he defended the administration's new proposal to dramatically curtail legal immigration. The plan prioritizes highly skilled workers over family members for green cards.\\n\\nThe administration reasons that too many low-skilled immigrant workers are entering the country, costing Americans jobs and wages.\\n\\nMiller said the U.S. has, in recent years, issued green cards without regard to whether an immigrant can pay their own way or be reliant on welfare, or whether they'll displace or take a job from an American worker.\\n\\nCalling a green card the golden ticket of immigration, Miller said Trump's proposal puts the needs of the working class ahead of the investor class.\\n\\nWe're protecting blue-collar workers, he said.\\n\\nThe claim:\\n\\nWe've seen significant reductions in wages for blue-collar workers, massive displacement of African-American and Hispanic workers, as well as the displacement of immigrant workers from previous years who oftentimes compete directly against new arrivals who are being paid even less, Stephen Miller said.\\n\\nMiller went on to say the numbers of low-skilled [immigrant] workers in particular is a major detriment to U.S. workers.\\n\\nThe question:\\n\\nHave immigrants taken jobs from and lowered wages for American blue-collar workers?\\n\\nThe short answer:\\n\\nEconomists disagree whether or how much an influx of immigrants depresses wages. Some have found that new immigrants depress wages for certain groups, such as teenagers or workers with a high school diploma or less. Others say the overall effect on the economy is tiny, and an influx of immigrant workers vitalizes the economy overall.\\n\\nEither way, the forces driving wage reductions for blue-collar workers go far beyond immigration.\\n\\nThe long answer:\\n\\nIt is true that wages for low-wage workers have declined — they fell 5 percent from 1979 to 2013. That may not seem like a huge drop, but during that same period, the hourly wages of high-wage workers rose 41 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nHowever, economists disagree over whether an influx of immigrant labor caused or contributed to declining blue-collar jobs and wages.\\n\\nAsked to provide a study that supported the administration's assertion, Stephen Miller cited work from George Borjas, a Harvard labor economist, on how the Mariel boatlift affected blue-collar wages in Miami. In 1980, 125,000 Cuban immigrants came to the U.S., mostly Miami, from the town of Mariel.\\n\\nBorjas, Miller said, went back and re-examined and opened up the old data, and talked about how it actually did reduce wages for workers who were living there at the time.\\n\\nBorjas' new analysis found that the wages of high school dropouts in Miami dropped between 10-30 percent after the refugee influx (the analysis looked at 1977 to 1993).\\n\\nBut an earlier study on the boatlift, from 1990 by Princeton economist David Card, looked at wages of less-skilled workers overall (as opposed to just high school dropouts) and found virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier.\\n\\nThe debate remains unsettled, and it's impossible to extrapolate the effect of the boatlift on Miami to the whole country.\\n\\nA recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis called the inflow of foreign-born people a relatively minor factor in the $18 trillion U.S. economy. However, the analysis does cite recent research that immigration could reduce the number of hours worked by teenagers and some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.\\n\\nThere are, of course, other forces that have depressed blue-collar wages: increased automation, globalization, declining unionization and government policies on overtime. The Trump administration recently said it would not defend an Obama-era rule that made workers who make less than $47,000 per year (up from about $24,000) eligible for overtime.\\n\\nNot just about economics\\n\\nThe politics of the bill reach beyond economics. At Wednesday's briefing, Miller was also asked to defend the fact that the bill prioritizes English-speaking immigrants. Miller, along with adviser Steve Bannon, have led an ethnonationalist wing at the White House. Bannon has complained about the number of Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley, implying that they are adversarial to America's civic society.\\n\\nAre we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia? CNN's Jim Acosta asked.\\n\\nThe notion that you think this is a racist bill is so wrong and so insulting, Miller answered, adding that the country's foreign-born population into the U.S. has quadrupled since 1970.\\n\\nWhile Miller is correct that the foreign-born population has increased, in 1970 the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S. was the lowest in a century. The share of the population that's foreign born today is about the same as the late 1800s and early 1900s, according to the U.S. Census.\\n\\nNow what?\\n\\nIt is important to note that Trump's plan would have a steep uphill battle to get through this Congress. Still, not surprisingly, there is also debate around how Trump's drastic proposal will affect blue-collar wages moving forward. The Trump administration hopes the plan will free up future jobs for American low-wage workers. But Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, who has advised John McCain and donated to McCain and Hillary Clinton's campaigns, told Politico the plan is a mistake that will cause the labor force to come to a standstill in the next decade. It is hard to imagine a policy that would do more damage to long-term economic growth, he said.\\n\\nAs NPR's Brian Naylor noted, economists believe the country's low unemployment rate (4.4 percent) coupled with retiring baby boomers will result in a labor shortage in the coming years.\\n\\nAdditionally, an open letter signed by 1,470 economists argued that the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh their costs, and smart immigration policy could better maximize the benefits of immigration while reducing the costs.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, President Trump praised highly skilled workers, which his plan now prioritizes — but studies are also mixed on whether those workers positively impact wages or also depress the wages of American-born workers.\\n\\nScott Horsley and Shaheen Ainpour contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Diaries Offer Candid View Of Reagan's World\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Ronald Reagan Library Courtesy Ronald Reagan Library\\n\\nRonald Reagan kept a diary nearly every day that he was president of the United States. The Reagan Diaries Unabridged goes on sale nationwide Tuesday.\\n\\nBut some of the late president's most devoted fans were able to get an early start on the two-volume extravaganza by purchasing them at the only place they're available this week: the gift shop of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.\\n\\nEveryone waiting patiently in line outside the library gift shop looked old enough to have voted for the Republican icon when he ran for president in 1980 — or even when he ran for governor of California in 1966.\\n\\nWe're great admirers of President Reagan, said Jan Grossenbacher, who was visiting the library. She and her husband, Gale, already own the abridged version of the late president's diaries that came out a few years ago.\\n\\nSo this makes it complete, Gale Grossenbacher said. He said he expects more detail in the unabridged version.\\n\\nReagan's Unvarnished Look At World Leaders\\n\\nHistorian Douglas Brinkley, the editor of both the abridged and unabridged editions, said the diaries show Reagan much more engaged and hands-on than previously supposed. In the unabridged version, Brinkley said, Reagan also offers his unvarnished look at people ranging from Pope John Paul to Mother Teresa to Mikhail Gorbachev.\\n\\nReagan thought [Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon of Israel was a thug. He didn't like him, which surprises a lot of people. He was terrified to meet Mother Teresa, and really had a special relationship with the pope, Brinkley said.\\n\\nDomestically, Brinkley said, one of Reagan's guiding lights was his vice president, George H.W. Bush. He provided much more policy advice than previously thought, Brinkley says. What comes out of this is that Reagan was a conservative, but a pragmatic conservative — not an ideologue.\\n\\nAnd Reagan was something else that has been rare in Republican circles these days: successful and widely beloved. That's why recent Republican candidates have invoked his name at every opportunity.\\n\\nLessons For Current Republicans?\\n\\nAs Douglas Brinkley sat behind an ornate wooden desk signing the Reagan diaries, the people waiting their turn said today's Republicans could learn a lot from Ronald Reagan. There was less unanimity on exactly what that was.\\n\\nAccording to Ed Woodson, Republicans should focus on a strong national defense and values.\\n\\nThat's what we need in the country today, Woodson said.\\n\\nLisa Tyson said Reagan would tell current office holders to step up to the plate and think of the broader future of the country. She complains that there is a lot of nitpicking in politics nowadays.\\n\\nI don't think we get things done, Tyson said.\\n\\nAnd Randy Schell wants the Republican Party to get back to basics. He criticized the current party leaders who talk about reinventing the party.\\n\\nJust get back to core beliefs, Schell advised.\\n\\nEveryone at the book signing seemed to be looking for the key to success that has lately eluded Republicans — and hoping that somewhere in his two-volume diary, Reagan reveals the secret."}
{"original": "Immigration Attorney Discusses How Shutdown Is Affecting Backlog Of Cases\\n\\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks with Jeremy McKinney, an attorney with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, about how the government shutdown is affecting the large backlog of immigration cases.\\n\\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump says his border wall is a fix for the country's broken immigration system, but the standoff to fund that wall has shuttered the very courts tasked with hearing immigration cases. Some immigrants have waited years for a court appearance. And until the partial shutdown ends, they'll keep on waiting indefinitely. Jeremy McKinney is an immigration attorney. He's also a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nJEREMY MCKINNEY: Thank you very much.\\n\\nCORNISH: So how are you explaining this shutdown to your clients? Because I assume some aren't familiar with U.S. policy, may not know what's going on.\\n\\nMCKINNEY: The way that we've explained it is to say that, due to the government shutdown, only detained cases are being heard. But there is a unprecedented backlog of about 800,000 cases before the immigration court. And so right now, the courts are only hearing a little more than 5 percent of cases that they could hear during this shutdown.\\n\\nCORNISH: Well, let me jump in here. So is this the phone call that's like, hey, Jeremy - a panic? Or is it like - what do these call sound like?\\n\\nMCKINNEY: These calls sound like, I'm supposed to get the decision on my asylum application on Thursday. Is that going to happen? And then I had to explain that this case that has been going on for two and a half years will continue to go down the road to some unspecified date. It's a really tough conversation to have when that person and her minor children really don't know what the next chapter of their lives is going to look like.\\n\\nCORNISH: It's a lot of question marks, it sounds like, these conversations.\\n\\nMCKINNEY: Right.\\n\\nCORNISH: So you're talking about this massive backlog. What does that mean for these cases right now? I mean, do they go to the back of the line? What happens here?\\n\\nMCKINNEY: We're not exactly sure because we don't even know yet the exact number of hearings that have been canceled. We're waiting to hear about that. But, for example, in Charlotte, N.C., that court is 100 percent non-detained, and therefore, it is completely shut down. Hundreds of hearings have already been canceled, to be rescheduled once the government reopens. I imagine that most of them will be moved to 2020 because the 2019 docket is already full.\\n\\nCORNISH: How does this affect your clients' daily lives in terms of their ability to plan for work or does it benefit them in some cases?\\n\\nMCKINNEY: There is a resolution that is desired on both sides. The government, in many cases, has an interest in quick deportations. That's certainly what this administration has stated in the past. And my clients seek resolution of their case, and now that resolution is going to be prolonged by a year, in some cases, two years. In other courts, it could be even longer.\\n\\nCORNISH: What's it like for you personally to hear this discussion coming out of Washington, knowing that, essentially, the standoff is about immigration, is about border security?\\n\\nMCKINNEY: From what I hear, both political parties and virtually every major politician in Washington is in favor of border security. It's all about, what are we going to call it, right? I believe Senator Graham referred to the wall the other day as a metaphor. So we're really shutting down over 90 percent of pending immigration cases over a metaphor. It offends me personally. The situation was already dire, and now this shutdown is just making it all the worse.\\n\\nCORNISH: Jeremy McKinney is an immigration attorney in North Carolina. He's a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Thank you for speaking with us.\\n\\nMCKINNEY: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Why U.S. Visa Numbers Are Down\\n\\nU.S. visas issued are down despite President Trump's recent embrace of legal immigration. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy why that is.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nStopping illegal immigration is President Trump's signature issue. As for legal immigration, President Trump had this to say in his State of the Union address in February.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF 2019 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, according to recent data from the State Department, U.S. visas issued - that's temporary visas and immigrant visas - are significantly down. Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a free market think tank, has looked at the numbers and joins me now to talk about them. Welcome to the program.\\n\\nSTUART ANDERSON: Well, thank you for having me.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So walk us through the data. What did you find? And we should say we're talking fiscal year, 2017 to 2018.\\n\\nANDERSON: In 2018, temporary visas were down 7 percent, and immigrant visas for people coming for permanent residence - those were down 5 percent.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. And within those areas, we saw some really dramatic declines. I'm just going to tick through what you found - a decrease of 7 percent of visas issued to immediate relatives, a decrease of 29 percent for fiance visas. Those are pretty interesting numbers.\\n\\nANDERSON: Well, I think the interesting thing about the fiance visas and the immediate relatives - it means that it's actually becoming much harder for an American citizen to bring a spouse to the United States. And that, I think, is directly tied to a State Department change in their manual on what's called public charge grounds. And what that has meant is that Americans are being separated from someone who they really want to spend the rest of their life with.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And when you say public charge, this is the rule that someone could be a burden on the country and use federal programs for the poor - food stamps, et cetera. And they're being denied on those grounds because they might not have the financial wherewithal to join their spouse.\\n\\nANDERSON: Yes. And obviously, there's been a big change in how that's been interpreted because Congress has not changed the law. And, in fact, it hasn't changed in a very long time. And this is separate from what the Department of Homeland Security is trying to do in a proposed regulation that has not gone into effect yet that many believe would much more dramatically reduce legal immigration to the United States.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Student visas are also down by 8 percent. And one of the things that you found is that student visas issued for Indian students are down 31 percent over the last two years. What's going on?\\n\\nANDERSON: What has happened is that Indian students have decided that America may not be the best place to make their career. They've seen an increase in the number of denials for H-1B visas to work after graduation. And also, there is very long wait times for employment-based green cards for Indians.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: There's been a lot of focus on the illegal immigration portion of this, but the legal part of this has gotten less attention while it seems like the system is being fundamentally changed.\\n\\nANDERSON: I think it's easier to notice when Congress changes the law than these incremental changes inside government bureaucracies. And what we've seen is the travel ban, a measure on what's called extreme vetting of visas, a Buy American and Hire American executive order and the public charge change by the State Department. And when you combine all those together, what we've seen is decreases in legal immigration, and even in people trying to come here as tourists or as students.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So I'm going to ask you to respond to that clip from President Trump. He's saying, we're open for business; we want as many immigrants to come in legally as possible. But these numbers seem to show that that isn't necessarily the case.\\n\\nANDERSON: I think the president has tried to look more moderate in the face of his other rhetoric about things like the caravan and other border policies. But I think the best advice is to ignore what is being said and to watch what is being done.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, thank you so much.\\n\\nANDERSON: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "E.U. Remains At Odds With U.S. Over Exit Of Iran Nuclear Deal\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nThe United States is working to build support for a new confrontation with Iran. This is the day that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets other foreign ministers in Warsaw, Poland. Their agenda is pretty broad - promoting peace and security throughout the Middle East. But some Europeans do disagree with the U.S. approach, particularly the U.S. withdrawal from a nuclear deal with Iran. And some Europeans are limiting their participation in this conference. Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative to Iran, is traveling with Secretary Pompeo, and he's on the line from Warsaw. Mr. Hook, welcome back to the program.\\n\\nBRIAN HOOK: Hi, Steve, good to be with you.\\n\\nINSKEEP: What do you want from U.S. allies who are still in this nuclear deal and still, frankly, want to do business with Iran?\\n\\nHOOK: What we would like is for the Iran nuclear deal not to come at the expense of peace and stability in the Middle East. And it is the case that the deal by not making any mention of Iran's missile program has enabled Iran. It's facilitated Iran's missile testing, which is in clear defiance of the U.N. Security Council. And it's also facilitated their missile proliferation around the region. So this is an opportunity, as you said, here in Warsaw. We're going to be discussing a range of issues. But in the case of Iran, we agree to disagree with the Europeans on the Iran nuclear deal. But I think we share the same threat assessment when it comes to Iran's missile testing and missile proliferation.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is it a downside or a disadvantage that some key European leaders like the EU foreign policy chief, just to give one example, that they're not there?\\n\\nHOOK: Well, we have every EU member state here in Warsaw attending. We have the British foreign minister, the Italian foreign ministers and a number of ministers from Europe. We have almost 70 nations attending from every region of the world. So we're very happy with the level of participation.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You will be, I'm sure, meeting with diplomats from various nations that are talking about continuing to do business with Iran. What do you want them to know? What do you want them to do?\\n\\nHOOK: When you are an investor in Iran's economy, you can never be sure whether you are facilitating commerce or terrorism. This is a country that doesn't follow international banking standards for a reason. They don't want people to follow the money. And this regime since 2013 has spent $16 billion in Syria and in Iraq and in Yemen, and it destabilizes the Middle East. It's a revolutionary regime that spends its commercial revenues in very malign ways.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I want to check on the progress of one part of the U.S. approach here, Mr. Hook, because the United States has been working to reduce Iranian oil exports. That's where the money is - or the biggest money is - when it comes to the Iranian economy. How much do you believe you have been able to reduce Iran's exports over the last few months?\\n\\nHOOK: Well, we've taken off over a million barrels of oil from Iran's export list. And that has denied them billions and billions of dollars in revenue. And that's a good thing. This is a regime that had a great opportunity with the Iran nuclear deal to get onto a better footing with the United States. And it took the sanctions relief and spent it in a lot of places where the United States is on the other side. And nowhere is that more true than in Syria.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I want to figure out, though, where this policy is going. You may know that the Iranian leader, Ali Khamenei, has made a statement put on its website in the last few hours. One quote from this translated is with regard to America, no problem can be resolved and negotiations with it have nothing but economic and spiritual loss. That is a quote from Ali Khamenei. Now, we should be clear, he's always saying that. He's always saying it's a bad idea to negotiate with the United States. But in this case, is he right? The United States really doesn't want to deal with this regime because you disagree with them so strongly.\\n\\nHOOK: I think he has it incorrect. The United States doesn't have any permanent enemies. And you look at the trajectory of both Japan and Germany after World War II as an obvious proof of that. The United States stands and supports the Iranian people. I think they would like to have better relations with the United States. We would like that as well. But this regime stands in the way of that in terms of just having much better relations with the United States and behaving like a normal country.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Can you imagine, at this point, President Trump getting on the phone with Ayatollah Khamenei and say, listen; the terms have to be different, but we could make a deal here?\\n\\nHOOK: The president and his secretary of state have made clear that we are open to negotiations with the regime. It is very difficult to do that. Only a few days ago, the ayatollah, the supreme leader of Iran, issued death threats against the president, the secretary of state and his national security adviser.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Oh, you're referring - there's an item on Twitter here - death to the few people running that country, meaning the United States. That's from Khamenei's Twitter account.\\n\\nHOOK: Yes. And he specifically named President Trump, Ambassador Bolton and Secretary of State Pompeo. And this has been consistent with the kind of rhetoric from the regime. The ayatollah has said that he requires hostility with the United States. We don't look at it that way. We know the Iranian people would like to have much better relations with the United States. But this regime is doing a very bad job of representing its own people.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Brian Hook is the U.S. special representative for Iran. He's on the line from Warsaw, Poland, where diplomats are meeting to discuss the Middle East today. Mr. Hook, thanks very much.\\n\\nHOOK: Thanks for having me on.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "Bankruptcy judge approves Philadelphia Energy Solutions' sale to a developer that has no plans to re-start a refinery\\n\\nCatalina Jaramillo/WHYY Bio Recent Stories Catalina Jaramillo is a part-time reporter for StateImpact PA. She covers water issues in the Delaware Watershed. She was born and raised in Santiago, Chile, and has written for several publications in Chile, Mexico and the U.S. She's a graduate of Columbia School of Journalism and has been a Fulbright and Metcalf fellow.\\n\\nA U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has approved the sale of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions complex in South Philadelphia to a Chicago-based developer with no plans to re-start refinery operations.\\n\\nAlso approved as part of PES' Chapter 11 reorganization is a $29 million settlement with the company's unsecured creditors that includes a $5 million severance fund for former refinery workers.\\n\\nThe sale to Hilco Redevelopment Partners, which received tentative approval after a heated confirmation hearing Wednesday in Wilmington, likely means the end to 150 years of oil-refining activities in the city.\\n\\nPES filed for bankruptcy in July, one month after an explosion and fire destroyed parts of the 1,300-acre refinery complex. A week after the fire, the company shut down operations and laid off about 1,000 workers. The 335,000-barrel-per-day complex was the largest oil refinery on the East Coast, and the largest stationary source of air pollution in Philadelphia.\\n\\nHilco offered $252 million for the complex, according to PES lawyers, representing the highest bid and the best opportunity for creditors to recover their claims. But the offer was valid only if confirmed by the court before Feb. 13.\\n\\nI'm very much satisfied that the sale to Hilco is the highest bid and sale, Judge Kevin Gross said Wednesday evening. Clearly is in the best interest of the community as well, given the risks that were attended to the prior operations with the refinery, and a refinery frankly that had numerous and repeated problems over the years. And I see no reason to think that that wouldn't have continued.\\n\\nInitially objecting to the sale were PES' unsecured creditors, including the United Steelworkers union, which represented about 600 former refinery workers. They argued that the backup bidder, Industrial Realty Group in partnership with former Philadelphia Energy Solutions CEO Phil Rinaldi, offered $25 million more than Hilco and an opportunity to restart refining operations and bring union workers back. But PES said Hilco's bid still was deemed superior.\\n\\nThose differences were settled with the $29 million agreement, with $5 million going to former refinery workers.\\n\\nThis is not a joyful day, said Robert J. Stark, who represented the committee of unsecured creditors. We did the best we could with what we had.\\n\\nStark said that even though the settlement was far from a perfect outcome, it would benefit the most vulnerable creditors of this horrible case, employees who one day were going to work and then were out of work and figuring out if they would have to move to be able to pay their bills and mortgages.\\n\\nThis gives them cash now, when they need it, said Stark, who urged the judge to confirm the plan.\\n\\nThe sale and the settlement are a substantial part of PES' plan to emerge from bankruptcy. During the three-hour hearing Wednesday, the company's lawyers and other creditors urged Judge Gross to approve its fourth amended plan for reorganization, which resolved all but four of the 13 objections to the previous version of the plan filed last week.\\n\\nPES' lawyers told Gross the plan achieved the single most dramatic turnaround from a dramatic situation. It moved matters from uncertain and unpromising to a proposal they said maximizes the value to be distributed to creditors, secures operations at the refinery site, pursues the recovery of $1.2 billion in insurance claims, and contemplates the investment of millions in the site and the creation of thousands of new jobs through the sales of all its assets to Hilco.\\n\\nBut because negotiations continued until the very last minute — the hearing was postponed twice during the day — most of the stakeholders, as well as the judge, could not read the amended plan before the hearing.\\n\\nWe have a mess this afternoon, said David L. Buchbinder, the U.S. trustee who acts as a watchdog for the process. I appreciate the progress, but before we should sign a confirmation plan, we should see it.\\n\\nJudge Gross, who has set his retirement for March, agreed.\\n\\nHow can I confirm a plan that I haven't seen? he asked.\\n\\nPressed by the deadline set by Hilco, the judge overruled the remaining objections, approved the sale and the settlement, and set up a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m.\\n\\nI will be prepared to approve confirmation tomorrow assuming there are no new objections, he said. You know, I've been on the bench almost 14 years, this might be the most difficult confirmation I've had.\\n\\nRyan O'Callaghan, former president of United Steelworkers Local 10-1, said he was conflicted after the judge's ruling, even though the settlement meant a direct benefit to the union's members.\\n\\nThat $5 million is not equal to a job, is not equal to employment, is not equal to the brotherhood and the sisterhood that we had in the refinery, we were a family there, it doesn't equal that, O'Callaghan said. And it does nothing for the poor in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding communities because I don't know how the area is going to make up $16 billion in economic activity.\\n\\nEnvironmental leaders who have fought for a cleaner use of the site applauded the judge's decision.\\n\\nAfter over a century and a half of endangering the health of residents and the environment, this decision means a permanent end to the city's largest industrial source of harmful air pollutants and climate pollution, the Clean Air Council's director, Joseph Otis Minott, said in a statement. Hilco must work with all stakeholders to leverage this opportunity to transform the site so it protects our air, water, health, and safety while spurring economic development and high-paying union jobs.\\n\\nMark Allan Hughes, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, said ending the city's long oil-refining legacy is great news and the best possible outcome from the bankruptcy process.\\n\\nRather than being a poster child for what the world is turning away from, we can now be a poster child for where the world is going, Hughes said. The world is moving towards a lower carbon future, a lower carbon energy system, where the transition (is) from brown, polluting, fossil-fuel based energy systems, to green, non-polluting, clean, renewable energy systems.\\n\\nHughes, who chaired the committee on the environment for the city's Refinery Advisory Group, applauded Mayor Jim Kenney for standing by the recommendations made by the advisory group of favoring a safer and cleaner use for the site.\\n\\nWhen it really got hard last week, when objections were being raised, on several occasions the city stated and restated its position about reopening the refinery and was frankly not intimidated, Hughes said.\\n\\nCity officials supported Hilco's bid when it was first announced, arguing that it followed recommendations presented by the Refinery Advisory Group formed in the aftermath of the fire: a safer and more environmentally friendly mixed-use development of the site.\\n\\nEditor's Picks"}
{"original": "Why Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte Distrusts The U.S.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nWant to know why the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, seems to hate the U.S. so much? The roots go back more than a century, but there's a more recent reason as well. For that, look no farther than the Evergreen Hotel in the southern city of Davao, where Duterte served as mayor for more than 20 years.\\n\\nIt's a rundown flophouse, up a long flight of stairs in the middle of Chinatown. At $15 a night, it's way overpriced. A sign on the wall says Strictly No Smoking. The desk clerk warns that making bombs in the rooms is highly prohibited, too — even though she admits with a nervous laugh that it's been done before. By an American citizen named Michael Meiring.\\n\\nOn May 16, 2002, the self-described treasure hunter accidentally blew himself up in room 305 with an explosive device he had kept in a metal box in his room. Fe Basan, then commander of the Santa Anna Police Station around the corner from the Evergreen, arrived on the scene minutes after the explosion.\\n\\nThere was a fire, and heavy smoke in the room, Basan says. And we saw him in the room with his leg already gone, and unconscious, maybe because of the pain.\\n\\nBasan says Meiring had been a frequent guest at the hotel, but not a popular one. He was not a friendly guy, she recalls the bellboys telling her. One who got easily irked and didn't want to talk to anyone. A man who had given hotel staff strict instructions not to touch the boxes in his room — with reason, as it turned out.\\n\\nBasan says police rushed Meiring to the hospital, planning to interrogate him later. They started preparing criminal charges against him — for starters, for keeping explosives in his room and causing property damage to the hotel.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Sullivan for NPR Michael Sullivan for NPR\\n\\nBack then, the island of Mindanao was a dangerous place, a hotbed of separatist violence — beset by an ongoing communist insurgency and various Muslim separatist groups chafing at rule from Manila. Even today, it remains dangerous. At the time of the Meiring incident, there had been recent other bombings, not far from Davao, which made police eager to question the American.\\n\\nBut they never got the chance. Meiring was spirited out of the hospital just a day later, allegedly by U.S. operatives, says the former commander of military intelligence in Davao at the time, who wishes to remain anonymous.\\n\\nAccording to the doctor, he was taken by men, at least four, wearing FBI shirts, and then he was flown from Davao to Manila in a chartered plane, the former commander says.\\n\\nThe men persuaded the hospital administrator to allow them to take Meiring, the commander says, by offering the administrator a deal. Let Meiring go, and they would ensure the administrator's daughter — a nurse — would get a coveted U.S. visa.\\n\\nChief Inspector Basan says someone from the embassy promised her the same thing if she allowed U.S. agents access immediate access to Meiring at Davao Doctors Hospital, but she says she wasn't interested. When Duterte found out Meiring was gone, Basan says, he was furious.\\n\\nThe former army intelligence commander says the mayor saw Meiring's removal as a violation of Philippine sovereignty and of his own authority. That's the beginning of why Mayor Duterte, now President Duterte, hates the Americans, he says.\\n\\nThe mayor had reason to be angry, says Serafin Ledesma Jr., publisher of the Mindanao Journal.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Sullivan for NPR Michael Sullivan for NPR\\n\\nThe sheer arrogance of the FBI agents to just barge into Davao City and pull out [a] very important person who should have been undergoing interrogation by Davao City authorities, Ledesma says. It was very roughshod treatment [Duterte] got from the embassy. Because in those times, we were solving a lot of problems involving bombings here and there, and it turns out, here is an American with explosives which prematurely exploded. And why is he in that hotel? And why is he carry[ing] explosives?\\n\\nWhen NPR reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Manila to ask about the 2002 Meiring incident, we received an emailed response:\\n\\nMr. Meiring was initially treated in Davao City. Upon the recommendation of local doctors, Mr. Meiring was transported to a hospital in Manila. Once in Manila, doctors then recommended his medical transfer to the United States to a facility that had a more advanced burn center. ... We took no action beyond providing routine consular services to a U.S. citizen with a medical evacuation.\\n\\nPress reports in Manila and Mindanao have speculated that Meiring worked for the CIA at a time when the U.S. was bolstering its military presence in Mindanao as part of the post-Sept. 11 war on terrorism. Meiring's ability to travel around Mindanao, including rebel-held areas, only fueled speculation here that he was part of a larger, clandestine operation to destabilize Mindanao. It would be a pretext to justify Manila to allow a bigger U.S. presence in the region.\\n\\nI cannot say that's right, but I cannot also say that it's wrong, says the former army intelligence officer. Maybe because he was a 'treasure hunter' and had maps, maybe that's the cover story of his true intention here.\\n\\nLedesma, of the Mindanao Journal, is more blunt, saying, The fact that he was pulled out of the hospital by FBI agents tells you a story that he is not after all [the] treasure hunter, as he claims to be.\\n\\nDuterte has suggested much the same thing and cited the incident to explain his decision in 2013 not to allow the U.S. military to operate drone flights out of Davao.\\n\\nThe Meiring case is one reason for Duterte's mistrust of the U.S. — the main reason, according to most — but not the only one. His sense of grievance goes back even further into the past, to history dating back to the U.S. colonial rule of the Philippines from 1898 to 1946.\\n\\nHe's not against the American people. But more the policy, says Davao journalist Editha Caduaya, who has known Duterte for decades. He is angry, she says, about the injustice done to the Moros, the Muslims of Mindanao. Why? Because his mother has roots from the Muslim settlers of Mindanao.\\n\\nDuterte is particularly incensed, Caduaya says, about the alleged massacre of hundreds of Moro Muslims, including women and children, by U.S. troops on the island of Jolo in 1906. Duterte circulated pictures from that era to his fellow heads of state at last month's ASEAN summit in Laos.\\n\\nWhen he recalls that incident, Caduaya says, he usually rants.\\n\\nTaken together, the Meiring incident and the history of U.S. involvement in Mindanao help explain Duterte's mistrust of the U.S. and his profane language in reaction to what he sees as U.S. lecturing about alleged human rights violations in his ongoing war on drugs, in which at least 3,600 people have been killed.\\n\\nEven so, Duterte says he still values the U.S.-Philippine relationship. He just wants the U.S. to stay out of the Philippines' domestic affairs. Another round of joint U.S.-Philippine Marine exercises went ahead this month, though Duterte suggested they may be the last.\\n\\nAs for Meiring, the alleged treasure hunter — he died in the U.S. in 2012. There's still a warrant for his arrest in Davao."}
{"original": "A Spike In Liver Disease Deaths Among Young Adults Fueled By Alcohol\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption South_agency/Getty Images South_agency/Getty Images\\n\\nDr. Elliot Tapper has treated a lot of patients, but this one stood out.\\n\\nHis whole body was yellow, Tapper remembers. He could hardly move. It was difficult for him to breathe, and he wasn't eating anything.\\n\\nThe patient was suffering from chronic liver disease. After years of alcohol use, his liver had stopped filtering his blood. Bilirubin, a yellowish waste compound, was building up in his body and changing his skin color.\\n\\nDisturbing to Tapper, the man was only in his mid-30s – much younger than most liver disease patients.\\n\\nTapper, a liver specialist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, tried to get the patient to stop drinking.\\n\\nWe had long, tearful conversations, Tapper says, but he continued to struggle with alcohol addiction. Since then, the young man's condition has continued to deteriorate and Tapper is not optimistic about his chances of survival.\\n\\nIt's patient stories like this one that led Tapper to research liver disease in young people. According to a study published Wednesday in BMJ by Tapper and a colleague, fatal liver disease has risen, and young people have been hit the hardest.\\n\\nThe study examined the number of deaths resulting from cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. Data came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and covered the period from 1999 to 2016.\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that deaths from liver-related illnesses have increased dramatically, and mortality in young people rose the fastest. Although these illnesses can be caused by several things including obesity and hepatitis C infection, the rise among young Americans was caused by alcohol consumption. The number of 25- to 34-year-olds who died annually from alcohol-related liver disease nearly tripled between 1999 and 2016, from 259 in 1999 to 767 in 2016, an average annual increase of around 10 percent.\\n\\nWhat's happening with young people is dismaying to say the least, says Tapper.\\n\\nCertain ethnic groups, like whites and Native Americans, also saw large increases in liver-related deaths in all age groups, while Asian-Americans saw decreases.\\n\\nThe rise in alcohol-related deaths overlaps with rising rates of binge drinking from 2002 to 2012 observed across much of the U.S.\\n\\nThe authors noted a sharp spike in mortality starting in 2009. The reason for the spike is unclear, but Dr. Neehar Parikh, a liver specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School and Tapper's co-author, has a theory.\\n\\nIt correlates with the global financial crisis, Parikh says. We hypothesize that there may be a loss of opportunity, and the psychological burden that comes with that may have driven some of those patients to abusive drinking.\\n\\nThe increase among younger Americans is particularly troubling, because it kills people in the prime of their life.\\n\\nEach young patient that dies is a tragedy, says Parikh. It's years of life lost.\\n\\nThe study is the latest to confirm that liver-related illnesses are becoming increasingly prevalent. A report published Tuesday by the CDC shows that the age-adjusted death rate from liver cancer has increased 43 percent since 2000. And a recent study of veterans found that cirrhosis cases nearly doubled between 2001 and 2013.\\n\\nBut Dr. Vijay Shah, who heads the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Mayo Clinic and was not involved with this research, says that the study's emphasis on young Americans is new.\\n\\nAlcohol-related liver cirrhosis used to be considered a disease that would happen after 30 years of heavy alcohol consumption, Shah says. But this study is showing that these problems are actually occurring in individuals in their 20s and 30s.\\n\\nThere has been a shift in the kind of patient we're seeing, agrees Dr. Sumeet Asrani, a liver specialist practicing in Dallas who did not contribute to the study. It fits with what we see in practice. We're seeing younger and younger patients with alcoholic liver disease.\\n\\nDespite the recent increase, cirrhosis remains a relatively minor cause of death for young Americans, accounting for only 1.4 percent of total deaths in the 25-34 age range. But it's much more significant for young Native Americans, accounting for 6.3 percent of deaths.\\n\\nTapper thinks the problem is only going to get worse. Some conditions that cause liver trouble, like hepatitis C, have been falling. But other risk factors, including obesity, are on the rise. Alcohol consumption and obesity could interact to worsen liver disease, Tapper says.\\n\\nTapper says he thinks that policy could play a role in addressing the problem. For instance, strategic taxation of alcoholic beverages could deter consumption, just as raising the taxes on cigarettes has been shown to reduce smoking. He cites the example of Scotland, which recently set minimum prices for units of alcohol to deter binge drinking. He also points to public health interventions, such as counseling, that help people quit drinking.\\n\\nThe good news is that liver disease is often reversible. Many patients can recover if they stop drinking soon enough.\\n\\nI've had patients who came to me in a wheelchair, Tapper says. Three months later, they're shoveling snow and their lab tests are normal. It's always because they made that choice to stop drinking.\\n\\nPaul Chisholm is an intern with NPR's Science desk."}
{"original": "We Answer The Question: What Is Medicare For All?\\n\\nDemocratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who's a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, has endorsed Medicare for all. But the details of what that means are rather elusive.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nVarious Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind an idea long thought to be on the outer edge of progressive politics - so-called Medicare-for-all. Senator Kamala Harris endorsed the idea the other night in a CNN town hall. She also suggested getting rid of all private insurance.\\n\\nClearly health care is going to be a major issue in the Democratic primary and seems like a good moment to have NPR's health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak on to educate us. Good morning, Alison.\\n\\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\\n\\nMARTIN: We've heard this phrase for a long time, but it's worth explaining it again. Can you just describe what exactly is Medicare-for-all?\\n\\nKODJAK: Yeah, so what Senator Harris says she is supporting is a bill that was proposed by Bernie Sanders, and that would create a national single-payer health plan that would replace the whole private insurance system. And here's how she described it.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nKAMALA HARRIS: Well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.\\n\\nKODJAK: So everyone would get a Medicare card just like the one that my elderly mother has, and doctors would have to sign an agreement to participate in the program.\\n\\nMARTIN: And as you point out, this is the same thing as the single-payer system. So everyone may hear Medicare-for-all and think, oh, this is just for, you know, elderly people. But this is actually - what she's proposing is a much more substantive overhaul of the current health care system.\\n\\nKODJAK: Yeah, it's huge. It would change everybody's health insurance.\\n\\nMARTIN: How would it be paid for?\\n\\nKODJAK: Well, that's the big unknown.\\n\\nMARTIN: (Laughter).\\n\\nKODJAK: I mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. Harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and Sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. Right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and Sanders says his - making Medicare-for-all will cost less. But the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a Social Security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. And then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions.\\n\\nMARTIN: So we know Kamala Harris is behind this idea. What about the other candidates who've thrown their hat into the ring thus far?\\n\\nKODJAK: Yeah, well, we have Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren who both also co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill, so the - that Democratic crowd is pretty much all in. You have two so-called moderate billionaire businessmen who are testing the waters, those centrist candidates. Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks - he called this program not American because it would eliminate the health insurance industry. Mike Bloomberg - he says a Medicare-for-all plan would, quote, bankrupt us. So those two potential candidates aren't quite as supportive as the three senators who have already co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill.\\n\\nMARTIN: I mean, we should just point out it wasn't that long ago that there was an overhaul of the American health care system that gave birth to the Affordable Care Act. So - and these Democrats are arguing that didn't go far enough. But this is a very politically difficult issue. I mean, how does it poll with the public? Do Americans want a single-payer system?\\n\\nKODJAK: You know, conceptually they do. Fifty-six percent of people in a recent poll said they were supportive. But when you get into the nitty gritty - like, you're going to have to change your insurance, and if you like it, you won't get to keep it - people don't like that. People never like to hear that they're going to have to pay more taxes even if it replaces their insurance premiums. And of course the insurance industry is going to fight this like crazy...\\n\\nMARTIN: Right.\\n\\nKODJAK: ...If it gets to that point.\\n\\nMARTIN: NPR's Alison Kodjak - thanks, Alison.\\n\\nKODJAK: Thank you, Rachel.\\n\\nMARTIN: One correction now - earlier we described the Kamala Harris campaign as backtracking from one aspect of Medicare-for-all. Her campaign has said that in fact she remains supportive of the Medicare-for-all bill she co-sponsors with Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "United Airlines Settles With Passenger Dragged From Plane\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Julio Cortez/AP Julio Cortez/AP\\n\\nUpdated on 4/28 at 1:15 p.m. ET\\n\\nUnited Airlines and lawyers for the passenger seen on video being dragged from a United airliner in Chicago say the man has reached an amicable settlement with the airline. The terms of the agreement were not announced.\\n\\nA statement released by the Chicago law firm of Corboy and Demetrio said Dr. David Dao has reached an amicable settlement with United Airlines for the injuries he received in his April 9th ordeal, which was captured on video and viewed worldwide.\\n\\nUnited's statement refers to the unfortunate incident, and promises in the future it will put our customers at the center of everything we do.\\n\\nIn his statement, lawyer Thomas A. Demetrio praised United CEO Oscar Munoz: Mr. Munoz said he was going to do the right thing, and he has. In addition, United has taken full responsibility for what happened on Flight 3411, without attempting to blame others, including the City of Chicago. For this acceptance of corporate accountability, United is to be applauded.\\n\\nThe settlement came just hours after the airline announced a series of policy changes, promising to cut down on overbooking and raise the maximum incentive for passengers to skip a flight to $10,000.\\n\\nOn the flight that became a public relations nightmare for the company, compensation for being voluntarily bumped had topped out at $1,000.\\n\\nUnited will empower its personnel to make decisions and find solutions that make sense for both customers and employees, Munoz said in a letter to senators Wednesday that was sent in response to inquiries about the unusual removal.\\n\\nIn all, United announced 10 policy changes in response to sharp criticism it received over a debacle that unfolded on a United Express Flight on April 9, after passenger David Dao refused to give up his seat on a flight he'd already boarded, so the crew could make room for airline staff. He was eventually dragged out by security officers, suffering injuries in the process.\\n\\nFrom now on, United says, it won't require customers seated on the plane to give up their seat involuntarily unless safety or security is at risk. The airline also says it will limit its use of law enforcement officers.\\n\\nThe increased compensation puts United in line with rival airline Delta, which announced days after the forced removal in Chicago that it was increasing its maximum compensation for passengers giving up seats to nearly $10,000, up from $1,350.\\n\\nUnited's other changes include making sure airline crews are booked onto flights at least an hour before the scheduled departure time. United also says it will create an automated system to solicit volunteers to change their travel plans when flights are overcrowded, and give more training to its employees.\\n\\nThe incident on a flight from Chicago to Louisville triggered a firestorm of outrage against United, fueled by videos of the confrontation and what was seen as a tone-deaf response from the airline, whose initial explanations ignored the violence on one of its planes and stated simply that one customer had refused to leave. Soon after, United's CEO Munoz stated, I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers.\\n\\nOn Friday, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure said that Munoz would testify on May 2nd about airline customer service issues. Representatives from American Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines are also slated to speak.\\n\\nMunoz sent the Senate Commerce Committee a letter Wednesday in response to senators' questions, in which he said the airline crew had been designated must-ride on the oversold Chicago-Louisville flight because they were scheduled to operate a flight out of Louisville the next morning, and their original flight had been delayed.\\n\\nThe must-ride decision was made, Munoz said, so the crew could get the mandatory amount of rest required by the FAA and to avoid further delays for many other customers down line.\\n\\nReplying to the Senate panel's question about compelling a passenger to get off a plane, Munoz said, It is rare that a passenger is denied boarding after already having been seated."}
{"original": "David Petraeus On Soleimani\\n\\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:\\n\\nThe targeted killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani has sent shock waves through the Middle East, as well as the military and foreign policy establishment here in the U.S. In Iraq today, the parliament has voted for the expulsion of U.S. troops.\\n\\nRetired General David Petraeus was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and led the troop surge in Iraq in 2007. We spoke with him prior to today's expulsion vote when he told us he had an adversarial relationship with Soleimani.\\n\\nDAVID PETRAEUS: He sent me a message via the president of Iraq during the surge in Iraq at a time - about a year into it, March, late March of 2008 - when we were supporting the Iraqi forces that were attacking the Shia militia - the militia, in large part, that he supported - in the second-largest city in Iraq, Basra. The message he sent indicated that he controlled the policy for Iran and that we should deal with him. It said, General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Soleimani, control the policy for Iran when it comes to Iraq and also Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan. In other words, you should deal with me if you want to try to reach some kind of resolution of this issue, short of having to continue the battle in Basra, which was quite tenuous at that time. We did not deal with him. I essentially told him to pound sand.\\n\\nMCAMMON: You mentioned the Shia militia's general. But there are those who see your role as instrumental in the influence of the Shia militias inside Iraq's U.S.-backed security forces because they were absorbed into the police. How do you respond to that?\\n\\nPETRAEUS: Well, there's no question that, again, there was a presence of these different militias that was emerging during my time as a three-star. There is also no question that I insisted on the removal of key leaders - all of the brigadier generals and above in the police forces, for example. There was - these were actually paramilitary police forces, not just cops on the beat - two full divisions of them.\\n\\nWe would refuse to reconstitute these forces, to retrain them, to fill them back up with people, equipment and weapons and so forth until the toxic leaders were removed. Sadly, those leaders were returned to their positions several years later. And unfortunately, these toxic leaders were a large part of the undoing of Iraq that allowed the Islamic State to get back up on its feet and ultimately to come back into Iraq and to defeat the Iraqi security forces in the north and the west.\\n\\nMCAMMON: Well, as you're no doubt aware, there is video of Iraqi security forces letting militia members into the Green Zone to attack the U.S. Embassy last week. So clearly, they continue to have influence with the security forces. What does Soleimani's death actually change in terms of the situation on the ground?\\n\\nPETRAEUS: Well, I think it's impossible to overstate the significance of this action, really. And it was hugely disappointing to see a brigade of Iraqi forces essentially surrender their mission of defending the Green Zone as this huge number of militia swarmed into it and then surrounded our embassy and got inside part of it, doing a lot of damage. The real question here is, of course, how do Iranian forces directly and their proxies indirectly - throughout the region and beyond, including in cyberspace - respond to this attack? How does...\\n\\nMCAMMON: And what's your prediction?\\n\\nPETRAEUS: ...Iran now respond? Well, I think Iran is not in the strongest of positions, given the sanctions, a dismal economy and widespread Iranian popular unrest. So I tend to think it is more likely that we will see a variety of proxy attacks. And again, Iran has a lot of proxies throughout the region, thanks to the efforts of Qassem Soleimani. But really, this comes down to whether or not this has restored some degree of deterrence, which clearly was lacking, given what Iran and their proxies were doing throughout the region, and steadily ratcheting the efforts upward.\\n\\nMCAMMON: That's your hope that this reestablishes deterrence. But Iran is talking about targeting American personnel everywhere and anywhere. What are the chances this backfires?\\n\\nPETRAEUS: There are chances of that, without question. I mean, look. There's no question that the tensions have been dramatically increased as a result of this action. Perhaps the overlooked question is what kind of diplomatic initiative the U.S. puts forward now. This would very well, I think, be the time to - through intermediaries first and then directly with Iran - to sit down and say, OK, let's stop. Let's come to some agreement because this is clearly headed in a very bad direction. Make no mistake about it. There will be losses on all sides if this escalates further.\\n\\nMCAMMON: That's retired General David Petraeus. Thanks so much for talking with us.\\n\\nPETRAEUS: My pleasure, Sarah. Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump: Short-Term Deal To End Shutdown OK If It Has 'Prorated Down Payment' On Wall\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 9 p.m. ET\\n\\nAfter an at-times heated debate, the Senate on Thursday, as expected, failed to approve either of the competing measures that would have ended the standoff over border wall funding.\\n\\nIf nothing else, the votes seemed to spur a flurry of efforts to find a way to end the standoff. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced on the Senate floor after the measures failed that he spoke with President Trump about a three-week stopgap bill to reopen the government.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., met to discuss the proposal. But later Thursday evening, a spokesman for Schumer said, Sen. Schumer and Senate Democrats have made clear to Leader McConnell and Republicans that they will not support funding for the wall, prorated or otherwise.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the White House had already made it clear to Graham that a three-week bill would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall.\\n\\nIt depends\\n\\nSpeaking to journalists Thursday evening from the White House during an event about trade, Trump said he was open to a compromise with Democrats that reopens the government if it includes a prorated down payment on the border wall that has been the sticking point in the ongoing funding impasse. But no breakthrough appeared to be imminent, based on the president's comments.\\n\\nThe president said he is open to whatever results from the discussions between McConnell and Schumer, but Trump would not commit beyond a broad statement to assess what the Senate leaders announce.\\n\\nIt depends on what the agreement is, the president said. If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it.\\n\\nTrump also restated how important he thought a permanent barrier on the Mexico border is to prevent what he called the smuggling of drugs and humans through wide open spaces where no such barrier stands now. He acknowledged that much of the contraband smuggled into the United States arrives at major ports of entry, but he said, The big stuff comes through the areas where you have nobody watching.\\n\\nDueling proposals fail\\n\\nDespite Trump's apparent willingness to entertain a short-term deal that would reopen the government, Democrats in Congress have been resistant to supporting any funding that would go toward construction of a wall or other barrier on the border with Mexico.\\n\\nThe Senate votes followed by a renewed effort to find a deal came on Day 34 of the partial government shutdown, which has left some 800,000 federal employees without their second straight paycheck — which many would have received Friday.\\n\\nThe first vote, on a proposal by Trump to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall as well as changes in immigration law, received 50 votes in favor, with 47 senators voting against it. Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas voted against the GOP measure while Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor.\\n\\nThe second proposal, sponsored by Senate Democrats, would have provided for two weeks of operating money for the government but included no funds for a wall while discussions on border security continued. It received 52 votes in its favor, and 44 senators opposed it. Six GOP senators supported the Democratic bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Cory Gardner of Colorado.\\n\\nBoth measures needed 60 votes to advance.\\n\\nAs a group of freshman House Democrats visiting the Senate chamber looked on earlier Thursday, tempers rose during the Senate debate. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., lashed out at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who instigated a previous shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, during the Obama administration.\\n\\nWith his arms crossed, Bennet accused Cruz of crying crocodile tears over the current lack of funding for first responders, including the Coast Guard. When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded, Bennet said.\\n\\nIt was underwater! Bennet continued. People were killed! People's houses were destroyed! Their small businesses were ruined forever! And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down for politics.\\n\\nC-SPAN via YouTube\\n\\nThe negotiations\\n\\nEarlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., threw cold water on reports that Democrats were working on a deal to fund border security but not a wall. At a Thursday morning news conference, she said Democrats were not engaging in behind-the-scenes planning of an offer.\\n\\nShe said Democrats are working on the regular appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, which could contain additional money for border security.\\n\\nTop Democrats and their aides had told reporters about a proposal that would outline the mutual border security priorities for Trump and members of Congress but would include no new funding for any wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., declined to offer specifics about what is being worked out by Pelosi and the House Homeland Security Committee, but he said Democrats are prepared to make an offer that includes significant new spending on border measures.\\n\\nWe are prepared to spend a very substantial sum of money because we share the view that the border needs to be secure, Hoyer said. The letter is going to articulate what we believe is an effective investment to accomplish border security.\\n\\nTrump wants $5.7 billion for the wall, and the Democrats' proposal could exceed that amount.\\n\\nAppearing on NPR's Morning Edition, White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp did not immediately rule the idea out. Why don't we have the Democrats come over and propose that over to the president? she said. What we need is a conversation.\\n\\nBut it's not clear whether Trump would sign off on the offer.\\n\\nSeveral conservative leaders who met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss immigration policy and strategy told NPR that the president had resolve and believed the ball was in Pelosi's court.\\n\\nYou don't negotiate against yourself, and that was a clear message, said Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund.\\n\\nAs for a strategy following the failed Senate votes, these conservatives said the White House was looking to peel off or win the support of moderate Democratic House freshmen who were elected last November in traditionally Republican districts. But that has been a White House strategy for more than a week, with few signs of defections.\\n\\nThere was no sense coming out of Wednesday's White House meeting that the partial shutdown would end anytime soon. We're out of the mentality that this is a sprint, said Cuccinelli.\\n\\nFood pantries\\n\\nRoughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown. Many will miss their second paycheck this week. Food pantries have been set up in several cities for the workers.\\n\\nIn an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, I don't quite understand why federal workers are going to food banks, suggesting they apply for loans to make ends meet until they receive back pay. There is really not a good excuse for why the affected workers face what Ross termed a liquidity crisis.\\n\\nIn his remarks from the White House on Thursday, the president defended Ross though he said he hadn't heard Ross' actual remarks. But I do understand perhaps he should have said it differently, Trump said.\\n\\nThe president continued: Local people know who they are, where they go for groceries and everything else, and I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is they will work along. I know banks are working along, if you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in time like this. They know the people, they've been dealing with them for years, and they work along — the grocery store — and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant.\\n\\nHe's done a great job, I'll tell you that, the president also said about his commerce secretary.\\n\\nPressure to resolve the shutdown also came from an unexpected source: former White House chief of staff and former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. He and four other former DHS secretaries wrote a letter to Congress and the president urging them to end the shutdown.\\n\\nDHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand, the former secretaries wrote. This is unconscionable.\\n\\nNPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Democrats Decry 'Dangerous' Foreign Interference Argument Made By Trump Lawyers\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\\n\\nUpdated at 11:40 p.m. ET\\n\\nThe Senate on Wednesday night concluded the first of two days full of questions in the impeachment trial of President Trump. The proceeding offered clues about the thinking of senators, but the session consisted mostly of trial lawyers on both sides magnifying arguments they have already delivered.\\n\\nThere were, however, controversial moments in which Trump's counsel took positions Democrats decried as radical or even unlawful.\\n\\nTrump lawyer Patrick Philbin and Rep. Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats prosecuting Trump, sparred over a topic that reverberated after Wednesday's session ended.\\n\\nPhilbin defended accepting credible information from foreign sources about a political rival, arguing that mere information is not something that would violate the campaign finance laws.\\n\\nIf it's credible information, he said, it's relevant information for the voters to know about for people to be able to decide on who is the best candidate for an office.\\n\\nHis defense echoes comments Trump has previously made about accepting compromising information from foreign governments about political opponents.\\n\\nSchiff became animated in responding, saying the suggestion that seeking foreign interference in an American election is a president's policy should have another name.\\n\\nI'm sorry, that's what I call corruption. And they can dress it up in fine legalese, but corruption is still corruption, Schiff said.\\n\\nFederal campaign finance laws do prohibit foreign contributions, or taking a thing of value from a foreign source in U.S. elections.\\n\\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said Senate Democrats were in shock when Philbin defended what she called a type of foreign interference.\\n\\nThis is setting precedent that is unheard of in our country. And it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, she said.\\n\\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he was flabbergasted by Philbin's inappropriate remarks. The president's counsel tonight, in a sense gave a green light for that kind of behavior to continue, he said. I hope and pray that cooler heads will prevail but I think there was a dramatic step backwards in terms of protecting the integrity of our election.\\n\\n\\n\\nWarner, a lead Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Philbin's advocacy contradicts the work of the intelligence community.\\n\\nMr. Trump's own Director of the CIA, Director of NSA, Director of National Intelligence, Director of FBI, who've all said their top priority going into 2020 is to make sure foreign interference does not continue and is not allowed, Warner said.\\n\\nSchiff, sounding aghast, agreed.\\n\\nIt's now okay to criminally conspire with another country to get help in a presidential election? Schiff said.\\n\\nAnother striking exchange occurred when Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz said if a president orchestrates a quid pro quo, or an exchange of favors, and it is done for more reasons than being corrupt, then the action should not trigger an impeachment.\\n\\nIf a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said.\\n\\n\\n\\nDershowitz said if a president does not act out of purely a corrupt motive, but rather has a mixed motive, meaning a president is acting of the country's interest and in hopes of improving reelection prospects, then the behavior cannot warrant articles of impeachment.\\n\\nHow many presidents have made foreign policy decisions after checking with their political advisers and pollsters? he asked.\\n\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the position brought Dershowitz into the land of legal absurdity, he tweeted. That anything a public official does for re-election is OK. That cannot be true.\\n\\nThe formal proceedings on Capitol Hill, in which senators from both parties submitted written questions to House managers prosecuting the case as well as Trump's defense lawyers, commenced as news emerged from the White House that the National Security Council told John Bolton, its former chief, in a letter that the manuscript for his upcoming book appears to contain significant amounts of classified information that needs to be excised before the book can be published.\\n\\nThat is being contested by Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, who on Wednesday released an email he sent last week to the National Security Council in which he asserted that nothing in Bolton's book could reasonably be considered classified.\\n\\nCooper said the National Security Council never responded to the email.\\n\\nThat manuscript, which reportedly contains dozens of pages on Trump's dealing with Ukraine, has loomed over this week's Senate impeachment trial sessions. That is because the book purportedly says Trump told Bolton that military assistance to Ukraine would be released only after Ukraine opened investigations into Trump's Democratic rivals — the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment and the proceedings in the Senate.\\n\\nThe first question Wednesday came from Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, three Republican senators who have signaled they may support a vote to hear from witnesses. They asked the president's defense lawyers how the Senate should weigh impeachment if Trump had more than one motive for his conduct. The question — like all others — were submitted to U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, who read them aloud.\\n\\nAttorney Patrick Philbin responded that once you're in mixed-motive land, once it is established that there is a legitimate public interest that could justify looking into something, just asking a question about something, the managers' case fails.\\n\\nThe first question from the Democratic side was whether the Senate could render a verdict without hearing from key witnesses, such as Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\\n\\nLead House manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., responded, The short answer to that question is, there is no way to have a fair trial without witnesses.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters later on Wednesday that he was uncertain about the prospect of getting 51 senators to vote to call witnesses: All Democrats and those who caucus with them would need at least four Republican senators to join them in order to get witnesses.\\n\\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked whether it mattered legally if Trump sought a quid pro quo from Ukraine's leader. Trump's attorney Alan Dershowitz responded with a broad view of executive powers, arguing that if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\\n\\nBut later, Schiff said: All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt, and you don't need to be a mind reader to figure out which is which. For one thing, you can ask John Bolton.\\n\\nThere was a definite shift in activity in the chamber Wednesday. Senate pages ran question cards and notes back and forth — in addition to their usual duties of running water and mail to senators' desks. Senators were also much more engaged in the question-and-answer portion. Dozens had question cards on their desks, took notes or prepared questions. Many watched the speaker at the lectern.\\n\\nThe session, which was scheduled to last eight hours on Wednesday, will continue for a further eight on Thursday. This stage in the proceedings comes a day after the president's legal team rested in its defense of Trump. Democratic House managers made their case last week on why the president should be removed from office. Trump was impeached last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\\n\\nAmong those watching the session Wednesday was Joseph Bondy, the attorney for Lev Parnas, a former associate of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Bondy was in the Senate gallery as a guest of Schumer. Parnas, who has been indicted in New York for alleged campaign finance violations, wasn't in the gallery because he has to wear a GPS monitoring device as part of his pretrial release. Bondy declined to say where Parnas would watch the proceedings from.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\nThe two days of Senate questions set the stage for a Friday vote on whether to allow witnesses.\\n\\nI hope we can get witnesses and documents, Schumer told reporters during a break in the questioning. It's an uphill fight. Is it more likely than not? Probably no. But is it a decent good chance? Yes.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed concerns about GOP senators Tuesday. Although Senate Republicans including Romney of Utah, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Murkowski of Alaska and Collins of Maine have indicated they may be open to hearing from witnesses, their final decision is still unknown.\\n\\nAccording to Democrats, multiple potential witnesses have firsthand accounts of what they say is a quid pro quo scheme with Ukraine that forms the basis of the two impeachment charges that Trump is facing. But Republicans maintain that witnesses can inject uncertainty into the proceedings and prolong the trial.\\n\\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., told NPR's Claudia Grisales that he remains very, very skeptical that there is any witness that is going to shed any light that is going to cause me to change my view on what the final outcome of what this trial ought to be. Republicans overwhelmingly support Trump's acquittal.\\n\\nAmong the sought-after witnesses is Bolton, the former national security adviser who captured Washington's attention this week following the release of revelations in his forthcoming book. Those purported book details, first reported by The New York Times, placed pressure on senators to vote to allow witnesses into the trial.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nBut the NSC in a Jan. 23 letter to Cooper, Bolton's lawyer, said: Under federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.\\n\\nThe letter, signed by the NSC's record management official, Ellen Knight, said the council would work with Bolton to help identify what material in the manuscript could be used.\\n\\nTrump's defense team has argued that the manuscript would be inadmissible in the trial.\\n\\nLawyers for Trump have accused Democrats of trying to invalidate the result of the 2016 election. They say Trump has not committed any crime and therefore cannot be removed from office, even though many legal scholars say a law need not be broken to secure an impeachment conviction that would remove a president from office.\\n\\nAlthough two previous presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have also been impeached, no U.S. president has ever been removed from office.\\n\\nDemocrats impeached Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for what the prosecution team says was a campaign to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations into Trump's political rivals by holding up $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance in order to apply leverage on Ukrainian authorities. House Democrats say the White House's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment investigation is proof of a cover-up and amounts to obstruction."}

The agency said in an initial statement that it will describe how it is identifying and understanding its approach to PFAS when it releases an action plan that is currently under review by other federal agencies.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the EPA issued a second statement saying that, contrary to some news reports, it has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, a draft of which is being circulated to other agencies. It said it is committed to evaluating new drinking water standards under a process required by the Safe Drinking Water Act.\\n\\nAlthough EPA has reportedly rejected the idea of regulating the chemicals under the SDWA, it has decided to list them as hazardous under the Superfund law, which would force polluters to pay for cleaning them up, Politico reported.\\n\\nLawmakers at federal and state levels said the Politico report appears to show that the EPA has dismissed calls for tough national regulation, and that states will now have to step up their own efforts to curb the chemicals.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, high levels of PFAS contamination have been found, among other places, in public and private water systems in the towns of Horsham, Warminster and Warrington in Bucks and Montgomery Counties near two military bases where the chemicals were used in firefighting foam for decades. The chemicals were also used in consumer products like nonstick cookware and fire-retardant fabrics; they are no longer made in the U.S. but persist in the environment, and are widespread in humans, scientists say.\\n\\nPennsylvania's Democratic U.S. Senator, Bob Casey, said he was outraged that the Trump Administration appears to have abandoned the Safe Drinking Water Act, which he says should be used to set national health standards for the chemicals.\\n\\nThey need to set a standard so we can ensure that people are safe from what is in essence poison in the water, Casey told StateImpact. So this is inexcusable. We cannot allow this to happen in Pennsylvania or any other state.\\n\\nCasey said he has already worked to push the Department of Defense to address the issue.\\n\\nWe've had to push several federal agencies year after year after year to do something about this, he said. And we are just getting warmed up because if they want to be pushed harder and harder we're going to continue to do that.\\n\\nDelaware Sen. Tom Carper said he's disappointed but not surprised by the report. During confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill last week, Carper, who is the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, had asked Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler if the EPA could commit to establishing a maximum contaminant level for PFAS within the next two years, and Wheeler answered no.\\n\\nWe are anxious to see a sense of urgency, a sense of commitment to getting to work on this, Carper told StateImpact. It's not a question of whether it's harmful, the question is are they going to develop a clean drinking water standard.\\n\\nCarper says unless Wheeler acts on PFAS, along with a number of other issues including climate change, he will try to block his nomination as permanent EPA Administrator.\\n\\nNew Jersey has led the nation in moving to regulate PFAS, and the DEP says it will decide by this spring on regulations of PFOA and PFOS. A team of scientists that advises the DEP has recommended a limit of 14 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and 13 ppt for PFOS. The state did set a limit for PFNA. Currently, the EPA has a recommended limit of 70 ppt for the two chemicals combined.\\n\\nPennsylvania state Sen. Maria Collett, a newly elected Democrat who plans to introduce two bills to curb the chemicals, said she too was disappointed but not surprised to read the report that the Trump administration has backed away from regulating the chemicals.\\n\\nThe uncertainty and failure to act in Washington is exactly why our state legislators need to step up, Collett said in a statement. I will continue to support efforts at both the federal and state level to regulate these chemicals, and hope my fellow legislators will support me.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Bucks County Republican whose district includes the Horsham area, said the report's suggestion that the EPA is shirking its responsibility to protect drinking water is unacceptable.\\n\\nFitzpatrick, the co-founder of a new bipartisan Congressional task force on curbing PFAS contamination, said: If EPA refuses to do its job, Congress must intercede.\\n\\nAdvocates for strict national standards on PFAS chemicals in drinking water have long called for the EPA to set enforceable national standards. But in the absence of federal regulation, some states such as New Jersey have begun to impose their own levels which are much lower than those recommended, but not required, by the EPA.\\n\\nOne campaigner said the EPA's apparent decision puts even more pressure on states such as Pennsylvania to set their own rules.\\n\\nThere is no credible expectation that EPA is going to do anything at all now, and the only way to ensure clean drinking water is for the states to step up, said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a longtime advocate for low health limits on PFAS.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf's newly created Action Team on curbing PFAS has failed so far to propose regulation that would set specific limits for PFAS chemicals, Carluccio said. They really have a responsibility they are not living up to at this point, she said.\\n\\nLocal governments, too, can protect residents from contaminated water, she said. Horsham Township, for example, has installed granular activated carbon filters after finding high levels of PFAS contamination on its public wells, and has brought it down to very low levels.\\n\\nBut Environmental Working Group, a national advocate for more action to curb the chemicals, said there shouldn't be a patchwork of regulations that varies from state to state or even town to town.\\n\\nThe most efficient and equitable way to remove these chemicals from the nation's drinking water supply is to use the agency's authority to set legal limits, said EWG's senior scientist, David Andrews.

During Inauguration Week\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images Martin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 11:28 a.m. ET\\n\\nAirbnb says it is canceling reservations made in the Washington, D.C., metro area during inauguration week, citing various officials' requests that people not travel to the area during this time.\\n\\nThe service will also block new bookings in the area during that period. Airbnb says it will refund guests whose reservations were canceled and reimburse hosts for the money they would have earned from the canceled reservations.\\n\\n[D.C.] Mayor Bowser, [Maryland] Governor Hogan and [Virginia] Governor Northam have been clear that visitors should not travel to the D.C. Metro area for the Inauguration, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Additionally, we are aware of reports emerging yesterday afternoon regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration.\\n\\nAirbnb did not specify the precise dates the policy applies to, which also affects bookings on HotelTonight, which is owned by Airbnb.\\n\\nThe company said it has taken steps to ensure hate group members are not part of the Airbnb community — banning numerous individuals from using its platform if Airbnb has learned they are either associated with known hate groups or otherwise involved in the criminal activity at the Capitol Building.\\n\\nThe move is likely to simplify matters for Airbnb hosts in the area. Neighborhood message boards in D.C. lit up in recent days with reports of shouting matches between pro-Trump Airbnb guests and D.C. neighbors, and of hosts hearing guests talking afterward about taking part in the riot.\\n\\nSome neighbors urged D.C. Airbnb hosts to be careful who they rent to, while others cautioned hosts not to run afoul of nondiscrimination policies. Hosts noted that Airbnb typically penalizes those who cancel bookings.\\n\\nOn Monday, Airbnb said it was cross-referencing the Jan. 6 arrest logs of D.C. Metropolitan Police and reviewing reservations in the D.C. area.\\n\\nMembers of hate groups are never welcome on Airbnb, the company said, and reminded hosts that if they suspect violations of this policy, they can notify Airbnb's safety line. The company also linked to a neighbor support line where community members can bring issues to Airbnb's attention."}
{"original": "Republicans Scrap Rule For Small-Business Retirement Plans\\n\\nEnlarge this image Gary Waters/Getty Images/Ikon Images Gary Waters/Getty Images/Ikon Images\\n\\nSenate Republicans voted Wednesday night to rescind an Obama-era policy that allows states to offer retirement savings plans to millions of workers.\\n\\nRetiree and worker protection groups say the move will hurt employees at small businesses.\\n\\nMany small businesses say they can't afford to set up retirement savings plans, such as 401(k) plans, for their workers. That's a big reason why so many Americans aren't saving, says Cristina Martin Firvida, the AARP's director of government affairs.\\n\\nThere are 55 million Americans who have no way to save for their retirement at work, Firvida says.\\n\\nShe says when bigger companies automatically enroll workers in retirement plans, the vast majority of people stick with it and keep saving. They could opt out, but they don't.\\n\\nAnd Firvida says if similar plans were in place for workers at small businesses, they would be 15 times more likely to save for retirement if they could do that straight out of their paycheck.\\n\\nBecause of that, Oregon, California, Illinois and five other states have passed laws to help small businesses enroll workers in state-designed plans. That legislation was given a boost by the Obama administration policy that Congress just overturned.\\n\\nOregon's state treasurer, Tobias Read, says he's disappointed by the vote. He explains that the Obama administration created guidance for states, effectively saying, if you do the savings plans this way, you're within federal law.\\n\\nBy rescinding that, Congress has now created uncertainty, he says. That could discourage more states from passing these laws.\\n\\nOregon is facing that uncertainty, too. But Read says with 1 million workers with no workplace retirement plan, his state is going to push ahead.\\n\\nWe believe we are safely within the law and we want to take the chance to help working Oregonians, Read tells NPR.\\n\\nOne of the first small business owners to take part in the so-called Oregon Saves plan will be Saleem Noorani of Albany, Ore. He runs two wine and beer shops and he has 11 employees who will be automatically enrolled in the pilot phase of the savings plan this summer.\\n\\nThey are all very excited that they are even being able to participate in the program, Noorani says. He says setting up a 401(k) plan was just too expensive for his small business. But the Oregon plan is free for him.\\n\\nNoorani's workers will choose from a few investment options. These plans are similar to state-designed 529 college savings plans. The state creates the framework, but the investments are managed by a private company — in Oregon's case it's State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nI was so glad to see Oregon come up with this plan where it makes it so easy and so simple, Noorani says. But he says he's also very confused about why Republicans in Congress have now voted to make these plans harder for states to set up.\\n\\nI'm a Republican and I can't find any logical answer for it, Noorani says. When you see something that's such a great solution out there, why do you go around and sabotage it?\\n\\nThe financial industry has been lobbying Congress to get rid of the Obama policy.\\n\\nLisa Bleier is a managing director and associate general counsel with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA. She says, Every state is coming up with all different ideas as to how they're going to do it. Bleier says that will create problems. SIFMA has other objections, too. And some in the industry think the government just shouldn't get involved.\\n\\nDennis Kelleher is president and CEO of the financial watchdog group Better Markets. He says there's another reason for the industry's opposition: If states set up plans that are relatively low-cost for workers, that might push the whole market in that direction and hurt financial firms' profits.\\n\\nIt's all about protecting profits and that's all this fight was really about, Kelleher says."}
{"original": "Sanders Would Spend $2 Trillion On Coronavirus Crisis\\n\\nBernie Sanders gave remarks early on Tuesday evening, but it wasn't the typical speech you'd expect a candidate to give on election night.\\n\\nVia webstream ahead of the polls closing, the Vermont senator addressed supporters about the growing coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nI don't have to tell anyone viewing this program that our country and, in fact, the world are facing an unprecedented series of crises, he said. We're dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We're dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country.\\n\\nSanders then went through a series of proposals that he says he will introduce to Democratic leadership to address both the health and economic concerns brought on by this pandemic.\\n\\nCalling it an unprecedented moment which will require an unprecedented amount of money, Sanders estimated spending at least $2 trillion to prevent deaths and job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe.\\n\\nFirst addressing the health care concerns, Sanders stressed that everyone in the country who needs to go to a doctor should be able to, regardless of income.\\n\\nIn the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency, he said.\\n\\nSanders emphasized that this proposal is not Medicare-for-All, a staple policy proposal in nearly every campaign speech of his on the trail, saying it's not possible to undertake passing such an effort at this moment.\\n\\nBut what this does say is that if you're uninsured, if you are underinsured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out-of-pocket expenses, Medicare will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their health care needs … will get all the health care that they need, he said.\\n\\nSanders went on to say that another top priority should be equipping hospitals and intensive care units with the equipment needed to deal with potential surges of patients coming into hospitals.\\n\\nNow, in my view, I mean, frankly, it is incomprehensible why in the wealthiest country on Earth, we are not better prepared, he said. But be that as it may, in my view right now, the federal government must work aggressively with the private sector to make certain that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community.\\n\\nSanders talked about mobilizing medical residents, medical school students and retired medical professionals to assist in dealing with the crisis, given the possibility that doctors and nurses themselves become ill.\\n\\nSanders argued that it's necessary to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to scale up production in the country of critical health care supplies, such as medical masks and ventilators.\\n\\nSanders also proposed expanding community health centers to increase access to care and utilizing the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to deal with the crisis.\\n\\nAs for the economic crisis, Sanders said the top priority is making sure that those who are unemployed because of the virus still retain a paycheck.\\n\\nThink about the millions of workers who are being laid off in the tourism industry, in the fast-food industry, the restaurant industry, the transportation industry, he said. These are folks that don't have a lot of money, as all of you know. Some 40% of the people in this country cannot afford a $400 emergency. So people are sitting out there and they're saying, 'My God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my family?'\\n\\nSanders wants the federal government to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium-sized businesses to keep workers employed until the crisis passes.\\n\\nSanders said the government should provide $2,000 cash to every household each month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families.\\n\\nHe also proposed that everyone who loses a job qualify for unemployment compensation at 100% of their prior salary with a cap of $75,000 a year.\\n\\nOther proposals included expanding the Meals on Wheels program, school lunches and food stamps; putting an immediate moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shut-offs; and waiving student loan payments.\\n\\nSanders admitted it won't be likely that Congress approves all his proposals. When you deal with the United States Congress, you don't get everything that you want, he conceded. There will be a picking and choosing here and there.\\n\\nSanders concluded by asking supporters to communicate with his campaign about their individual experiences during the crisis and to share any proposals they'd like to see enacted."}

Biden, 77, said Buttigieg, 38, reminded him of his late son, Beau.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced she is suspending her presidential campaign and would endorse Biden.\\n\\nStanding on stage with Biden in Dallas, Klobuchar said a unified party is crucial if Democrats want to beat President Trump.\\n\\nI believe that we are never going to out divide the divider-in-chief, she said.\\n\\nBiden, she said, will help Democrats win big.\\n\\nHe will not just govern with his head ... she said. He will also govern with his heart.\\n\\nHer decision came just one day before her home state is set to vote on Super Tuesday. In total, 14 states and one territory will head to the polls Tuesday, on a day when more than a third of all delegates in the Democratic primary will be up for grabs.\\n\\nTheir endorsements could play a key role for Biden, as the former vice president is trying to coalesce the more moderate wing of the party behind him in an effort head off Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads the current delegate count.\\n\\nSanders has held sizable polling leads in the two largest states voting on Tuesday — California and Texas — but if Biden is able to pull in significant portions of both Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's coalitions, his prospects could brighten considerably.\\n\\nBut the Sanders campaign disputes the notion that one candidate's support simply transfers to another like-minded candidate.\\n\\nI think people are far more complicated in their ideology than pundits like to suggest, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told NPR.\\n\\nIndeed, before the endorsement, polling seemed to indicate that Buttigieg's supporters could split to a number of candidates, including a sizable amount to Sanders. A Morning Consult poll found that Sanders was the second choice for 21% of Buttigieg supporters, followed by Biden and Warren with 19%.\\n\\nWhile Biden, who's second in delegates, has lagged behind Sanders financially, and in national polls in recent weeks, he has led the field in endorsements throughout the campaign.\\n\\nAhead of the South Carolina primary, he got a key endorsement from Rep. Jim Clyburn. Exit polls indicated that was a major factor in his decisive win.\\n\\nKlobuchar and Buttigieg sparred often during Democratic debates, as both candidates strove to present themselves as the best pragmatist option not named Joe Biden.\\n\\nIn the end, it was Biden who outlasted them both.\\n\\nBiden received another endorsement Monday, from former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who said he believes Biden is the candidate best able to defeat President Trump.\\n\\nA Midwestern moderate drops out\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\nKlobuchar saw a surge of momentum and fundraising after a strong debate performance and a third-place showing in the New Hampshire primary, but like Buttigieg, she struggled to expand or sustain that support as the primary moved into larger, more diverse states.\\n\\nShe finished sixth, with just 3% of the vote, in South Carolina on Saturday.\\n\\nThe senator from Minnesota had campaigned heavily in next-door Iowa. She had held nearly 200 events in the state and traveled to all 99 of its counties. She ended up finishing fifth there.\\n\\nIn Iowa and elsewhere during the campaign, Klobuchar often stressed her Midwestern roots and more moderate Democratic policies. She said she was a candidate who was able to get things done — and win in battleground areas.\\n\\nAnd she made jokes.\\n\\nShe often talked about getting big money out of politics by telling the story of her first Senate race and how she had so little money that she would call people she'd dated to fundraise.\\n\\nI raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends, she said at a debate last year. And I'd like to point out — it is not an expanding base.\\n\\nShe also touted several newspaper endorsements, including a co-endorsement (with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren) by The New York Times, an endorsement by the Quad-City Times in Iowa and endorsements by a few New Hampshire outlets, including the Union Leader in Manchester.\\n\\nBut early in her campaign, she also faced questions that took the spotlight off her policy positions and put it onto how she treated her staff. Anecdotes swirled about hair-comb salad forks and flying binders.\\n\\nI cried. I cried, like, all the time, said one former staffer, according to BuzzFeed.\\n\\nIn an interview with NPR last March, Klobuchar argued that voters should not be worried by the accusations. She acknowledged that she does push people hard, but her campaign denied the specific allegations and argued that she is just a tough boss with high standards.\\n\\nKlobuchar was one of four senators still running for president while also serving as jurors in the impeachment trial of Trump. The trial's schedule disrupted the final weeks of campaigning around the Hawkeye State.\\n\\nWith additional reporting by NPR's Benjamin Swasey"}
{"original": "Zuckerberg Looks To Clear Up Stance On Facebook, Fake News And The Holocaust\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is clarifying remarks he made about whether his platform should remove content posted by Holocaust deniers, saying he wasn't defending them when he commented that it was hard to know their intentions. His initial comments set off intense criticism earlier this week.\\n\\nI personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that, Zuckerberg wrote to Kara Swisher of Recode on Wednesday, the day after the site published a lengthy interview with the billionaire.\\n\\nIn the original interview, Swisher asked Zuckerberg about Facebook's policy of taking down fake news — something it has combated using a variety of approaches after fake news sources were found to have been used to manipulate voters in the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nSwisher used the Sandy Hook school massacre as an example, asking Zuckerberg why Facebook would allow an organization to post a conspiracy theory that claims the killings were staged.\\n\\nZuckerberg implied that Facebook would be quicker to take down harassment directed at a Sandy Hook victim than to remove a fake news story promoting the conspiracy theory. Then he offered up the example of the Holocaust.\\n\\nI'm Jewish, and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened, he said.\\n\\nI find that deeply offensive, Zuckerberg continued. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong, but I think ...\\n\\nSwisher interrupted to say, In the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.\\n\\nSeeming to view the question as primarily one of free speech, the Facebook founder said, I just don't think that it is the right thing to say, 'We're going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.' \\n\\nHe mentioned the potential that some people who are speaking in a public forum can simply get things wrong. But his critics said that denying the Holocaust was much more dangerous and problematic — and that Zuckerberg's suggestion that some of those denials weren't made to mislead people were astounding.\\n\\nThis is bonkers! wrote Cale Weissman of Fast Company, after using profanity (holy s***).\\n\\nThis position is so bizarre, it's hard to know where to begin, writes Yair Rosenberg in The Atlantic.\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League said Facebook has an obligation not to publish falsehoods about the Holocaust.\\n\\nIn the Recode interview, Zuckerberg said that rather than taking down a fake news or conspiracy post or barring the user, the company would seek to minimize it.\\n\\nOur goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue — but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services, Zuckerberg said. If something is spreading and is rated false by fact checkers, it would lose the vast majority of its distribution in news feed.\\n\\nFacebook would take a harder line, Zuckerberg said, if anyone published calls to violence or tried to organize any type of attacks.\\n\\nIn his clarifying email to Swisher, he concluded, I believe that often the best way to fight offensive bad speech is with good speech.\\n\\nThe heated discussion over Zuckerberg's remarks is the latest in a string of debates over whether Facebook is simply a technological platform, or if it should best be seen — and see itself — as a media outlet. That question has grown more complicated as the tech giant spends more to attract and create programming.\\n\\nIn January, Facebook said it was changing how its influential news feed works, giving prominence to news articles from high quality sources and pushing down others, as NPR's Aarti Shahani reported.\\n\\nIn recent months, Facebook has reached deals with journalists such as CNN's Anderson Cooper and Fox News' Shepard Smith, who are creating shows specifically for the platform. Other news organizations are also involved in the deal, which is meant to draw viewers to Facebook's Watch video section.\\n\\nOver the past week, Facebook's policies have also been called into question for how it handles news organizations, including their use of ads to boost their most high-profile projects.\\n\\nPeople at at least two news outlets — KPBS in California and The Texas Tribune — have complained that Facebook nixed ads because they were deemed to be political. In the Tribune case, an ad asked young people what issues they care the most about, ahead of the November election. At KPBS, an attempt to promote an investigative story about migrant children appearing in court without their parents was barred.\\n\\nReplying to complaints about the KPBS decision, Facebook product director Rob Leathern said the issue applies only to running ads on the platform, and is fixable by completing the authorization process.\\n\\nIf you are running ads in the U.S. about electoral or political issues, you will need to go through the authorizations process, he added. This includes news organizations — who are designated separately in the ad archive where these ads are retained publicly.\\n\\nThe same standards apply to all advertisers, Leathern said in another tweet. That and other tweets were in response to a posting by Jean Guerrero, who wrote the KPBS investigative piece. The story, she said, was effectively being censored by Facebook.\\n\\nIn a separate thread centering on the Texas Tribune's attempt to place an ad, the magazine's chief audience officer, Amanda Zamora, questioned why the ad was scrutinized so closely when materially false and harmful information passes through Facebook's news feed.\\n\\nToo bad efforts to engage readers in our journalism needs to be verified, when so much garbage fills my feed, Zamora wrote.\\n\\nDays after Facebook announced its push to promote reliable news back in January, the company acknowledged the possibility that social media can have negative ramifications for democracy.\\n\\nSamidh Chakrabarti, Facebook's civic engagement product manager, said the service was being used in unforeseen ways with social repercussions that were never anticipated."}
{"original": "Democratic Rep. Smith Is New Chair Of House Armed Services Panel\\n\\nSteve Inskeep talks to Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, about where U.S. troops are deployed — including at the southern border.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nThis week, newly empowered Democrats are asking why President Trump sent U.S. troops to the border with Mexico. The question comes from the House Armed Services Committee. New Chairman Adam Smith says he will use his power to question the president's use of the military.\\n\\nADAM SMITH: If you ask the military anything, do you know what the answer is? Yes. Can you take that hill? Can you win this war? They always say yes. That's why we have civilian control of the military. They need to have that attitude. We need to make the smart decisions to say, I appreciate the positive approach; I don't think you can, and I don't think it's in the best interests of the United States to spend your blood trying.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Adam Smith has represented Washington state for more than 20 years. We met in his Capitol office, where he's preparing for a hearing on Tuesday. He has questions about the president's chaotic decision-making. He says that even though he broadly agrees with some of the president's goals. For example, he favors the president's move to reduce the U.S. presence in Syria, just not doing it so suddenly in a tweet.\\n\\nSMITH: And that is the troubling thing, of course. The president - we won; it's over; ISIS is done; we can leave now. You know, I mean, where do you get that from?\\n\\nINSKEEP: Well, has the president been right to push for a smaller U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan?\\n\\nSMITH: I believe so. Yes. And Afghanistan's a real big problem. I really wish that the United States did not have national security interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our interest in the region is the threat of transnational terrorist groups, obviously. That's where bin Laden was hanging out when he hit us on 9/11. We want to make sure they don't rise again. But the perpetual notion that if we just put in another 5,000 troops, if we just stay another five years, then we'll have a stable enough government in Kabul that we'll have an ally - yeah. We are losing lives and spending money in Afghanistan, and I'm not sure we're making progress.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Just go. You're open to that, you said.\\n\\nSMITH: Well, not just go - there's no way to just go.\\n\\nINSKEEP: But...\\n\\nSMITH: OK.\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...Get going in whatever fashion...\\n\\nSMITH: Yes. Do it...\\n\\nINSKEEP: ...You can.\\n\\nSMITH: Yeah. It takes time - probably years, not months - in order to pull people out in a responsible way. But a strategy that says our continued military presence in Afghanistan is unlikely to improve the situation, is unlikely to be worth the cost, is an argument that is becoming more and more persuasive to me.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Do you intend to use the power that you have as the head of this committee to push for that outcome?\\n\\nSMITH: I intend to use the power that I have on this committee to spur that debate. And the only way out of this is through a negotiated settlement. And there will not be peace in Afghanistan, probably in my lifetime. There are so many factions and so many warlords. What you want is you want to try to reduce them. And the way to do that - make peace with the Taliban. You know, build some sort of coalition government. Believe me; there are costs to that. I understand that. You know, and then, hopefully, yes; use that group to fight off, you know, ISIS and others. But the Taliban blows hot and cold on that, you know, depending on the day, and I don't know.\\n\\nINSKEEP: When President Trump ordered troops to the border to help secure the border against a caravan that - been in the news shortly before the midterm election, was that a legitimate use of U.S. military power?\\n\\nSMITH: Absolutely not. And the active-duty troops, I think they, like, put up some barbed wire and maybe built a temporary structure or two, and you can't tell me that was a good use of their time. Border security has gotten a ton better in the last 14 years, in part because we've made a lot of policy decisions to do it. But the president is manufacturing a crisis to pander to his base and try to keep a - well, and obviously, he's not trying to keep his campaign promise because his campaign promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it. But he made that promise because it played well with the crowd. Something that plays well to the crowd doesn't translate into policy. Now, to the extent we have a - these caravans that are coming - they're turning themselves in. OK? You don't need a wall. You know, you don't need anything (ph) to stop them. We need stuff to process them. The only thing that has really changed is we could use some more money for judges to process asylum-seekers. You know, processing asylum-seekers is the crisis, and the president is demagoguing this issue instead of addressing the problems that he raises.\\n\\nINSKEEP: If the deployment to the border right before the election was not a legitimate use of military power, what was it? Was that a political use of the military?\\n\\nSMITH: Absolutely. I mean, the president was trying - this crisis - they're coming for us. You heard his language. You know, we have an invasion, you know, coming at us, which was utter and complete nonsense. But when you engage the active-duty military, that drives up the debate because that's what we use - and the military is stopping an invasion. Well, the military didn't stop anything. Most of those people who went down to the border were sitting around playing cards because they didn't have anything to do because there was no invasion.\\n\\nINSKEEP: What, if anything, are you prepared to do now that you are in the majority, should you see another deployment of the military that you view as political?\\n\\nSMITH: Well, the deployment's still going on, so this is not a past-tense problem. This is a present-tense problem, and our first hearing is going to be on this subject. We want an explanation of the policy. We want to shine a light on it and make it clear, in my view, that there is no legitimate purpose here. And if there's no legitimate purpose, then why are you wasting the amount of money that you're wasting to put them down there?\\n\\nINSKEEP: Are you concerned about further political deployments?\\n\\nSMITH: Absolutely. This president does not operate like any president I've ever dealt with or ever read about. He is unabashed in pursuing his agenda in any way he sees fit.\\n\\nINSKEEP: That leads to another question. We've been following the news from Venezuela, where there are two competing presidents. And one key factor, as we have reported, is - who is in charge of the military? - whose orders the military will follow. The United States is nowhere near that level of chaos, but it's a tense political moment. Have you asked questions of military leaders to be sure they know what rules to follow in the event of a crisis?\\n\\nSMITH: I think this is part of the debate and part of what went into the border deployment - was the concern that the president - there was mixed messages coming out of the White House that wanted to use them for law enforcement in the U.S., which is a clear violation of our Constitution and a precedent that we do not want to set. So yes; part of this discussion about the border deployment is going to be to emphasize the clear constitutional law that U.S. military does not do domestic criminal situations. They are not allowed to act as a law enforcement agency.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Have you already raised that question with military officials that you must talk with from time to time?\\n\\nSMITH: Yeah. I - well, I raised it with Secretary Mattis, but he's not there anymore, so - and we talked about this a couple times, as we were concerned about it. And I will say that the Pentagon secretary, Mattis, and everybody I spoke to was - you know, they were very adamant about not stepping across that line. The mixed messages were coming out of civilians in the White House, not out of the Pentagon. They were very clear that they were not going to engage in law enforcement activity.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Mr. Chairman, thanks very much.\\n\\nSMITH: Thanks for the chance.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MAMMAL HANDS' TRANSFIXED)\\n\\nINSKEEP: Adam Smith is the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which plans a hearing on the border deployment tomorrow.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MAMMAL HANDS' TRANSFIXED)\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAs Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tries to heal a deep rift among Arab partners, President Trump seems to be upping the ante. Trump says he consulted with Saudi Arabia and others on a recent trip to Riyadh and decided to call out Qatar for its very high level of terror financing.\\n\\nSince then, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department shortly before Trump spoke that this blockade is hindering the U.S.-led military campaign against ISIS, creating hardships for the people of Qatar and impairing U.S. and other international business activities in the region.\\n\\nTrump had asked Tillerson to help mediate the crisis, and the secretary has been calling his counterparts in the region to de-escalate the situation and resolve their grievances. Tillerson's carefully crafted statement urges the emir of Qatar to do more to stem terrorist financing but adds that others must also continue to eliminate factions of support for violent organizations within their own borders. He also pointedly asked Saudi Arabia and others to ease their blockade on Qatar.\\n\\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nTillerson then went to the White House, where Trump seemed to contradict him, putting the focus squarely back on Qatar. At a joint news conference with his Romanian counterpart, Trump described his recent visit to Riyadh, where nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior. So we had a decision to make. Do we take the easy road or do we finally take hard but necessary action? he said, adding he decided the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding.\\n\\nQatar is the regional headquarters for U.S. Central Command and home to some 10,000 American troops, NPR's Scott Horsley has reported.\\n\\nWhile current operations from Al Udeid Air Base have not been hindered or curtailed, the evolving situation is hindering our ability to plan for longer-term military operations, said Capt.

{"original": "Warren Declines To Endorse, Talks About Support From 'All Those Little Girls'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steven Senne/AP Steven Senne/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 1:15 p.m. ET\\n\\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ended her bid for the presidency on Thursday, acknowledging her place as the last major female candidate in the race and all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years.\\n\\nThe decision comes after disappointing finishes in all nominating contests so far, including Super Tuesday. She hasn't won or come in second in any states — and even finished third in her home state of Massachusetts.\\n\\nFor every American who desperately wants to see our nation healed and some decency and honor restored to our government, this fight goes on. And sure, the fight may take a new form, but I will be in that fight, and I want you in this fight with me. We will persist, Warren told campaign staffers after announcing her decision.\\n\\nWarren's exit leaves just former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard actively seeking the Democratic nomination. Biden leads Sanders in the delegate count, with Gabbard holding just one delegate after the Super Tuesday contests.\\n\\nWarren was asked by reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., about which former rival she might endorse and declined to announce anything immediately. Let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that. We don't have to decide this minute, Warren said.\\n\\nIn what had been a diverse field of candidates, Warren briefly led the pack nationally along with Biden in October and November, according to RealClearPolitics.\\n\\nDespite frequently turning in strong debate performances, Warren struggled to win over voters. During a debate last month, she effectively attacked former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg over his company's use of nondisclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases.\\n\\nAs a candidate, Warren eschewed some of the traditional trappings of presidential politics. She didn't hire a pollster and financed her campaign mostly through small-dollar contributions from supporters instead of targeting large donors. But as her candidacy started to look endangered, she didn't protest when a super PAC funded by big donors spent nearly $15 million on her behalf ahead of Super Tuesday.\\n\\nWarren didn't shy from making her gender a part of her campaign, for example, by touting her nevertheless she persisted slogan and taking the stage to the Dolly Parton's anthem to working women, 9 to 5. But she made gender just one component of her broader economic populist message, pushing child care policies alongside her raft of proposals.\\n\\nWarren was asked after dropping out about the role gender played in the campaign. That is the trap question for every woman. If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner!' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?'  she replied. I promise you this: I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on.\\n\\nBeing the woman with a plan quickly became Warren's identity on the campaign trail. It also became a liability when she started weathering attacks, first for not having a way to pay for Sanders' Medicare for All proposal, which she supports, and then over her eventual proposal to pay for that plan. (Sanders, for his part, has not yet released a detailed plan for how he would pay for Medicare for All if he's elected.)\\n\\nWhile she was considered Sanders' top competitor among progressive voters, embracing single-payer health care and wide-scale student-debt forgiveness, in the runup to Iowa, Warren attempted to pitch herself as a unity candidate. She started explicitly thanking her fellow candidates, including those who had dropped out, for their contributions to the race.\\n\\nA former Harvard Law professor whose research on personal bankruptcy led her shaped her progressive outlook, Warren entered politics via her interest in policy. She was a key architect of portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill, especially around the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But she could not secure Senate confirmation to lead the agency and wound up successfully challenging GOP Sen. Scott Brown in 2012.\\n\\nWarren was the first major Democratic candidate to step into the 2020 race, announcing an exploratory committee on Dec. 30, 2018, before formally announcing her candidacy on Feb. 9, 2019.\\n\\nNPR's Elena Moore contributed to this report."}
{"original": "How Large Employer Health Plans Could Be Affected By Obamacare Overhaul\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hero Images/Getty Images Hero Images/Getty Images\\n\\nIf you think that you wouldn't be touched by a Republican overhaul of Obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again.\\n\\nSeveral of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010).\\n\\nIt's not yet clear how President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the Senate to fully repeal the current statute. So they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. But they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.\\n\\nNonetheless, as tensions grow in Washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans.\\n\\nNo copays for preventive services\\n\\nThe health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. But Obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. Under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. The services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\\n\\nThe change that affects the most people on an ongoing basis is likely the requirement that plans cover without cost sharing all methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (There are limited exceptions for religious employers.)\\n\\nIn terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest, said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health.\\n\\nNo annual or lifetime limits on coverage\\n\\nEven the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. The health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.\\n\\nAnnual cap on out-of-pocket payments for covered services\\n\\nThe health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. In 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families.\\n\\nMany employers often had an out-of-pocket limit anyway, but this guarantees protection for people with high needs, said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who has written on this issue.\\n\\nAdult kids' coverage expanded\\n\\nThe law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. Republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law.\\n\\nGuaranteed external appeal rights\\n\\nConsumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel.\\n\\nThe provision applies to all new health plans including those offered by self-funded companies that pay their workers' claims directly and who were previously exempt from appeals requirements.\\n\\nNo waiting periods to join a plan\\n\\nEmployers used to be able to make new employees wait indefinitely before they were eligible for coverage under the company plan. No more. Now the waiting time for coverage can be no more than 90 days.\\n\\nNo waiting periods for coverage of pre-existing conditions\\n\\nPrior to the ACA, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. Under the ACA, that's no longer allowed. As a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts.\\n\\nRepeal could reopen the door to that prohibited practice, however.\\n\\nStandardized plan descriptions\\n\\nThe law requires all plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage in a standard format that allows consumers to understand their coverage and make apples-to-apples plan comparisons.\\n\\nBasic coverage standards for large-group plans\\n\\nThe health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. They aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. But the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. Those that don't could face a fine.\\n\\nInitially, the online calculator that the federal Department of Health and Human Services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. Now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards.\\n\\nThe result: Large employers generally no longer offer so-called mini-med policies with very skimpy benefits.\\n\\nIf the health law is repealed, that could change. In some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization representing large employers.\\n\\nAlthough the law strengthened coverage for people in large-group plans in several ways, consumer advocates have complained about shortcomings. It aimed to ensure that coverage is affordable by requiring that individuals be responsible for paying no more than 9.69 percent of their household income for individual employer coverage, for example.\\n\\nIf their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits — if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). But the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage.\\n\\nConsumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. The health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent.\\n\\nSuch incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people.\\n\\nIt potentially allows [plans] to discriminate against people with medical conditions, which the ACA is supposed to eliminate, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

{"original": "Biden Ends Trump Census Policy, Ensuring All Persons Living In U.S. Are Counted\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated at 9:44 p.m. ET\\n\\nOne of President Biden's first executive actions has reversed former President Donald Trump's unprecedented policy of altering a key census count by excluding unauthorized immigrants. The change ensures that the U.S. continues to follow more than two centuries of precedent in determining representation in Congress and the Electoral College.\\n\\nHours after he was sworn in as president on Wednesday, Biden signed an executive order that calls for all U.S. residents, in the country legally or not, to be counted in state population numbers that, according to the 14th Amendment, must include the whole number of persons in each state.\\n\\nThe state counts are used once a decade to reallocate each state's share of electoral votes and the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Since the first national head count in 1790, those numbers have never omitted any residents because of immigration status.\\n\\nBiden's order also rescinds an executive order Trump issued in July 2019 as part of a project at the Census Bureau to produce citizenship data using government records as an alternative to Trump's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census forms. Trump's order directed federal agencies to share their records with the bureau, which has been compiling information from agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration, as well as some states' driver's license information.\\n\\nBiden's executive action, however, does not address standing directives issued by now-former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who ordered the bureau to use the records to generate anonymized, block-level data about the U.S. citizenship status of every adult living in the country. It is not clear what will happen to the records the bureau has compiled and any data it has produced.\\n\\nA GOP strategist concluded that data would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites when political mapmakers redraw state and local voting districts, a process that is set to begin again this year. The Census Bureau's public information office did not immediately respond to NPR's questions about the current status of the citizenship data project.\\n\\nThe project is currently facing an ongoing federal lawsuit led by attorneys with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC.\\n\\nTrump's push to exclude unauthorized immigrants from numbers for reapportioning Congress sparked multiple lawsuits after it was issued in July 2020. That plan violates the Constitution and the Census Act and is inconsistent with our nation's history and our commitment to representative democracy, Susan Rice, Biden's domestic policy adviser, said during a press briefing on Tuesday.\\n\\nBiden had been expected to rescind Trump's presidential memo on the census apportionment counts, which Biden condemned shortly after it was announced.\\n\\nLast month, the Supreme Court ruled that it would be premature to decide whether Trump could legally subtract unauthorized immigrants from those numbers. The high court's conservative majority noted in their opinion that the case was riddled with contingencies and speculation.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, Trump's effort had been hampered by the practical challenge of coming up with a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants given the lack of a question about immigration status on the 2020 census forms.\\n\\nDays before Justice Department attorneys confirmed last week that the administration had officially given up on Trump's bid, career officials at the Census Bureau stopped trying to use government records to produce those figures, which were likely to be incomplete and inaccurate.\\n\\nNew state numbers from the 2020 census, which were legally due at the end of last year, have not been released yet because of delays caused by the Trump administration's last-minute schedule changes and the coronavirus pandemic. After uncovering irregularities in the information collected for the count, the Census Bureau is continuing to run quality checks and is not expected to put out results until March 6 at the earliest.\\n\\nCensus advocates have been urging Biden to support extensions to the reporting deadlines that the bureau requested back in April after COVID-19 forced the agency to postpone in-person counting efforts. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who has been serving on the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the bureau, is expected to reintroduce legislation that would formally give the bureau more time.\\n\\nPresident Biden will ensure that the Census Bureau has time to complete an accurate population count for each state, Rice told reporters Tuesday."}

But the actions can be fodder for lawsuits and criticism from political opponents — and can be more easily overturned by future administrations.\\n\\nIn her briefing, Psaki told reporters Biden will have his first call with a foreign leader on Friday when he plans to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\\n\\nTop of mind for the Biden administration is advancing a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package with Congress, something the president has already been discussing with lawmakers.\\n\\nPsaki said Biden prefers to move forward with a bipartisan bill, noting that could require some changes from the initial package.

{"original": "Buttigieg Makes His Pitch To Iowans\\n\\nWith the Iowa caucuses two weeks away, Pete Buttigieg is holding events across the state, making a pitch to people he considers future former Republicans.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidates are darting around Iowa and New Hampshire, hosting town halls and rallies. The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg was largely unknown at the beginning of the campaign. But with two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, hundreds of people now line up to hear him speak in a middle school gym or a veterans hall. NPR's Asma Khalid takes us outside and inside one of his events.\\n\\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: It is bitterly cold, the type of cold where your face hurts - just two degrees outside. You can hear the wind blowing. But here in northern Iowa, despite the cold, despite the snow still in this parking lot, there was a full crowd of people to come hear Pete Buttigieg at a town hall.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hello. Can I get you checked in, sir?\\n\\nKHALID: As soon as you walk in the door, volunteers ask for your contact info. Campaigns traditionally collect this information so they can call you and make sure you show up on caucus day.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Bob, you want a sticker?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Everybody knows you've been checked in.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: There we go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thank you very much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Thank you.\\n\\nKHALID: About 300 people have shown up - some super-fans, some recently committed to Buttigieg and some who are still not sure what to think.\\n\\nSo have you decided who you'll be caucusing for?\\n\\nKIM DOUGHTY: Not for sure. No.\\n\\nKHALID: That's 66-year-old Kim Doughty.\\n\\nDOUGHTY: I think Pete looks like a young Kennedy type. But there is that question about whether he has enough experience. Part of me says he'd make a better vice presidential candidate.\\n\\nKHALID: Twice in one night, I heard people over the age of 65 compare the 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg to John F. Kennedy.\\n\\nALAN STECKMAN: I think we all remember Jack Kennedy fondly.\\n\\nKHALID: Alan Steckman, a 73-year-old retired college professor, is introducing Buttigieg onstage tonight.\\n\\nSTECKMAN: And I consider Mayor Pete as being a Kennedy type. I see him as being young enough to stimulate people who were then my age.\\n\\nKHALID: Polling shows most of the people Buttigieg is stimulating are older voters like Steckman. Younger voters prefer Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. In some ways, it seems that what these voters are saying is that Buttigieg is what a young person ought to be. They praise his military record and his calm demeanor. Buttigieg walks out in a crisp white shirt and blue suit jacket to the 2018 pop hit High Hopes.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PANIC! AT THE DISCO SONG, HIGH HOPES)\\n\\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: Thank you.\\n\\nKHALID: This is his fourth stop of the day. The events are efficient, and the tone is polite. Buttigieg doesn't rattle off specific policy plans or talk much about his personal story. Instead, he talks about a vision. He asks voters to imagine a different future.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: So I want you to picture it in as much detail as you can how it will feel the first day that the sun comes up over Mason City, over Iowa, over America, and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nKHALID: He talks about faith, freedom and patriotism.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: My sense of patriotism, my love of country begins with the understanding that our country consists of people. You can't love a country if you hate half of the people in it.\\n\\nKHALID: And he ends with a message of hope, a clear nod to President Obama.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: 2008, Iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable.\\n\\nKHALID: Buttigieg speaks for 10 to 15 minutes and then takes questions from the audience. A common question he's asked even among mostly white crowds is what he's going to do to gain more support from black voters. His basic response is that people need to get to know him better. But then he adds...\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: There's more work to do. And you know, so many black voters I talk to are feeling frustrated and taken for granted - but not only being kicked around by the Republican Party, but often taken for granted by the Democratic Party.\\n\\nKHALID: Tonight's rally is in a county, like a lot of counties Buttigieg visits, that voted for President Obama and then flipped to President Trump. Buttigieg is trying to make a pitch to people he refers to in his campaign speeches as future former Republicans.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Gentleman in the Trump 2020 hat - let's see if I can make any progress here.\\n\\nKHALID: This is the last question. It's about Social Security and the middle class, nothing too controversial. Buttigieg answers it, and then he leans over to say hello.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I appreciate your coming over and joining.\\n\\nALLAN KINGERY: I think we can come and have just different opinions and still get along without being...\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Exactly.\\n\\nKINGERY: Don't - people don't need to be rude.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Exactly. I hope so. Well, I appreciate...\\n\\nKINGERY: Can I get a picture?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Of course. Yeah.\\n\\nKHALID: The man in the Trump 2020 hat is Allan Kingery. He works at a local egg processing plant, and he says he's most likely going to vote for Trump for reelection. But as different as Buttigieg and Trump might seem, Kingery says he notices one similarity.\\n\\nKINGERY: They got good stage presence. I can see him as being very presidential.\\n\\nKHALID: Buttigieg's rallies are low-drama, but to his fans, they are still electric. He's swarmed by people wanting to shake his hand, get an autograph or take a picture with him.\\n\\nKIM BRACKLEY: I got 10 grandkids coming up, and they need you.\\n\\nKHALID: That last voice talking to Buttigieg is Kim Brackley. In 2016, she liked Bernie Sanders. She says she still likes a lot of the Vermont senator's ideas, but...\\n\\nBRACKLEY: I'm looking for someone, too, that I really think can hold his own against Trump.\\n\\nKHALID: And she thinks Buttigieg has the best bet.\\n\\nBRACKLEY: Mayor Pete is professional.\\n\\nKHALID: As I was about to leave, I noticed Kim Doughty. He's the undecided Iowan I had met earlier who compared Buttigieg to JFK.\\n\\nSo you got any clarity on what you're going to do?\\n\\nDOUGHTY: No. It's more confusing now because I am more impressed.\\n\\nKHALID: But there's still one thing giving him pause about the former mayor of a small city.\\n\\nDOUGHTY: Just the fact that he hasn't been there. It's different.

{"original": "Congress Overturns Trump Veto On Defense Bill After Political Detour\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\\n\\nThe Senate voted Friday to overturn President Trump's veto of the mammoth annual defense bill in an unprecedented act that assures the decades-long continuity for that legislation. It follows a House vote earlier this week.\\n\\nThe Senate vote, 81-13, came after an unusual political detour for the National Defense Authorization Act, which establishes policy and handles myriad other issues for the military services. The popularity of the military, together with the scale of the bill, means it passes virtually every year and has for decades — until this one hit a snag.\\n\\nIt is the first veto override by Congress in the Trump presidency.\\n\\nTrump's objections\\n\\nCongress, with bipartisan agreement, included provisions in the bill that would rename military bases and other facilities that have Confederate names. The support for that gesture followed this year's national movement on behalf of racial equality and police reform following the deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and other Black citizens at the hands of police.\\n\\nTrump, however, supports preserving the names of figures such as Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee, Braxton Bragg and others on Army bases and other military infrastructure that now bear them. The president dismissed his last Senate-confirmed defense secretary, Mark Esper, in part over a split on that issue.\\n\\nSo Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act and also complained that Democrats wouldn't agree to a deal that might include the removal of some legal protections for Big Tech companies.\\n\\nThe president's choices were called an act of staggering recklessness by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who led the House in overturning the veto on Monday. And Trump's intransigence led to awkward politics for his ostensible allies, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who arranged the Senate's vote on Friday.\\n\\nUnlikely allies — and foes\\n\\ntoggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\\n\\nTrump not only put McConnell and majority Republicans into the position of needing to overturn a presidential veto. But the president also came out against the position McConnell and his members took on direct cash payments to qualified Americans as coronavirus relief.\\n\\nThat put Trump, Pelosi and Democrats onto the same side and required McConnell to arrange an outcome in which he quashed the higher payments but also ensured the passage of the defense bill — on, as it transpired, a national holiday when many Americans are paying more attention to celebrations and hangovers than congressional byplay.\\n\\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont led a bid to hold up the defense bill to force action on the relief payments, but that fizzled.\\n\\nMcConnell torpedoed the higher relief payments with a measure on Thursday that chained them to issues he knew Democrats wouldn't support, including the Big Tech legal revisions and the prospect for a commission that would sustain Trump's baseless claims about widespread election impropriety.\\n\\nThe majority leader also said the support Congress already has authorized was generous enough and, in his telling, sending out more cash only would help the well-off.\\n\\nThe Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of the Democrats' rich friends who don't need the help, he said. We just approved almost $1 trillion in aid a few days ago. It struck a balance between broad support for all kinds of households and a lot more targeted relief for those who need help most.\\n\\nThe coronavirus relief package that Trump signed on Sunday includes $600 for qualified Americans; he and Democrats pushed for that to increase to $2,000."}

The government sends many of them to an emergency intake shelter in South Florida. That facility has come under intense scrutiny because it's the only child shelter for immigrants that's run by a for-profit corporation and the only one that isn't overseen by state regulators.\\n\\nThe Homestead temporary influx facility is the biggest and most controversial shelter for migrant children in the country. Critics say the government is warehousing kids in a makeshift prison camp. But on a recent tour, the shelter director took pains to show a different perspective.\\n\\nThe kids, ages 13 to 17, live in sand-colored dormitories, amid palm trees and bougainvillea, inside a fenced campus next to Homestead Air Reserve Base, south of Miami. The tour guide showed off the soccer field, the phone-home room, the medical clinic and the school classrooms. She described holiday parties, talent shows and pizza and ice cream for good behavior.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Burnett/NPR John Burnett/NPR\\n\\nThe young immigrants, mostly from Central America, receive health and dental checkups, new clothes and hygiene kits. They're assigned a case manager with whom they work to get released to an adult sponsor.\\n\\nDiscipline is strict. The teenagers walk single file in groups of 12, escorted by a youth-care worker. They smile at a visitor and call out hola when greeted.\\n\\nBut that's all a reporter ever hears.\\n\\nOn these visits, journalists are not permitted to record anything, take photographs, or speak to the children. It's for the minors' privacy and protection, officials say.\\n\\nAttorneys see traumatized children\\n\\nSeveral days after the tour, a group of attorneys agrees to sit down and describe their interviews with two dozen of the migrant children. They have been granted access to these shelters by a federal judge to oversee the welfare of unaccompanied kids in federal custody.\\n\\nWe see a very different picture than the reporters see.\\n\\nWe see a very different picture, says Leecia Welch, senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law. We see extremely traumatized children, some of whom sit across from us and can't stop crying over what they're experiencing.\\n\\nShe continues, We hear stories of children who are told from the first day of their orientation that under no circumstances can they touch another child in the facility, even their own sibling, even friends who they're saying goodbye to after many months of shared intense experience. They can't hug them goodbye. If they do, they're told they will be written up and it could affect their immigration case.\\n\\nWelch concludes, We see a very different picture than the reporters see.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\\n\\nCosts over $1 million per day\\n\\nHomestead is like no other federal children's shelter in America. Not only is it the biggest — it has been contracted to receive up to 2,350 kids — it's the only youth sanctuary operated for a profit.\\n\\nThe operator is Comprehensive Health Services. The Florida-based company dispatched medical teams to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, to Haiti after the earthquake, and to Balad Air Base in Iraq. And in 2016, it entered the migrant shelter business. The current Homestead contract with the Department of Health and Human Services is worth up to $220 million.\\n\\nThe average daily cost to care for a child at an influx facility is about $775 a day, according to Evelyn Stauffer, press secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. With nearly 1,600 children at Homestead, that puts the burn rate at over $1.2 million a day.\\n\\nThe average cost for a migrant child at one of the 130 smaller, permanent shelters contracted to HHS is about a third of that.\\n\\nThe cost of a temporary shelter is significantly higher because of the need to develop facilities quickly and hire significant staff over a short period of time, Stauffer wrote in an email to NPR.\\n\\nJonathan Hayes is the acting director and chief of staff of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the shelter network. At times due to just migration patterns, he explains, there is a need to have temporary influx shelters such as Homestead. I'd rather have capacity available and not need it, than to need it and not have it.\\n\\nChild custody as a for-profit industry\\n\\nImmigrant advocates fear that America's prison-industrial complex is now expanding into federal child custody.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, it's the first for-profit child detention center, says Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition. So just let that sink in.\\n\\nCompany executives declined to be interviewed. But a Comprehensive Health Services vice president said in an email that the safety and welfare of unaccompanied minors at the Homestead facility is a top priority and that they follow all laws and every new hire is fully screened.\\n\\nIn announcing its initial public offering in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last fall, Homestead's parent company, Caliburn International, states that the Trump administration's border enforcement and immigration policy ... is driving significant growth. The company also warns investors that the challenging and politically charged environment could adversely impact our share price.\\n\\nCaliburn's SEC filings make it clear that they understand the controversial nature of the policies that they are benefiting from, says Kevin Connor, director of Public Accountability Initiative, a watchdog research group that has looked into Caliburn's IPO.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\\n\\nMore than 5,000 migrant children in January\\n\\nMeanwhile, the migrant kids keep coming.\\n\\nIn January, the Border Patrol reported more than 5,000 unaccompanied alien children apprehended at the border, almost all from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\\n\\nOnce in federal custody, they are sent to Homestead or to one of the 130 smaller permanent shelters. ORR insists that its mission is child welfare, not immigrant detention, which is the responsibility of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nJonathan Hayes of ORR says the shelter facilities are a far better environment than the austere holding cells at the border.\\n\\nThe main mission is to ensure kids are not stuck in true detention facilities and cages in Border Patrol stations. That's the goal of all of us here at ORR and our grantees. We want to get these kids into our shelters as safely and quickly as possible, without delay, he says.\\n\\nBut immigrant advocates say the kids are kept at those shelters for too long — an average of 67 days at Homestead — before they're released to live with a sponsor and wait for a court date. And they want the facility closed.\\n\\nNow Democrats have introduced legislation in Congress that would do just that. It's called the Shut Down Child Prison Camps Act.\\n\\nAnother sprawling emergency shelter, the Tornillo tent camp in the West Texas desert, closed last month amid incendiary criticism and the nonprofit operator's desire not to renew the contract.\\n\\nThere is absolutely no basis for detaining children at an influx facility for months and months on end, says Neha Desai, director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\\n\\nHomestead is unique because it's a temporary overflow facility on federal property. That means the shelter doesn't have to be licensed by the state and follow Florida child care standards, though it does have to comply with federal regulations.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\\n\\nEducational services?\\n\\nBeing on federal land also means the shelter does not have to be part of the local public school system. The shelter director says the children receive proper educational services, and showed a reporter an instructor teaching English to a full classroom. But Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, says there's no way to verify the quality of education.\\n\\nFor me this is personal, he says, explaining how he came to the U.S. as an unaccompanied immigrant from Portugal at age 17. He rose to become chief of the nation's fourth-largest school district, which is predominantly immigrant. Now he's angry that the federal government is telling him he cannot inspect Homestead's classrooms.\\n\\nFor me to now be running a school system and not take a position to fight for the educational rights of kids, regardless of immigration status, would be the equivalent of me turning my back on myself, Carvalho says.\\n\\nBut all the criticism hasn't hurt business.\\n\\nIn the past two weeks, Comprehensive Health Services has been issued new state licenses for three permanent shelters in South Texas to hold 500 migrant children for the U.S. government."}

The Knight First Amendment Institute has filed a lawsuit saying the president's Twitter feed is a public forum protected by the First Amendment.\\n\\nThe suit, filed Tuesday, accuses the White House of suppressing dissent by excluding Twitter users who criticize Trump or his policies. It cites recent statements by White House staff that deem tweets from the president's @realDonaldTrump account as official statements, as well as a recent Supreme Court opinion that called Twitter and Facebook perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed by seven people who have been blocked from Trump's account, along with the Knight First Amendment Institute, which is affiliated with Columbia University. The group initially threatened to sue a month ago, when it sent the White House a letter demanding that it stop blocking people who respond critically to the president's messages.\\n\\nIn addition to preventing those citizens from reading and responding to the president's tweets, the group said, the practice violates others' rights to an open forum where they can hear critical debate.

{"original": "Why There Are So Many Different Guidelines For Face Masks For The Public\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michal Cizek/AFP via Getty Images Michal Cizek/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nOn Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\\n\\nSeriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9 — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020\\n\\nAbout a month later, on Friday, April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans wear cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials ... as an additional, voluntary public health measure.\\n\\nThis isn't the only example of a change or updating of mask-wearing policies during the coronavirus crisis. It's happened in countries around the world — from Singapore to Austria to Kenya (which just announced one of the world's strictest policies — police are arresting anyone caught without a mask in their vehicle, on a bus or in a public place.)\\n\\nMeanwhile, some health agencies have taken a stand that calls for mask-wearing in public from the early stages of the outbreak — Hong Kong on Jan. 24, mainland China on Jan. 31.\\n\\ntoggle caption Stringer for NPR\\n\\nTo understand why mask guidelines have been so varied, NPR reached out to specialists in academia and in government. What we learned is that face mask guidelines are about science — but go beyond. The reasons for a policy may have to do with practical considerations like the national supply of masks but may also reflect cultural values and history.\\n\\nShifting Guidelines\\n\\nIn order to understand the range of guidelines, the first issue to consider is the data on the potential benefits of masks. As with so many points surrounding the novel coronavirus, there's not a clear-cut finding.\\n\\nBut there is emerging research and data that suggests transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Such research has been coming out at least since February; the latest report is from Singapore on April 1. These studies emphasize that people can spread the virus before realizing that they are sick — and that wearing a mask in public could help keep the infected person from spreading infectious droplets.\\n\\nAmong the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers. That's why the World Health Organization has stayed consistent in its recommendation, Margaret Harris of its coronavirus response team told NPR. And that position is: yes to masks for health-care workers and people with symptoms, no for the general public.\\n\\nWHO and other agencies have also raised concerns about the potential problems that could arise due to the wearing of a mask — for example, a false sense of security that would undermine other preventive measures or self-contamination from touching a contaminated mask.\\n\\nEpidemiologist Sergio Brusin who works on the European Center for Disease Control's coronavirus response, offered NPR a similar rationale in an interview. However, ECDC only mentioned that face masks aren't effective in protecting the wearer on its public-facing website. A number of other health agencies — like WHO and the CDC — offered little explanation on their website.\\n\\nThe result of these sometimes incomplete messages: I think that if you talk to even the highly informed members of the general public and ask[ed] them a week, or two or three weeks ago, if the face masks work, they would say 'no' because they would have read CDC guidance, WHO guidance, says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Center on National & Global Health Law.\\n\\nBut that wouldn't have been correct. Based upon the science [about potential benefits of masks for the public] we knew at the time.\\n\\nGovernments should not have downplayed the importance of face masks [as a protective measure for the public], says Leiyu Shi, who researches comparative health systems and health policy at Johns Hopkins University, because it will make them [seem] very foolish when they change their stance. Again and again, Shi says.\\n\\nIn response to NPR's inquiry about its April 3 guideline change, the CDC said its change was driven by increasing and widespread transmission of the new coronavirus across the country, citing studies published in February and March showing pre-symptomatic and a symptomatic spread. A CDC spokesperson also noted reports from Asian countries showing that a cloth face covering can reduce the chance of spreading respiratory droplets when people need to be in places with others.\\n\\nAsked by NPR about the Surgeon General's earlier tweet about the ineffectiveness of masks, the office of the Surgeon General issued a statement Thursday noting that back in February Dr. Adams was following the CDC, WHO and other health organizations, which all recommended against wearing masks as a way to protect the person wearing them. The statement said that the understanding on spread from infected individuals who have not shown symptoms has since changed.\\n\\nThe Impact Of SARS On Mask Guidance\\n\\nFor Jeremy Lim, Adjunct Associate professor of public health from the National University of Singapore School of Public Health, East Asia's threshold for taking action on face masks and more potentially preventive measures was sparked by SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus that swept through the region in 2003.\\n\\nPolicymakers will always have to live with uncertainty and incomplete information,' Lim says. For East Asian countries, the attitude was 'better to be safe than to be sorry.' \\n\\nAsked about the new CDC position in the U.S., public health academics like Gostin and Shi believe the guideline changes in the U.S. could have come sooner, given the emerging evidence of potential benefits.\\n\\ntoggle caption Helmut Fohringer/APA/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nBut it's not that simple just to issue guidelines based on science, noted many of the experts interviewed by NPR. Before issuing guidelines, governments also weigh how likely the public would be to follow them, they said.\\n\\ntoggle caption Laurel Chor for NPR\\n\\nThe existing culture of mask-wearing helped Asian societies in this regard — and is partly a legacy of SARS. After surviving the outbreak 17 years ago, many people in this part of the world began wearing masks even if they just had a cold — to protect others but also for a sense of being protected from others, even if there isn't scientific data to back that up.\\n\\nThe mask is almost like a talisman, says Harris of the WHO's coronavirus response team. People feel more secure and protected.\\n\\nThe culture is different in Europe and the U.S., where people are less familiar with the idea of wearing a mask to protect others. People may think the face mask wearers they see want to be protected from them, Harris says.\\n\\nTo change the culture regarding masks or any other public health intervention, the U.S. needs to issue consistent messages from many different levels of government, says Ross Brownson, professor of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis. He researched how research is translated into evidence-based policies.\\n\\nThis is because some listen to the scientists or the Dr. Faucis [the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] of the world. There's another group that will listen to their local mayor. There's another group who might resonate with the governor. There's another group that might listen to President Trump. Brownson says.\\n\\nBrownson, Shi and Gostin all say that the heads of government should lead by example, practicing what they preach.\\n\\nIt would be a complete shock to the American public to see widespread face mask use, says Gostin. And I would like to see our leadership doing it to model that good behavior.\\n\\nPresident Trump said last Friday, after the CDC updated guidelines were announced, that he would not follow them: Sitting in the oval office, behind that beautiful resolute desk, the great resolute desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don't know, somehow I don't see it for myself.\\n\\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nThe president's, you know, an awfully powerful person. And if he doesn't think he needs it, why should I? Gostin says.\\n\\nDifferent societies, different cultures\\n\\nThe matter of masks is also tied up with the willingness of citizens to heed advice from the government.\\n\\nIn South Korea, for instance, or even Singapore, a recommendation from the government is taken really literally and in a very stringent way, says Brusin of ECDC. Other sources interviewed for this story suggest that is because there may be more trust in government than in western societies.\\n\\nOther countries know that they have to communicate more to convince the citizens to abide by the values, recommendations, and culture has an influence into that, Brusin adds.\\n\\nAmerica is a fiercely individualistic country, says Gostin, where many might feel you couldn't force me to wear a mask. Other researchers agreed with his assessment.\\n\\nBut the mask-wearing policies in other country do not necessarily reflect a more authoritian government, say some of NPR's interviewees. Perhaps we have a bit too glibly dismissed the Chinese approach by saying that it's an authoritarian system. Lim says, People are obedient, but it's really not about being [in] authoritarian [systems]. It's fundamentally accepting that society comes before self and putting the greater good ahead of one's own interests.\\n\\nAnd even while discussion of public mask-wearing continues, the academics interviewed for this article agree that social distancing is the most important measure the public can take to fight the virus.\\n\\ntoggle caption Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images\\n\\nSe Eun Gong contributed reporting from Seoul.

But the plan, which also would also immediately protect millions of people from being deported, marks a dramatic shift from President Trump's hardline policies that made life increasingly more difficult for people living in the country without legal status.\\n\\nThis legislation provides new pathways to citizenship, promotes smart border controls, and ... addresses the root causes of migration, said Susan Rice, Biden's incoming domestic policy adviser, on a call with reporters previewing the new administration's Day 1 actions.\\n\\nThe bill also creates an earned path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers and essential workers who risk their lives to serve and protect American communities, she said.\\n\\nThe proposal calls for a fast-track to citizenship for young Dreamer immigrants brought to the country by their parents, as well as certain farm workers and past recipients of Temporary Protected Status — such as people who fled wars. This group would be able to get green cards immediately and could apply for citizenship after three years.\\n\\nOther undocumented immigrants could apply for green cards after five years, and then three years afterward could apply for citizenship. In all cases, immigrants would need to pass background checks and pay their taxes.\\n\\nThe Biden administration is under pressure from immigration activists to take broad steps to protect those in the United States illegally, concerned that Biden won't move fast enough on campaign pledges. Their unease dates back to 2008 when the Obama administration pursued priorities other than immigration reform early in his term when Democrats held the majority in both the House and Senate.\\n\\nBiden's plan would focus on family reunification and also increase the diversity visa program, which the Trump administration sought to eliminate, boosting available spots to 80,000 visa per year, up from 55,000 visas.\\n\\nThe bill also calls for $4 billion to be spent over four years on aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to help the nations address problems spurring migration to the United States.\\n\\nThe bill also would replace the term alien in U.S. immigration laws with noncitizen.\\n\\nBiden's incoming team said it plans to boost technology at the border to increase security, among other measures, but there were few immediate details. Officials briefing reporters did not say whether the plan would propose more funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which enforces much of the country's immigration laws.\\n\\nOne official said there is currently $26 billion allocated for immigration enforcement right now, and said it would be up to Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's Cabinet nominee for the Department for Homeland Security, on how best to spend that money.\\n\\nSeparate from the bill, Biden also plans to sign executive actions on Wednesday to reverse Trump's travel ban on a group of primarily Muslim nations, repeal Trump's hardline immigration enforcement orders, stop construction of his wall on the southern border with Mexico, among other measures."}

It's shorthand for too aggressive, too liberated, too selfish. Yet women in Rwanda hold 64 percent of the seats in parliament — more than any other country.\\n\\nWhat he found is that even in a country that seemingly embraces gender equality, there are invisible forces — belief systems and cultural traditions — that may shape society's view of how a woman should behave, what it means to exercise her rights and how far she should push her boundaries.\\n\\nThat made us curious: What does it mean to be a feminist in different countries around the world?

We'll share some of the submissions in a post on Goats and Soda next week.\\n\\nTo get the conversation started, we asked a few folks from our global audience to express their views. Some declined to respond because they didn't consider themselves a feminist. Here are some of the comments we received, edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nZambia: Being a girl was not a reason to fail\\n\\nBeing a feminist to me is recognizing that though we have equal rights, there are certain circumstances when as a woman I will need to work harder for the same pay or recognition as a man.\\n\\nMy mother was a professor in education policy and gender studies and taught me the positive aspects of our culture that foster self-confidence. When I was growing up, the bar was set very high for achieving success. Being a girl was not a reason to fail.\\n\\nJacqueline Musiitwa, 34, lawyer\\n\\nParaguay: Both men and women need to work to advance it\\n\\nWhen Paraguayans think of feminism, I think they think of outspoken, independent and even rebellious women. But for me, feminism is about the equality of the genders. I think both men and women need to work to advance it.\\n\\nSocial attitudes are hard to change due to the strong influence of the national and regional culture of machismo. Men have been typically seen as the breadwinners, while women have been seen as homemakers, solely in charge of raising children and teaching them manners. In recent years, economic growth and democracy in Paraguay have helped things move along.\\n\\nJulia Corvalan, 34, strategy adviser at social enterprise Fundacion Paraguaya\\n\\nIndia: For me, it's about dignity for both sexes\\n\\nFeminists in India are often seen as being arrogant, aggressive and offensive. Feminism, generally, is a negative concept and is associated with radical views. But to me it's about dignity for both sexes, not about establishing superiority over one another. It's not about asking for special treatment, but equal treatment.\\n\\nGrowing up, I experienced how Indian society discriminates between girl and boy children. It's reflected in the number of girls allowed to be born and sent to school, and what is expected of them in domestic work. Economic changes are sweeping this country today, but social changes are not keeping pace. For example, with the Delhi rape case, it was disheartening to see that blame the victim culture prevails. Political leaders were saying boys will be boys. We need to change patriarchal mindsets and attitudes at all levels.\\n\\nRanjitha Puskur, 48, agricultural researcher\\n\\nThe Philippines: Feminism is a way to discard the machismo values instilled by the colonizers\\n\\nI grew up surrounded by strong women: my grandma and my aunts. I also attended an all-girls Catholic school and a university renowned for its activism. We were always made to think that our opinions mattered, that we mattered. I was encouraged to embrace my femininity, seeing it not as a weakness, but a strength.\\n\\nThe Philippines is a patriarchal, machismo society — but the family is where the matriarch rules. The trend of [Filipino] women leaving their families to work abroad as nurses, caregivers and nannies disrupted the family system. That was a big eye-opener for a lot of Filipinos: The roles are reversed, and the women are the sole providers for the family.\\n\\nThis shift back toward a matriarchal society has roots [in the Philippines] before the Spanish colonization. In my eyes, feminism is a way to discard the machismo values instilled by the colonizers.\\n\\nYana Gilbuena, 32, chef\\n\\nTrinidad and Tobago: Women are valued for all the differences we bring to the table\\n\\nWe recently had our first woman prime minister. I never heard her qualifications questioned on the basis of her gender.

{"original": "Former Presidential Candidate Evan McMullin On Centerist Politics\\n\\nNPR's Scott Simon talks to Evan McMullin, an independent presidential candidate in the 2016 campaign, about the place for centrist politics in the U.S. political landscape.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nWe continue to follow the situation in North Korea. Last night, President Trump spoke by phone with China's president, Xi Jinping, who urged both sides to dial back their rhetoric about fire, fury and missile threats. We're going to turn now to Evan McMullin, the former CIA officer and Republican staffer who ran against President Trump last fall, criticizing his temperament and qualifications. He won about 700,000 votes. Mr. McMullin has continued to speak out. He's in Philadelphia this weekend for a meeting of the Centrist Project, which urges qualified independents to run for office at all levels. He's co-founder of the group Stand Up Republic. Mr. McMullin, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nEVAN MCMULLIN: Great to be with you, Scott. Thanks for having me.\\n\\nSIMON: It's traditional for Americans from all parties to support the president in time of crisis. What do you think of President Trump's statements and actions surrounding North Korea?\\n\\nMCMULLIN: Well, I would say that I do support a harder line with North Korea. Presidents of both parties for decades have tried a more traditional diplomatic approach with the Kim regime unsuccessfully. They do present, I believe, a threat to U.S. and global security. But I've questioned whether Donald Trump's rhetoric has been part of the smartest, wisest strategy. And I also would advocate for a little more caution around some of the red lines and threats that the president is drawing now. I think a much more productive approach is to increase the cost of the status quo for China in North Korea so that China can be then more inspired to do more to rein in that regime.\\n\\nSIMON: But you spent years at the CIA.\\n\\nMCMULLIN: Yes.\\n\\nSIMON: What's your realistic assessment. Is? There any policy the U.S. can pursue that would prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons if that's what they want to do and if that's what the regime feel it has to do to stay in power?\\n\\nMCMULLIN: You're exactly right. That is the primary motivation for the Kim regime in pursuit of nuclear weapons - is to preserve its power. And so the goal then, if - the goal has to be to change the way they think about the best way to do that. Right now they think the best way to do that is to develop nuclear weapons. It's understandable that they would think that, by the way. It's a rational conclusion, but we have to change that dynamic. And the only way we can really do that is with a lot more help from China. And so that's got to be the approach. China provides most of North Korea's energy and other support - humanitarian, et cetera. And we've got to change the dynamic there so that the regime actually fears, you know, its demise through lack of that support rather than through its lack of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nSIMON: A tough question - but I think it's on the minds - a lot of Americans have expressed this over the past few days. Do you, Mr. McMullin, trust President Trump with U.S. military power, including nuclear weapons?\\n\\nMCMULLIN: I can't say that I completely trust him with that awesome power. No. I'm sorry to say that. But I would say that there - he does have good people around him. I know General Mattis. I have confidence in him. And there are others around the president like that. And I'm hopeful that they will help prevent any terribly unwise actions.\\n\\nSIMON: Let me give you a chance to talk about the Centrist Project, too. I'm not quite clear, having read your website, if it's a movement or a party.\\n\\nMCMULLIN: It's more akin to a movement, although I'm not exactly sure I would call it quite that at this point. It's more a coordinated effort between potential independent candidates and those who would support them to drive change in American politics.\\n\\nSIMON: You might be an independent candidate for something, I gather.\\n\\nMCMULLIN: It's possible. I do believe that I'll run again. Of course, the next opportunity for that would be in 2018. It is possible. I just haven't made the decision yet.\\n\\nSIMON: Evan McMullin, thanks so much for being with us, sir.\\n\\nMCMULLIN: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Fire Engulfs Brazil's National Museum\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nWhen a building is destroyed by fire, there are certain losses that even the best insurance policy cannot possibly replace. And that is surely true at Brazil's National Museum in Rio de Janeiro. A fire destroyed much of the 200-year-old building and much of the artwork inside. NPR's Philip Reeves is in Rio. Hi, Phil.\\n\\nPHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi.\\n\\nINSKEEP: How did this fire start?\\n\\nREEEVES: Well, it started around 7:30 last night local time. The museum was closed. The building's got a lot of wood and paper in it and stuff, and so this flame spread with astonishing speed and engulfed much of the building. And pretty soon, there were flames 30 foot high soaring up into the night sky. The fire department says it got the blaze under control at around 3 a.m. today. Aerial footage shows very considerable damage. Firefighters are actually still working through the building this morning, and we don't know what the cause was yet, Steve.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Yeah. The images - you see fire, you see flame at virtually every window. There doesn't seem to be any roof left. There's flames and smoke coming out of the top of the building, maybe nothing left but the stone walls. What was in that museum?\\n\\nREEEVES: Oh, it had a pretty impressive collection, items not just of importance to Latin America but globally, a huge range of things, you know, from the world of art, zoology, anthropology. There was a collection of Egyptian mummies. There were Greek and Roman treasures collected by emperors over the ages. There were insects gathered by jungle explorers and dinosaur bones and paintings and photographs. And there was Luzia. That's the nickname given to the skeleton - the remains of a woman who was found in a cave in Brazil in the 1970s. She's an estimated 11,500 years old, and that makes her one of the oldest human skeletons ever found in the Americas.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Goodness. And I suppose if this fire broke out after closing, there wouldn't even have been staff available to maybe grab the most valuable things and run. Did anything survive?\\n\\nREEEVES: Well, the fire department says that they were able to save some pieces. We don't know what and how much at this stage. And we also do know, Steve, that not all of the collection was kept within the areas of the building that were consumed by fire. So that's the good news. But, you know, everyone here is very, very worried that much has been lost. The president of Brazil, Michel Temer, has talked about an incalculable loss, as he puts it, that's - still quoting him - destroyed 2,000 years of research and work and knowledge.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I'm just thinking of what a tragedy it would be if one of the buildings of the Smithsonian here in Washington were to burn down or the Met in New York City. How are Brazilians responding?\\n\\nREEEVES: Well, you know, the fire was still in its fairly early stages when the recriminations started. Over the specific circumstances, a spokesman for the fire department says that at first efforts to fight the blaze were slow because several fire hydrants near the museum didn't work, so they had to get water from the nearby lake. But there were also recriminations concerning the larger issues here. The building was in terrible repair, you know, and people are asking, why was it allowed to get that dilapidated? The museum staff had talked of being chronically underfunded. That's thanks partly to Brazil's financial crisis which the country's still struggling to recover from. So this is getting political. ALLnd of course there's a big election, a presidential election, next month. And so it's bound to become an issue there, too.\\n\\nINSKEEP: NPR's Philip Reeves is in Rio de Janeiro, where the National Museum burned. Philip, thanks very much.\\n\\nREEEVES: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Coronavirus: Israel Will Require Quarantine For Everyone Entering The Country\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amir Cohen/Reuters Amir Cohen/Reuters\\n\\nIsrael is taking the extraordinary step of requiring a 14-day quarantine for anyone entering the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday. Israel has reported nearly 40 cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\\n\\nIn a brief video announcing the new policy, Netanyahu said the decision was a difficult one to make. He added that the policy will force people flying into Israel to enter a two-week home quarantine period and that it will be in effect for two weeks.\\n\\nThe requirement for visitors to Israel will be implemented on Thursday. The blanket policy is believed to be the first in the world in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has now killed more than 3,800 people around the globe.\\n\\nForeign nationals who cannot self-quarantine will be refused entry, NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem. He adds, All Israelis returning from abroad must self-quarantine.\\n\\nIsraeli Health Minister Yaakov Litzman had predicted the move earlier Monday, calling it a necessary step. He also dismissed reports in Israeli media that portrayed the declaration as a concession to the United States, making the quarantine universal so as not to appear to single out a staunch ally of Israel.\\n\\nThat allegation was fake news, Litzman said, according to The Times of Israel.\\n\\nOne day before announcing the policy, Netanyahu spoke by phone with Vice President Pence, who is leading the Trump administration's U.S. coronavirus effort. On Monday, the vice president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Israeli policy.\\n\\nThere are more than 110,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, according to a dashboard created by Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering. Local transmission of the coronavirus that causes the disease has now been reported in at least 56 countries, the World Health Organization says."}
{"original": "'Failing Patients': Baltimore Video Highlights Crisis Of Emergency Psychiatric Care\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jared Soares for NPR Jared Soares for NPR\\n\\nA viral video from Baltimore is drawing attention to a crisis that's unfolding in emergency rooms across the country: Surging numbers of patients with psychiatric conditions aren't receiving the care they need.\\n\\nOn a cold night in January, a man walking by a downtown Baltimore hospital saw something that shocked him. He started recording the incident on his phone.\\n\\nImamu Baraka's video, which has been viewed more than 3 million times, shows security guards walking away from a bus stop next to the emergency room of University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus.\\n\\nOne is pushing an empty wheelchair. The woman they left there is wearing a thin yellow hospital gown and socks.\\n\\nWait, so you're just going to leave this lady out here with no clothes on? Baraka asks the guards. They continue walking away.\\n\\nThe woman, later identified as a 22-year-old named Rebecca, staggers near the bus stop. She appears distressed and confused. She moans and shouts.\\n\\nAre you OK, ma'am? Do you need me to call the police? Baraka asks.\\n\\nNationwide, hospitals are struggling to provide services to people with psychiatric emergencies. Between 2006 and 2013, ER visits increased by more than 50 percent for psychoses and bipolar disorders and depression, anxiety and stress reactions according to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which compiles health care data. Between those years the number of visits climbed from 3,448 visits to 5,330 per 100,000 U.S. patients ages 15 and older.\\n\\nWe're just failing patients with mental illness and it's just getting worse as time goes on, says Dr. John Rogers, president-elect of the American College of Emergency Physicians.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David McFadden/AP David McFadden/AP\\n\\nIn the viral video, Rebecca has a visible wound on her forehead, and her breath forms white clouds in the cold. Baraka calls for an ambulance, which brings her back to the hospital that just discharged her.\\n\\nRebecca's mother, Cheryl Chandler, says she happened to click on the video, not knowing it showed her daughter. Once he focused on her face I realized it was her. And I think I went into shock initially, Chandler says.\\n\\nThat realization set off a desperate search. The hospital wouldn't tell her where she was. Chandler called the police. They found out that the hospital didn't readmit Rebecca, even though according to a federal regulator's report, Rebecca told workers in the ambulance, I do not feel normal, and do not know what normal is.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Imamu Baraka/Reuters Imamu Baraka/Reuters\\n\\nHospital staff put her into a cab that took her to a nearby homeless shelter, where family members found her the next day. She's been hospitalized on and off since the incident.\\n\\nShe could have got hypothermia. She could have died. She could have been raped, she could have been killed, Chandler says. All she wanted was treatment and they had two opportunities to do it and denied it both times.\\n\\nRebecca was clearly asking for medical care, her mother says, which ERs are legally required to provide.\\n\\nThat, what I saw in the video, was my worst nightmare for Rebecca, Chandler says. Several years ago, Rebecca was diagnosed with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. Her mom adds that she's a shy and lovable introvert who loves animals and making art.\\n\\nRebecca has insurance and had been in a residential home when she went missing, Chandler says.\\n\\nThe hospital has apologized and says it has already put in place measures to correct the issues.\\n\\nChandler says she hopes that means it won't happen to other patients. But she adds that Rebecca will continue to suffer from the hospital's decisions: No part of Rebecca, because of this, is going to heal. No part. We can't make the scars go away.\\n\\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Cheryl Chandler\\n\\nJames E. Farmer, a lawyer for Rebecca's family, says they're investigating now and considering filing lawsuits. It's going to be difficult to determine the exact extent of harm to Rebecca, he says. I could not imagine the psychological damage and harm that was done as a result of this.\\n\\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says the hospital failed to discharge the patient safely, among other breaches.\\n\\nAccording to the federal regulator's report, Rebecca was resistant to discharge and refused to get dressed into street clothes when requested by nursing. The hospital stated there was a communication failure which led to her discharge into the cold weather, though the report says it is not clear whether nursing or security staff made that decision.\\n\\nChandler says she's heard from other families with similar stories: The only difference is it wasn't caught on video.\\n\\nThey told me to leave\\n\\nHere's another story from Baltimore, about Laura Pogliano and her son Zaccaria. Zac, who had schizophrenia, died in 2015 of heart failure when he was 23.\\n\\nZac was sensitive and empathetic, and loved playing the piano, his mother says. He started to show symptoms of the disease when he was 16. He became paranoid, and started doing things like hiding kitchen implements out of fear that someone was trying to kill his family.\\n\\ntoggle caption Eslah Attar/NPR\\n\\nHis personality just drastically changed, Pogliano says. He had a thousand rituals around things so that he wasn't harmed.\\n\\nThen, as part of his illness, Zac started to think that he actually did have dramatic injuries. Like a gunshot wound or a pulverized ankle. He'd call 911.\\n\\nHe got to the point where he would pick up the phone at the drop of a hat and say, can someone come and help me, I'm having a heart attack, Pogliano says.\\n\\nThis happened about 20 times in the two years before his death, she says. Often, ambulances took Zac to Good Samaritan Hospital, where Pogliano says the doctors would typically call her to let her know he arrived and would provide appropriate care for him. Later, hospital staff would call her to pick him up.\\n\\nBut one night after Zac went to the ER, Pogliano woke up hours later and got worried that she hadn't received a call.\\n\\nI just got in the car and drove over there, and he was sitting outside. It was early spring but it was still wintery, probably 40 degrees out, 45 degrees out, she says.\\n\\ntoggle caption Eslah Attar/NPR\\n\\nAll he had on was what he wore to the hospital, which was a pair of white linen shorts. I know he didn't have shoes on. ... And a hospital gown and no shirt. I said to him, 'Oh my gosh, what are you doing here?' He said, 'They told me to leave.' \\n\\nA hospital spokeswoman acknowledged that Pogliano was a patient there but says she found no indication that he was ever inappropriately evaluated or mistreated. She says she couldn't comment further because of federal privacy laws.\\n\\nEmergency room doctors are frustrated at the growing gap in care for patients with psychiatric disabilities.\\n\\nWe're kind of tired of waiting for legislators and regulators to act and to meet their responsibility to these patients in the form of providing funding for resources, says Rogers, the president-elect of the American College of Emergency Physicians.\\n\\nEven as there is increasing demand, there are fewer resources to care for psychiatric patients. It can be difficult for doctors to find an inpatient bed — the numbers are have decreased dramatically over the decades. Rogers says there have been significant cuts to community and outpatient resources — so the emergency department is often the only place for psychiatric patients to go.\\n\\nEvery emergency physician in the country knows this problem well and wants to do something about it, Rogers says.\\n\\nOften the ER is not properly equipped with staff that can offer treatment to psychiatric patients. The emergency room's mission is to assess and stabilize, but the actual care they can provide psychiatric patients is fairly limited. A 2008 survey of ER doctors found that 62 percent of them said there were no psychiatric services provided while the patients were in the ER.\\n\\ntoggle caption Jared Soares for NPR\\n\\nAnd the disparity between our ability to care for a patient with a medical problem and a patient with a psychiatric problem is growing, that gap is increasing, Rogers says.\\n\\nHe says Rebecca's case is an outlier. More common, he says, is that ERs will hold patients for too long before they can transfer them somewhere that can treat them. In a recent poll of emergency physicians, 84 percent said that psychiatric patients are boarded in their departments for hours or days. Rogers says he's heard of patients being held for weeks.\\n\\nAnd the options for where to transfer them are often limited. And that's where it starts breaking down, he says. The time that it takes to get someone transferred for something like that is just unacceptable....They wait, and wait, and wait.\\n\\nIt's a bad situation for everyone – for patients with psychiatric disabilities, and for other patients who have lengthy wait times because ERs are overwhelmed.\\n\\nThey're being asked to do way too much with way too few resources, says Susan Stefan, a lawyer focusing on rights of people with psychiatric disabilities. ERs have a specific mission, which is to provide emergency medical care, and they're being turned into essentially 24-7 social service agencies.\\n\\nStefan, who wrote a book about treating psychiatric patients in ERs, says it's common for them to transfer people to homeless shelters because they are not equipped to find people stable housing.\\n\\nAnd there's another crucial point here: The ER is simply a bad place to treat severe mental illness, even as it is becoming increasingly central for those patients.\\n\\ntoggle caption Emily Bogle/NPR\\n\\nThe emergency department is probably the worst place for somebody in psychiatric crisis, Stefan says. It's loud, it's chaotic and people don't take a lot of time because they don't have a lot of time.\\n\\nAnd it's not straightforward to transform an ER into a place that is appropriate to provide treatment to people who are in the middle of psychiatric crises — although there are hospitals that are experimenting with new models to better serve these patients.\\n\\nThe Alameda Health System in Alameda County, Calif., is a model that both Stefan and Rogers point to. There, a doctor named Scott Zeller has set up a dedicated psychiatric emergency service — a department separate from the standard emergency room that can provide specialized evaluation and treatment for these patients.\\n\\nThe Alameda model reduced boarding times by 80 percent, according to a study published in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine, and the fast, stabilizing treatment made it far less likely that the patient would need to be transferred to an inpatient bed.\\n\\nIf there were adequate services in place, most of the people coming to ERs for psychiatric crises wouldn't need to come there at all, says Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\\n\\nAnd much as everybody loves to talk about the need for mental health services, that doesn't translate into state policy and funding for community mental health services, she says.\\n\\nThe problem here, Mathis says, is political will. There's a big gap between politicians talking about mental health and actually making sure people are getting the services they need."}
{"original": "FACT CHECK: Where Trump's 2019 State Of The Union Promises Stand\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nThe State of the Union this year may make for a seriously awkward moment.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be seated over President Trump's left shoulder Tuesday, less than two months after the Democratic-controlled House impeached him — and just as the Republican-controlled Senate will be deciding whether to keep or remove him from office. (Trump is widely expected to be acquitted because a two-thirds majority is needed to remove a president, and there is no indication that 20 Republicans would side with the Democrats and independents who caucus with them.)\\n\\nBut what of the substance? What about the policies Trump promised in last year's State of the Union address?\\n\\nTrump said in last year's address that he campaigned on core promises on trade, infrastructure, health care, prescription drug pricing, immigration and an America First foreign policy. Related to those core promises, he pledged to do or asked Congress to do more than a dozen specific things in 2019. There has been movement on more than half of his goals in the past year, and roughly a third of the specific promises listed below were accomplished.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\\n\\nWith the help of several policy reporters and editors at NPR, here's a progress report on the president's 2019 State of the Union promises.\\n\\n1. Pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nI hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: 'Made in the USA.' \\n\\nWhere it stands — accomplished\\n\\nThe House and Senate approved the agreement with large, bipartisan majorities and Trump signed the authorizing legislation at the end of January. While Mexico has approved the deal, it still needs final approval from Canada. The USMCA requires automakers to include more North American content in their cars and trucks to qualify for duty-free status, and a minimum wage provision that could result in some auto production shifting from Mexico to the U.S. It also gives U.S. dairy farmers slightly more access to the Canadian market. House Democrats and the AFL-CIO say they pushed the administration to include stronger labor and environmental protections.\\n\\nOn the whole, the USMCA is not expected to have a large effect on the economy, compared to the North American Free Trade Agreement that it replaces. It does avoid the fallout that would have come from scrapping NAFTA without a replacement, as the president had threatened. — Scott Horsley, chief economics correspondent\\n\\n2. Launch program for women in developing countries\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\n[T]his Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\\n\\nWhere it stands — accomplished\\n\\nThe administration launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative three days after the State of the Union speech, led by Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump. It aims to get all U.S. foreign agencies to give top priority to economic development for women and provides grants for projects that help women in developing countries find jobs and start their own businesses. — Roberta Rampton, White House editor\\n\\n3. Boost funding to help eliminate HIV within 10 years\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nMy budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\\n\\nWhere it stands — accomplished\\n\\nThe spending bill that passed right before the holidays fully funded the first year of the president's plan to end the HIV epidemic by 2030 – about $291 million. Not a whole lot has happened related to that plan yet, since the funding only came through weeks ago, but the administration did notch a few wins related to its goal.\\n\\nFirst, it worked out an agreement with Gilead Sciences — the drugmaker that has a monopoly on medication that can prevent HIV infection — to donate drugs for uninsured people at high risk for HIV infection (while also suing Gilead over patent infringement related to that very drug).\\n\\nSecond, the Department of Health and Human Services gave grants to the hot spots around the country where most new infections happen so that those places could begin to create locally customized plans for ending the epidemic. Now that the first year of funding has come through, the hope is that those places can hit the ground running. — Selena Simmons-Duffin, health policy reporter\\n\\n4. Meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nChairman Kim and I will meet again on Feb. 27th and 28th in Vietnam.\\n\\nWhere it stands — accomplished\\n\\nTrump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did have a second nuclear summit at the end of February in Vietnam, but talks ended a day early without a denuclearization deal. Trump cited continued sanctions against North Korea as a sticking point.\\n\\nSometimes, you have to walk, he said, and this was just one of those times.\\n\\nFour months later, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in North Korea before announcing the two countries would revive nuclear talks. Those talks haven't really gotten off the ground. — Ayesha Rascoe, White House reporter\\n\\n5. Boost funding for childhood cancer research\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.\\n\\nWhere it stands — accomplished\\n\\nThe budget for the National Institutes for Health, or NIH, did include an additional $50 million for pediatric cancer, one-tenth of the proposed $500 million over a decade. That's an increase in funding for pediatric cancer of about 9%. The NIH budget is $39 billion, however, so $50 million represents about one-tenth of 1% of the overall budget. — Richard Harris, Science Desk correspondent\\n\\n6. Get nominees confirmed by Senate\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nThis new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nThe record number of judicial nominees confirmed during the Trump administration will be a lasting part of his legacy, with judges confirmed at a prolific pace. In 2019, the Senate changed its debate rules, effectively speeding up the confirmation process for some lower-level judicial and agency nominees.\\n\\nHowever, Trump has also had a record number of people in high-ranking positions at various government agencies who are there in an acting capacity. There's been high turnover and delays in nominations. Currently, 515 of the 741 key positions have been confirmed, with 170 positions lacking an actual nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. — Tamara Keith, White House correspondent\\n\\n7. Boost funding for border wall, other border security\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nCongress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border and My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nNine days after the State of the Union speech, Congress approved a bipartisan spending bill that gave Trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, short of the $5.7 billion he had asked for. Trump signed the bill to avoid a partial government shutdown but moved to declare a national emergency in order to free up military construction funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court allowed the administration to use military funds to build sections of the border wall. Trump's 2020 budget proposal called for $8.6 billion in new border wall funding. Congress rejected that proposal. —Roberta Rampton\\n\\n8. Require disclosure of health care prices\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nWe should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nThe Trump administration is very much in favor of showing prices to lower prices. In June, the president signed an executive order on price transparency. In July, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule for hospitals that would require them to reveal their negotiated prices to consumers in an accessible way. And in November, the department issued a similar proposed rule for insurers.\\n\\nHospitals have already sued to block the first rule, and the rule for insurers has not been finalized, so no secret prices have yet been revealed to help patients shop around. Another rule to require drug makers to display list prices in TV ads was also blocked by a federal judge and is currently on appeal. — Selena Simmons-Duffin\\n\\n9. Pass school choice bill\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\n[T]he time has come to pass School Choice for Americans' children.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nNearly three weeks after the State of the Union speech, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, announced a proposed tax credit that would go toward donations to private school scholarships, along with other school choice measures.\\n\\nHowever, it's a virtual nonstarter in the Democratic-controlled House. Starting in 2019, families can withdraw up to $10,000 from 529 plans (essentially educational IRAs) to pay for private elementary and high schools, a version of school choice. That's due to an overhaul of the tax law in 2017 by the Trump administration. — Elissa Nadworny, reporter and editor for NPREd; and Anya Kamenetz, education correspondent\\n\\n10. Include paid family leave in budget\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nI am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nTrump signed a defense bill that included a provision that granted 12 weeks of paid parental leave to federal employees. Although this doesn't do anything for private-sector employees, the president's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump said she sees this as a big first step. — Tamara Keith\\n\\n11. Pass legislation that limits abortion\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nI am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.\\n\\nWhere it stands — in progress\\n\\nWhile legislation in Congress hasn't gotten very far, measures on the state level have drawn national attention, including an Alabama bill signed in May that bans nearly all abortions. It's considered to be the most restrictive abortion law in the country. Other states, like Georgia and Mississippi, have passed laws that prohibit abortion once heartbeat activity can be detected. — Debbie Elliott, national correspondent covering the South\\n\\n12. Send astronauts to space on American rockets\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nThis year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\\n\\nWhere it stands — no action\\n\\nThe U.S. has not launched people on a spacecraft of its own since the space shuttle retired in 2011. NASA astronauts have been traveling to the station in Russian capsules. Two American companies, Boeing and Space X, have spent years building private space taxis that can take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.\\n\\nWhile there was a possibility of astronauts taking off from U.S. soil in 2019, delays and technical setbacks kept both companies' spacecraft — Boeing's Starliner and Space X's Crew Dragon — from launching with a crew on board. However, it is possible astronauts may finally go up on an American space vehicle in 2020. — Gisele Grayson, Science Desk deputy editor\\n\\n13. Pass bill to boost use of retaliatory tariffs\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nTonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.\\n\\nWhere it stands — no action\\n\\nThen-Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin sponsored HR 764 (United States Reciprocal Trade Act) two weeks prior to the president's address to Congress. It was referred to a subcommittee on trade in March, and no progress has been made since. — Scott Horsley\\n\\n14. Rebuild infrastructure package\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nBoth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\nWhere it stands — no action\\n\\nWhile there have been some infrastructure-related bills introduced in Congress, there haven't been any significant infrastructure developments since Trump's last State of the Union. — Kelsey Snell, congressional correspondent\\n\\n15. Lower prescription drug prices\\n\\nWhat Trump said:\\n\\nI am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.\\n\\nWhere it stands — no action\\n\\nNo significant legislation to lower drug prices got all the way through Congress in 2019. On the House side, Democrats passed a landmark bill on drug prices in December, but it is unlikely to pass a Republican-controlled Senate. A bipartisan effort on the Senate side, which has the support of the White House, has not won over Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, so its prospects for passage this year are not great.\\n\\nTrump does talk a lot about how drug prices have gone down during his presidency, citing the consumer price index, though many fact-checkers have pointed out that it is an imperfect measure and that drug spending overall has continued to climb. — Selena Simmons-Duffin"}
{"original": "Denying Housing Over Criminal Record May Be Discrimination, Feds Say\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is making it easier for people with criminal records to find housing.\\n\\nIn new guidance, released Monday, HUD tells landlords and home sellers that turning down tenants or buyers based on their criminal records may violate the Fair Housing Act.\\n\\nBecause of widespread racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system, criminal history-based restrictions on access to housing are likely disproportionately to burden African-Americans and Hispanics.\\n\\nPeople with criminal records aren't a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, and the guidance from HUD's general counsel says that in some cases, turning down an individual tenant because of his or her record can be legally justified.\\n\\nBut blanket policies of refusing to rent to anybody with a criminal record are de facto discrimination, the department says — because of the systemic disparities of the American criminal justice system.\\n\\nWhen A Criminal Past Closes Doors\\n\\nOne in four Americans has a criminal record, as NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported. Those records can include arrests that never led to convictions, as well as convictions for a wide range of crimes — from petty to serious — that may have happened decades ago.\\n\\nA record can make it hard to find a job — or a home. Many private landlords and public housing projects have policies against renting to people with criminal records.\\n\\nTake Melvin Lofton, who spoke with NPR's Cheryl Corley. Lofton was convicted of burglary and theft when he was in his 20s; now he's 51.\\n\\nHe lives with his mom, and says it would be hard to find housing without that family connection. He remembers one time when he tried to rent a home in a trailer park.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cheryl Corley/NPR Cheryl Corley/NPR\\n\\nI was at work and the guy called me and told me to come pick up my keys. So I was happy. I got a place to stay, Lofton says. So then ... 45 to 50 minutes later he calls and says, 'Is there something you're not telling me?' and I say, 'No, what is there?' And he says, 'You didn't tell me you had a background.' \\n\\nLofton had been out of prison for 20 years at the time, Cheryl reports.\\n\\nSeemingly Neutral Policies Can Be Discriminatory\\n\\nHUD's new guidance warns that landlords could be breaking the law when they refuse to rent to people with criminal records — even if they have no intention to discriminate — because such a policy would likely have a disproportionate impact on African-American and Hispanic applicants.\\n\\nHousing Secretary Julian Castro puts it another way, NPR's Corley reports: When landlords refuse to rent to anyone who has an arrest record, they effectively bar the door to millions of folks of color for no good reason.\\n\\ntoggle caption Camila Domonoske/NPR\\n\\nHUD notes that whether an individual landlord's policy has a discriminatory impact will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis. But on a national level, HUD provided a list of statistics — direct from the Justice Department — demonstrating disproportionately high rates of arrest and incarceration based on race. They noted African-American men are imprisoned at a rate nearly six times that of white men, and Hispanic men at more than twice the rate of white men.\\n\\nAll Criminal Records Aren't Created Alike ...\\n\\nThat doesn't mean landlords are completely barred from considering criminal records — but they'd have to prove that their policy legitimately serves to protect safety or property.\\n\\nSaying criminals are poor tenants doesn't cut it, HUD says: Bald assertions based on generalization or stereotype aren't sufficient.\\n\\nBarring people based just on arrest records is no good, HUD says, because arrests alone aren't proof of guilt. And even if you only consider convictions, refusing to rent to all ex-cons — no matter when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then, HUD writes — also isn't defensible, since not all ex-cons will pose a risk to safety or property.\\n\\nInstead, HUD writes, landlords should have a policy that takes into consideration what the crime was and when it happened, as well as other factors, to reduce the discriminatory impact. (The only exception is if a conviction was for manufacturing or distributing drugs.)\\n\\n... And You Can't Use Records As A Pretext For Discrimination\\n\\nHUD also warns landlords that if they do intend to discriminate, and use criminal records as a cover for their actions, they can be found in violation.\\n\\nFor instance, landlords who reject black or Hispanic applicants ostensibly because of criminal records — but accept a white tenant with a similar criminal record — could be found guilty of violating the Fair Housing Act.\\n\\nRelated Story From Jan. 10 on All Things Considered Around the Nation Pilot Programs Help Former Convicts Find Housing Pilot Programs Help Former Convicts Find Housing Listen · 3:22 3:22\\n\\nThat discrimination could happen even before a candidate applies, HUD writes:\\n\\nIntentional discrimination may be proven based on evidence that, when responding to inquiries from prospective applicants, a property manager told a African-American individual that her criminal record would disqualify her from renting an apartment, but did not similarly discourage a White individual with a comparable criminal record from applying.\\n\\nIn both cases — whether the discrimination is accidental or intentional — each instance would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nBut arbitrary and overbroad policies, as well as any that are mere pretexts to conceal discrimination, aren't protected.\\n\\nHUD officials told NPR's Corley that the goal is to make landlords consider: Is their policy toward criminal records about keeping a community safe?\\n\\nOr is it about keeping somebody out of a home?"}
{"original": "Coyote In The Crosshairs\\n\\nDuring coyote hunting derbies, contestants vie to kill more coyotes than their competitors. Wildlife activists believe the competitions are unethical, and are pushing to make them a thing of the past.\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nWe're going to spend some time now talking about two world championships. Now, you've probably heard about the World Cup. It starts this week. And if you haven't, we'll tell you more about it in just a few minutes. But we're guessing you probably haven't heard about the World Championship Coyote Calling Contest. It is a hunting competition. The goal is to kill as many coyotes as possible, and as you can imagine, it's controversial. NPR's Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi went to Spanish Fork, Utah, for the competition, and he filed this report.\\n\\nALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, BYLINE: This winter, more than 120 hunters gathered for the annual world championship. And from the get-go, it's clear that the organizers are on edge. Here's how they introduce me to the room full of hunters.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: If you're uncomfortable with any question he has, don't answer. He's here on a good-faith basis. If he turns us around and makes us all look bad, then we'll just simply go to his office and beat the [expletive] out of him.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We are a formidable bunch, right?\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: OK, maybe not the warmest welcome. But luckily, my guide to the competition is one of Coyote hunting's greatest evangelists, a guy named Big Al Morris.\\n\\nAL MORRIS: When they throw dirt on me, all they're going to say is I was a hell of a coyote hunter, you know? (Laughter) And he killed a few elk along the way, too.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Morris is a tall, gregarious guy in his early 50s, describes himself as just a biscuit shy of 300 pounds. He cohosts a TV show called Furtakers, and he's won the World Coyote Calling Championship a record four times.\\n\\nMORRIS: None of these guys are here for second place. Everybody wants the title.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Morris's obsession with coyotes goes all the way back to when he was 17. He was playing around with a friend's hand call, a small instrument used by hunters to lure in elk and other game. But when Morris heard rustling from the trees ahead of him, instead of an elk, he found himself staring down a pack of juvenile coyotes.\\n\\nMORRIS: They were going to take down whatever it was making that noise. They were going to eat it.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Morris says that, at first, he was terrified. But after the pack ran off, he says he'd found his calling.\\n\\nMORRIS: That's why I'm on this earth. With this little tiny call that I put in my mouth, I can manipulate a wild animal. I realized I had a gift.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Morris has turned that gift into a livelihood. The week before the competition, Morris and his partner drove over 3,000 miles around the West, mapping out where coyotes live. Contestants will have a day and a half to hunt as many coyotes as possible. I tag along for a practice hunt. We head out to a vast brush-filled valley in southern Utah. The rancher who owns the land is happy to let Morris hunt predators that might attack his calves. Morris carries a bolt-action rifle, a shotgun and an electronic collar, a field stereo packed with dozens of pre-recorded prey sounds to lure coyotes into shooting range. He sets up his rifle on a small bluff overlooking the valley and presses play on his collar.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ELECTRONIC COLLAR CALL)\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: The trick, he says, is to find coyotes that haven't been lured this way before. That can be difficult in Utah, where the government pays hunters a year-round $50 bounty for every coyote killed, part of an effort to boost local deer populations. A few hours later, we begin our drive out of the valley empty-handed. Then, Morris sees a tiny shadow loping through a field of tall grass.\\n\\nMORRIS: There is a coyote. See him? That's a $50 bill right there.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: He pulls over and grabs his rifle.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLING, GUNSHOT)\\n\\nMORRIS: Oh, I hit way low.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)\\n\\nMORRIS: Oh, that was close.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: But the coyote disappears into the brush.\\n\\nMORRIS: We don't get them all.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: On November 30, Morris and his partner, Garvin Young, head out on the 48-hour hunt. The hunt is limited to teams of two, so I wave goodbye for now.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF COYOTES HOWLING)\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: So how did canis latrans, the American coyote, find itself so squarely in the crosshairs?\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF COYOTES HOWLING)\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Well, for thousands of years, the howl of coyotes could only be heard in their original habitat, the American Southwest, where they were held in check by wolves and other predators and viewed by many of their Native American neighbors as a deity. That changed with the arrival of European-American settlers in the early 1800s. Coyotes and wolves took the opportunity to expand their diet to livestock. And for decades, the federal government actively encouraged the extermination of predators. That policy pushed wolves to the brink of extinction, but the wily coyote managed to thrive and spread pretty much everywhere. To this day, the government hires hunters to manage coyote populations and protect livestock in many states. And around 70 years ago, ranchers started to host coyote-hunting competitions.\\n\\nCAMILLA FOX: My grandfather's generation said we need to get rid of the predator, whether we poison it on a ranch or whether we go out and kill it as part of a killing contest. That's the kind of mentality and culture that we're up against.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Camilla Fox is the director of Project Coyote, which wants to shut down coyote-killing competitions. Fox says that coyotes play an important ecological role, but more than that, she thinks it's time for humans to rethink our relationship with the natural world.\\n\\nFOX: We are beyond killing animals for prizes and fun. This should be part of our history books.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: The organization and its partners have used lawsuits to successfully shut down coyote-hunting contests in several states. In 2014, California became the first state to ban them outright, followed by Vermont last month. Some hunters also oppose these competitions. They see them as unsporting and worry they give hunting a bad name. But let's just say the fact that Fox is a vegetarian who lives in California and many of the competition hunters come from deep-red states is probably not a coincidence. There's a cultural divide here, and the way both sides describe each other can get heated.\\n\\nFOX: It's gratuitous slaughter, and that's precisely what cockfighting and dogfighting were. And it was up until not too long ago that both those practices were still legal in the U.S.\\n\\nMORRIS: They don't want me to hunt. And I want to tell them to go to hell. The reality of it is we're good people. And whether you understand or not, I'm doing something legal. And I really don't care if you like it or not.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Big Al Morris is back from the hunt. He and his partner spill out of their truck cab dressed head-to-toe in camo and face paint.\\n\\nMORRIS: Bada-bing-bada-bang (ph), A-Team.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: They've driven over a thousand miles in two days and returned with 14 coyote carcasses.\\n\\nMORRIS: Two hours of sleep sucks.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Inside a corral, each team presents their haul. Some have over two dozen dead coyotes - glazed eyes, frozen in rigor mortis. Staff members use a rectal thermometer to check the body temperature of each coyote.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Fifty-two point seven.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: Then it's off to the weigh station.\\n\\nMORRIS: This one feels like it has a lot of lead in it.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: On the other side of the hangar, employees of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources use shears to snip ear samples from each coyote caught in the state, data for their deer conservation program. Then they're stacked onto a flatbed truck to await being processed for their pelts. As the pile grows to more than 200 coyotes, the hangar fills with the chatter of hunting stories and the acrid smell of entrails. Watching this, there there's no doubt that humans are the ultimate predator. In the end, Big Al Morris is awarded third place. The winners walk away with new rifles and $1,600 of prize money. After the competition, I ask Big Al Morris how he squares the love and respect he's expressed for the coyote with his annual quest to kill as many of them as possible.\\n\\nMORRIS: I don't know how to equate that. I don't know how somebody who doesn't know me would understand that killing them is an expression of my love. I think the coyote's here for us to utilize. God put them here for us. I love them. I don't want to eradicate them. But I'm damn sure going to kill a bunch every year.\\n\\nHOROWITZ-GHAZI: For Morris, there isn't a contradiction between appreciating animals and killing them. It's just part of the natural order. Activists like Project Coyote's Camilla Fox argue that it's time for humans to choose coexistence with other species over domination. And lawmakers are going to have to decide where they stand on the broad spectrum between these two positions as activists continue to push legislation to ban coyote-hunting contests around the country.

{"original": "Twitter Permanently Suspends Trump, Citing 'Risk Of Further Incitement Of Violence'\\n\\nUpdated 10:05 p.m. ET Friday\\n\\nTwitter has permanently suspended President Trump's account over a pattern of behavior that violated company rules.\\n\\nThe action was the most sweeping punishment any major social media company has ever taken against Trump, who has used his Twitter account to announce White House policy, attack rivals and widely disseminate misinformation.\\n\\nFor years, Twitter has been under pressure from critics to limit the reach of Trump's falsehood-laced tweets. Calls for Trump to be banned from Twitter have also been long mounting.\\n\\nYet officials at Twitter stood by his account, since the platform generally gives wide berth to accounts from world leaders whose posts have public value.\\n\\nThat all changed following the violent riots that overtook the Capitol earlier this week after a deluge of posts attempting to sabotage the result of the presidential election.\\n\\nNow, @realDonaldTrump is gone for good and attempts to evade the ban will result in enforcement, Twitter officials said.\\n\\nAfter close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence, the company said in a statement.\\n\\nTrump says Twitter silenced him and his supporters\\n\\nIt did not take long for Trump to try to get around the ban. Trump tweeted four messages from the @POTUS account. All were swiftly taken down.\\n\\nIn the posts, which Trump also shared in a written statement, he accused Twitter of banning free speech.\\n\\nHe said Twitter silenced him and the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me.\\n\\nHe also echoed complaints about a legal shield, known as Section 230, that has long protected tech companies from lawsuits over what is posted on its sites.\\n\\nTwitter may be a private company, but without the government's gift of Section 230 they would not exist for long, the president wrote.\\n\\nFar smaller social media sites, like Gab and Parler, market themselves as having more of an anything-goes culture. The platforms have become especially popular among Trump supporters and other conservatives.\\n\\nIn his statement, Trump said his social media presence will be moving to a yet undisclosed platform.\\n\\nWe have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED! Trump said.\\n\\nLate Friday, Twitter also suspended @TeamTrump, an account associated with the Trump campaign, after it shared a portion of Trump's statement condemning the company's action.\\n\\nTrump called Twitter his 'rocket ship'\\n\\nTrump's Twitter account, which had more than 88 million followers, was removed following the company's warning the president it would happen if he did not stop abusing the platform, including his attempts to sabotage the results of the November election by peddling false claims.\\n\\nThe move is a stunning fall from grace for Trump, who assembled a massive national following, in large part through the prolific use of his Twitter feed. The platform was his preferred tool for announcing major changes in federal policy — and even changes in personnel. He occasionally fired Cabinet secretaries and aides via tweet.\\n\\nHe took pride in his ability to get around the mainstream media and drive cable news with tweets he compared to a rocket ship.\\n\\nI call Twitter a typewriter, Trump told a White House summit with right-wing social media provocateurs in 2019.\\n\\nI go, 'Watch this.' Boom. I press it, and within two seconds, 'We have breaking news,'  he said.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nBut Trump used his Twitter account to do more: routinely disparage, attack and threaten his rivals. Researchers say Trump's tweets supercharged falsehoods about racial justice protesters, the coronavirus and the election, among many other topics.\\n\\nInspired and encouraged by the president's rhetoric — on and off social media — thousands of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. That marked a turning point for Twitter, but it initially stopped short of permanently banning the president and instead limited his access for several hours.\\n\\nTrump's allies took to Twitter to express their fury at the company's decision. Some complained that the company allowed leaders of repressive countries to tweet.\\n\\nJason Miller, who was a top adviser to Trump during his campaign, called the ban disgusting and said Big Tech wanted to cancel the 75 million people who voted for Trump.\\n\\nIf you don't think they're coming for you next, you're wrong, Miller said on Twitter.\\n\\nGrowing Trump fallout on social media\\n\\nTwitter's decision on Friday comes after Facebook and Instagram banned Trump for at least two weeks. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said permitting the president to continue to use the platform during the presidential transition posed a risk that was simply too great.\\n\\nResearchers who study the spread of conspiracies online have said the mayhem that unfolded on the Capitol may have been avoided had the major social media platforms done more to suppress baseless claims about election fraud.\\n\\nFor months, the platforms have been warned about the potential real-world dangers, such as political violence, that could occur when falsehoods about an election are amplified on social media, said Ryan Calo, a cyber law professor at the University of Washington.\\n\\nI am disappointed, Calo said during a briefing with the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of misinformation experts. At how much of a pass the platforms are getting based on saying that they didn't realize that this was a possibility. I think they specifically knew. And I am amazed that it's taken a literal insurrection to even pause this demagoguery on their platforms.\\n\\nTrump still has access to official White House accounts while in office, such as @POTUS and @WhiteHouse — but his access to those accounts end on Jan. 20, the first day of Joe Biden's presidency.\\n\\nA Twitter official said @POTUS and @WhiteHouse will not be suspended, but the company will take action to limit their use ahead of the accounts transitioning to the Biden administration. The company's policy is to suspend any accounts that are used to get around a ban such as the one imposed on the president Friday.\\n\\nThe final tweet from @realDonaldTrump, sent Friday, read, To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\\n\\nSome Trump supporters understood that message as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate, Twitter said in its statement. It could also be interpreted as a disavowal of pledges by Trump's staff to have an orderly transition on Inauguration Day, the company added.\\n\\nEditor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters."}
{"original": "Opinion: Iran Is Escalating Its Nuclear Program. Biden Should Not Rush To Respond\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\\n\\nHenry Rome (@hrome2) is senior analyst for Iran, Israel, and global macro issues at Eurasia Group, the global political risk research and consulting firm.\\n\\nIran appears intent on generating a nuclear crisis early in Joe Biden's presidency. On Monday, the Iranian government said it began enriching uranium to the 20% level, which is close to the purity used in a nuclear weapon. It is preparing further steps in the coming months, according to a timeline passed by parliament. Iran aims to compel Biden to immediately and unconditionally remove the sanctions that President Trump began to impose three years ago after he pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei repeated this demand on Friday, calling on the U.S. to lift sanctions on Iran immediately.\\n\\nBiden should not play into Iran's pattern of nuclear threats combined with artificial deadlines. Biden and his team will have time — and economic leverage — on their side. The incoming administration should take advantage of its strong position to diligently pursue its goal of strengthening and lengthening nuclear restrictions and should resist the pressure to act hastily.\\n\\nBiden will inherit significant economic leverage over Iran. However misguided and erratic Trump's approach was toward Iran, the president renewed and strengthened the U.S.'s most comprehensive sanctions regime. Trump failed to convert this leverage into diplomatic progress because he did not have a clear strategy or a realistic path to achieving it. While Trump repeatedly urged Iran to negotiate and Make the Big Deal, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's demands for Iran amounted to a call for regime change. Trump also hired John Bolton, an outspoken supporter of regime change, to serve as national security adviser. Tehran had little incentive to talk, let alone offer concessions, to an administration that ultimately sought its surrender or demise.\\n\\nBiden will flip this logic. The president-elect has outlined concrete diplomatic objectives concerning Iran — including reaffirming the importance of the 2015 nuclear agreement. The nuclear deal, signed by Iran and six world powers, imposed limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. Biden and his team, which played key roles in securing that agreement when he was vice president, have proved they can negotiate in good faith and keep their word. By taking a more realistic approach, Biden can unlock the power of the leverage Trump accumulated.\\n\\nU.S. economic might should not be underestimated. Combined with Iran's endemic corruption and the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. sanctions have cratered the Iranian economy, driven up inflation and eroded the purchasing power of average Iranians. The U.S. measures have effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and targeted key sectors, including energy and manufacturing. Oil exports, Iran's most important source of hard currency, remain largely crippled by the threat of U.S. sanctions. The government has tried to boost the non-oil sector and focus on trade in goods that are not as easy for sanctions to interrupt. But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's latest budget proposal continues to rely significantly on oil. Budgeting has a habit of focusing minds, and the message from Rouhani's plan could not have been clearer: The long-term stability of the economy depends in large part on relations with Washington.\\n\\nTehran will try to prevent Biden from taking advantage of this leverage by creating an atmosphere of imminence and crisis. Even as Tehran reacted to the siege at the U.S. Capitol this week, President Rouhani repeated his call on Biden to lift sanctions, saying, If you won't fulfill your commitments, we won't bow to you. Tehran's efforts can be divided into three categories.\\n\\nFirst, the Iranian president and his aides are urging Biden to move quickly, before Iran's June presidential elections. Rouhani, a relative moderate, is serving his final term. A more conservative leader will likely prevail in the election, potentially creating a window of opportunity to deal with Rouhani on his way out the door. But, as analyst Ariane Tabatabai and I have argued, the impending election will not fundamentally alter Tehran's strategic outlook or its openness to negotiations. Rouhani's successor will not necessarily be more hostile to diplomacy even if he is more anti-American. Washington should not expect that its policies can dictate the outcome of the Iranian election, and it should not allow the election to dictate its own policies.\\n\\nSecond, Tehran is trying to create a ticking clock with its nuclear program. The parliament passed legislation that sets up a series of dates when Iran is to take new nuclear steps. The most provocative next step, a significant reduction in international inspector access, is slated for late February. But these deadlines are purely artificial. Iran's nuclear policy is ultimately under the control of Khamenei, not the rambunctious, hawkish parliament or the lame-duck president. Deadlines can and will be fudged depending on the overall political environment.\\n\\nThird, Tehran continues to bolster its forces and lash out in the region, a not-so-subtle reminder to Biden about its capability to cause trouble. Washington noted with increasing concern last week that Iranian-backed forces were planning to attack U.S. soldiers based in Iraq to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. (Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded with the bizarre suggestion that Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans in Iraq.)\\n\\nOn Monday, armed Iranian forces boarded a South Korean tanker and are apparently holding it hostage until Seoul facilitates the release of some $7 billion of Iranian assets frozen in Korean banks. The following day, Iran launched significant exercises with military drones.\\n\\nBut these shows of force may end up being self-defeating, as they turn more countries against Tehran. For example, increased Iranian provocations may push Gulf Arab states closer to Israel, strengthening the agreements normalizing relations between these countries and Israel that were brokered by the Trump administration last year.\\n\\nEven if Iran does escalate its nuclear program or its provocative regional activity, Biden has tools to deflect the pressure. He plans to strengthen relations with key U.S. allies, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which are party to the nuclear agreement. Under Trump, European states spent as much time condemning Washington as they did Tehran. With unity between the U.S. and Europe, new Iranian provocations will only further isolate Tehran. The three European states on Wednesday issued a sharp condemnation of Iran's latest nuclear steps, a sign of future U.S.-European unity. Russia and China, the other signatories to the agreement, will also oppose Iranian efforts to significantly expand its nuclear program. Israel will remain laser-focused on Iran and probably will set clear red lines to box in Iranian activity.\\n\\nHow Biden decides to proceed with Iran will depend in part on his other priorities, as well as the views of U.S. allies. During the presidential campaign and transition, Biden and his aides indicated a desire to bolster the verification provisions of the nuclear deal and extend the duration of its physical restrictions. They have also expressed an intention to conduct broader, regional negotiations. All of these steps will require painstaking multilateral diplomacy. Ultimately, Biden should not feel rushed for these critical negotiations — and he should leverage his sanctions inheritance to advance these objectives."}

Essentially, it's an act of war.\\n\\nThe State Department on Friday urged U.S. citizens to immediately leave Iraq, where officials say the embassy in Baghdad was attacked by Iran-backed militia members earlier in the week.\\n\\nThe strike on Soleimani comes a week after a rocket attack in northern Iraq killed a U.S. contractor. American officials said an Iranian-backed militia was responsible. The Trump administration also tied Soleimani to recent violent protests.\\n\\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the killing an act of international terrorism, saying the U.S. bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.\\n\\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement on Iranian state TV that a harsh retaliation is waiting for the U.S.\\n\\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani was just as forceful, describing the strike as a heinous crime for which Iran will seek revenge.\\n\\nSo the biggest question now is how does Tehran respond? wrote Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East security expert who worked on Iran issues in the Obama administration.\\n\\nTargeting an American diplomatic facility or senior leader with a terrorist attack elsewhere in the world may feel proportional for the Iranians but this is very hard to pull off. Outside of the Mideast their capabilities are much more limited, Goldenberg tweeted.\\n\\nTrump, who is vacationing on his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., tweeted a photo of an American flag with no other message. Trump had earlier vowed that Iran would pay a very big price for the unrest at the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad.\\n\\nRepublicans celebrated the killing of Soleimani, saying America is safer after the violent leader was brought to justice. But Democrats slammed the White House for not consulting Congress before the strike and worried the attack would lead to an almost inevitable escalation.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement the strike was disproportionate, arguing that it risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. America — and the world — cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.\\n\\nThe chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., released a statement saying he is worried about the security aftereffects of the strike, which Engel said had gone ahead without notice or consultation with Congress.\\n\\nTo push ahead with an action of this gravity without involving Congress raises serious legal problems and is an affront to Congress's powers as a coequal branch of government, Engel said.\\n\\nNaysan Rafati, a senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, underscored just how significant the death of Soleimani is inside Iran, where he is among the country's most revered military leaders.\\n\\nThis is a major blow to the Iranians, symbolically as well as strategically. There has been no individual as deeply associated with Iran's regional network of partners and proxies as Soleimani, which made him a hero to Tehran's allies and a villain without peer to its rivals, Rafati said.\\n\\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi characterized the strike in dire terms, saying it is a dangerous escalation that ignites a devastating war in Iraq, the region and the world.\\n\\nThe strike also killed Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an adviser to Soleimani.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nA reach far beyond Iran\\n\\nSoleimani was one of Iran's most powerful and shadowy figures. As leader of the Quds Force, he was said to be responsible for the country's development and coordination with militias and proxy forces throughout the Middle East. U.S. officials accuse him of coordinating Iraqi militia attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.\\n\\nU.S. officials have accused Soleimani of sponsoring terrorism and singled him out as a major figure for decades. The Trump administration placed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — which includes the Quds Force — on the State Department's list of terrorist groups. It was the first time a government's official military was placed on the list.\\n\\nNorman Roule, now retired, tracked Iran through his career with the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. He told NPR's All Things Considered the death of Soleimani was significant.\\n\\nYou can expect seismic waves to go through the Shia communities of Lebanon, Iraq and Iran, Roule said. You can expect that the Iranians and the Iraqi militia groups will certainly seek some sort of retribution.\\n\\nRoule called Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed, Soleimani's senior-most lieutenant in the Iraqi military architecture.\\n\\nRoule said he believed the U.S. would not have carried out the strikes unless a significant terrorist attack was underway or about to be undertaken by these individuals and if neutralizing these individuals would prevent that.\\n\\nSoleimani's Quds Force is a sort of a mixture of our special operations and Central Intelligence Agency, according to Roule. He [had] been given charge of Iran's foreign policy in the region and in essence he used that authority to create a series of militias based on the Lebanese Hezbollah.\\n\\nAs a military commander he would not actually rank in capacity or stature with a first-world military commander, such as a U.S. general. However, his political reach was vast ... in that Iran basically ceded its regional activities to his purview, Roule said.\\n\\nIn 2018, Soleimani spoke with political authority when he responded to a tweet by President Trump, who said Iran would suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before if it repeated threats against the U.S.\\n\\nSoleimani was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency: As a soldier, it is my duty to respond to your threats, he said. It is not in our president's dignity to respond to you.\\n\\nCome. We are ready, Soleimani said, accusing Trump of using the language of nightclubs and gambling halls.\\n\\nIf you begin the war, we will end the war, he said.\\n\\nNPR's Deborah Amos contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Who Would Enjoy Tax Breaks Under The GOP Health Care Proposals?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert Gauthier/LA Times via Getty Images Robert Gauthier/LA Times via Getty Images\\n\\nThere's a lot of talk on Capitol Hill about the tax cuts included in the Republican health plans, but unless you are a frequent user of tanning beds or have personal wealth that puts you in the top 1 percent, you might not feel much effect.\\n\\nThe House and Senate bills both change or eliminate more than a dozen taxes that were levied to help pay for the Affordable Care Act's insurance subsidies and to bolster Medicare and expand Medicaid. Republicans and other ACA critics have argued that the taxes are onerous for businesses and families.\\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax cuts and coverage changes in the Senate proposal would reduce the federal government's revenue by $700 billion over the next 10 years.\\n\\nWe're answering three key questions about the tax cuts:\\n\\n1. Which taxes are targeted for repeal?\\n\\nMost of them fall into two buckets.\\n\\nBucket 1: Taxes related to individual income\\n\\nThe ACA levied a 0.9 percent increase in the Medicare payroll tax on income above $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for couples.\\n\\nIt also added a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income — as in stocks, bonds, interest and capital gains — that kicks in after $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.\\n\\nAs Senate leaders consider revisions to their bill, some senators — including Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee — have suggested leaving the investment tax in place to provide more money for subsidies, but others have objected to that idea. This would be a major divergence from the House-passed bill.\\n\\nStill, if both of those taxes in the ACA were repealed, high-income Americans would collectively pay about $231 billion less in taxes over 10 years, according to the CBO analysis.\\n\\nBucket 2: Taxes on corporations\\n\\nSince the passage of the ACA, drug companies and medical device manufacturers have complained that the taxes levied on them have a chilling effect on innovation and affect their ability to hire more workers. They also argue that costs are passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.\\n\\nUnder the Senate plan, drug companies would see an estimated $25.7 billion cut over 10 years, while medical device makers would get about $19.6 billion in savings. Some of the cuts would start as early as this calendar year.\\n\\nIn both bills, there's also relief for insurers. The GOP plans would eliminate a tax on all insurers based on their market share. Congress waived the tax this year, hoping the one-time move would help slow premium increases. The CBO analysis of the Senate bill found a permanent cut would save the industry $144.7 billion over the next decade.\\n\\nOther taxes outside the buckets\\n\\nSmaller but not insignificant cuts come from eliminating other taxes, including a limit — $2,600 this year — on how much workers can annually set aside tax-free in flexible spending accounts to pay for things like medications, eyeglasses or co-payments for doctor's office visits. The plans would also increase the amount people could put in tax-protected health savings accounts. The Senate proposal would also revert tax law back to pre-ACA days in setting the threshold for medical deductions at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income; the ACA had boosted that to 10 percent. The House approach is even more generous.\\n\\nAnd not to be forgotten: The GOP plans would delete a 10 percent tax on the use of tanning beds.\\n\\n2. Am I going to get a large tax break from this?\\n\\nThe short answer: Unless you're wealthy, probably not.\\n\\nThe ACA significantly increased average taxes on high-income people mainly through the investment income tax and the Medicare payroll tax. So the top 1 percent and other high earners are the group that would benefit most from the repeal, according to several analyses, including one by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nUnder the GOP proposals, the top 1 percent — those earning $875,000 a year or more in 2026 — would get an average tax cut of about $40,000 per year, while middle-income people earning about $50,000 to $90,000 would see about a $300 cut, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the center.\\n\\nThose earning about $28,000 or less could save an average of $180 a year through the changes to limits on FSA and HSA contributions and the threshold on medical deductions, he says.\\n\\n3. How will the federal government offset the loss of tax revenue, and what will that mean for insurance or other programs?\\n\\nEven though the tax cuts and other changes would reduce Treasury revenue by about $700 billion over the next decade, spending cuts exceed that amount, so the deficit actually goes down by $321 billion, the CBO says.\\n\\nThe biggest spending cuts hit the Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for low-income children and adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid pays for nearly half of all births and much of the cost of nursing home care. Spending on Medicaid by 2026 would shrink by 26 percent compared with what it would be under the ACA.\\n\\nAs to other effects, the number of Americans without health insurance coverage would rise, the CBO says. Because the GOP proposals cut the tax penalty for not having insurance, it estimates that far fewer people would enroll in coverage. That, coupled with smaller subsidies to help lower- and middle-income people buy their own insurance and cuts to Medicaid, could lead to 22 million fewer insured Americans by 2026, the CBO says.\\n\\nStates could choose to try to make up for federal Medicaid spending cuts and maintain current levels of coverage, but that would probably involve raising state taxes, cutting other budget items such as education, or both.\\n\\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation."}
{"original": "DOJ: 'Severely Deficient Training' Has Led To Pattern Of Abuse By Chicago Police\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Justice Department says an investigation has found Chicago police are systematically violating the civil rights of people in the city through excessive use of force, poor oversight and inadequate training of officers.\\n\\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the investigation's findings on Friday, saying the DOJ had concluded there was ample evidence the Chicago Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of the use of excessive force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\\n\\nThe abuse is most prevalent in the predominantly black neighborhoods on Chicago's South and West sides. The report cited numerous examples of unreasonable force, such as kicking a subject who balled his fists and using a Taser against a suspect fleeing the scene of a minor property crime.\\n\\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said the investigation had found that officers shot people who presented no clear threat and tased people who did not follow orders.\\n\\nLynch said the city and the DOJ had agreed to enter negotiations about a court-enforced consent decree to guide reform within the police department. A federal judge also would need to sign off on any final agreement before it would go into effect.\\n\\nThe Justice Department's pattern or practice investigation was launched more than a year ago, after a white police officer shot a black teenager named Laquan McDonald 16 times in October 2014, killing the 17-year-old youth.\\n\\nUnder court order in November 2015, the city released police dashcam video of the killing, prompting protests by activists who said the city had tried to cover up the shooting.\\n\\nThe police officer, Jason Van Dyke, has been charged with murder and is facing trial. The department has moved to fire Van Dyke, as well as four other police officers for allegedly lying about the shooting.\\n\\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel apologized for the killing and the handling of the video. That happened on my watch, Emanuel said in December 2015, and he promised a complete and total reform of the system, as The Two-Way reported.\\n\\nWhile the state court system is handling Van Dyke's individual case, the purpose of the Justice Department review was to investigate how such incidents reflected the larger culture and practices within the entire department.\\n\\nFederal investigators said Friday that they had interviewed hundreds of people and combed through data about use of force and how the police department held those officers who used excessive force accountable.\\n\\nIn September, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon said the investigation had grown into the largest such probe ever undertaken by federal authorities, according to The Chicago Tribune.\\n\\nIt was unclear what immediate effect, if any, Friday's announcement would have on the day-to-day practices of the Chicago Police Department. As the Tribune noted, It will be months before a consent decree would be worked out and filed in federal court.\\n\\nPolice departments have operated under consent decrees in cities ranging from Ferguson, Mo., to Newark, N.J., and just this week, Baltimore announced the details of a consent decree with its police department.\\n\\nUnder President Obama, the Justice Department has increased the number of civil rights investigations into law enforcement practices, as Bloomberg has reported. But President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to become the next U.S attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has indicated he does not support consent decrees.\\n\\nAt a Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, Sessions said DOJ investigations into police departments can undermine respect for police officers. He added, I think there's concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department who have done wrong, and those individuals need to be prosecuted.\\n\\nIn a 2008 policy paper on consent decrees, Sessions described the agreements as one of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power and said that in practice, a decree can last for many years — longer than the remedy that was needed."}
{"original": "Trump's Foreign Policy Reversals\\n\\nIn his first 100 days in office, President Trump has reversed course on major foreign policy issues regarding NATO, Syria and China.\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nThis week, President Trump raised the specter of a military confrontation with North Korea, but of course, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, talked about the need for direct dialogue. There have been flip-flops on matters elsewhere, in Asia and across the globe, Europe, the Middle East. As NPR's Michele Kelemen reports, if you're trying to follow U.S. foreign policy, you might sue for whiplash.\\n\\nMICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Let's start in Asia where Trump once said he would name China as a currency manipulator and even suggested that he might not abide by the One China policy, taking a call from the leader of Taiwan. Then came his meeting in Florida with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had a very good bonding. I think we had a very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea. We talked trade. We talked a lot of things, and I said the way you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Also this month, Trump met with NATO's secretary general, sealing his change in approach to the military alliance.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nTRUMP: I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete. It's my hope that NATO will take on an increased role in supporting our Iraqi partners in their battle against ISIS.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Trump had been talking about a more restrained American role in the world, a so-called America First agenda. His decision to strike Syria in response to a sarin gas attack was another surprising turn-about. White House officials say this is a sign that the Trump doctrine is not doctrinaire. The Cato Institute's John Glaser, a Libertarian, has a different perspective.\\n\\nJOHN GLASER: When he talks about his flexibility, he's harkening back to Richard Nixon's madman theory of international politics, which is that if you can signal to allies and adversaries that maybe you're unpredictable or perhaps even irrational, you can unsettle them and then essentially get your way. But, frankly, that's just an irresponsible way to conduct foreign policy.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Glaser believes Trump is just learning on the job and that he didn't have very firm views on international affairs before coming to Washington. Add to that the foreign policy establishment - now jokingly referred to here in Washington as the Blob - and Glaser says you can understand how hard it is to make radical changes.\\n\\nGLASER: If you have to face the Blob and you don't have firm views, you can pretty much expect that the administration will settle in to a very traditional and conventional American foreign policy.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Some Republicans on Capitol Hill welcome what they view as a more mainstream policy. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland, still has his doubts.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nBEN CARDIN: We still don't have really a coherent foreign policy being announced by the Trump administration. He doesn't have in place the individuals that we would normally be able to call to Capitol Hill to review what they're doing in different parts of the world. Those positions haven't even been nominated yet, let alone confirmed.\\n\\nKELEMEN: At the State Department, there's only Secretary Rex Tillerson. A deputy has been nominated but not yet confirmed. And the other Senate-approved positions are being held temporarily by career foreign service officers. Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil CEO, is reorganizing the department and trimming the budget.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: We're just about to embark on a department-wide listening mission. I know because I've had a few interactions with people over lunch, some of our folks that are kind of at the 10-to-12-year stage of their career where they're young and energetic, but they've been around long enough to see what works and what doesn't. I look forward to hearing their ideas.\\n\\nKELEMEN: In an interview with NPR, Tillerson said his mission is to stay focused on security and economic interests. The list of goals was longer in previous administrations. President Obama, for instance, had diplomats and development experts put a big focus on climate change, while the Bush administration talked a lot about democracy promotion.

{"original": "Israel And The Iran Deal\\n\\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to the former chief of Israeli military intelligence, Amos Yadlin, about how changes in U.S. foreign policy are affecting Israel.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nIsrael is at the center of two major American foreign policy shifts. Last week, the U.S. pulled out of the Iran deal - something Israel has long lobbied for. And in another controversial move, tomorrow, the U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem. With us to analyze these major developments is former chief of Israeli military intelligence General Amos Yadlin. He is now Israel's director of the Institute for National Security Studies. And he joins us from Tel Aviv.\\n\\nThank you so much for being with us.\\n\\nAMOS YADLIN: Good morning.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Good morning. President - excuse me - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spent years warning of the dangers of the Iran deal. And he personally lobbied President Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement. Do you think the U.S. move to withdraw from the deal will ultimately be in Israel's interest?\\n\\nYADLIN: It depends. The deal is not the issue. The issue is how will we stop the Iranian nuclear ambitions, how we stop the Iranian subversion and the attempt to have hegemony in the Middle East. And you haven't mentioned the last week Israeli-Iranian confrontation over Syria, how we change the regime behavior and the regime determination to destroy Israel and how we do all of these very important objectives without going to war. So it's too early to judge. It depends on the Iranian reaction to President Trump move and depends on how Israel and the U.S. will react to the Iranian reaction.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you - you have spent some time here in Washington, talking to officials. And you wrote after those meetings that hope is no alternative for a plan of action, which seems to suggest that you are unclear what the American objectives is. What should happen now?\\n\\nYADLIN: I think the American objective - especially after the president substitute his close team, the secretary of state and the national security adviser - the president wants to change the behavior of the regime or even to change the regime. And the sanctions should serve as a tool, as a leverage whether to bring the Iranians to the negotiation table to a better deal. Or, if the sanctions will be very effective, as I say, it may be a regime change. This is something that previous administration didn't look into. It wasn't the Obama administration policy. So what...\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You're suggesting the Trump administration would like regime change, or they want Iran to be - return to the negotiating table and sign a new agreement.\\n\\nYADLIN: ...I think, in a way, it's a win-win. If the sanctions will bring the Iranians to negotiation with a weaker position, and they can make the deal better, this is one win. Another win - if the regime will collapse due to the sanctions. So what we have to look into first - let's say - six months after the withdrawal - are the American administration able to impose a very painful sanctions on Iran? Or the fact that they went out of the international consensus. Europe and Russia and China are not helping them to have painful sanctions. And then the Iranians can feel that it doesn't matter that America withdraw from the deal.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So it's uncertain what the reaction will be, and we need to look is what you're suggesting. We don't have a lot of time left. And I want to ask you about the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem. What do you see as the repercussions?\\n\\nYADLIN: I supported this move from the very beginning. There were two warnings against the move. One, that there will be a riot and another intifada, and all the American embassies will be burned in the Arab world. Never happened. The gun was empty. Second, says that the peace process will be killed. Unfortunately, the peace process was already dead. And maybe this move will wake it up.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Former chief of Israeli military intelligence Amos Yadlin joining us from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much.\\n\\nYADLIN: Good morning.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

The State Department confirmed the new restriction on Friday, after Young Pioneer Tours, which organized Otto Warmbier's fateful visit to North Korea, announced the pending move.\\n\\nWarmbier's trip to the pariah nation ended in detention, imprisonment and a catastrophic head injury that resulted in his death after being released and deported to the U.S. last month.\\n\\nThe serious risk of further detentions prompted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to authorize a geographical travel restriction on all U.S. citizen nationals' use of a passport to travel in, through, or to North Korea, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\\n\\nThe restriction will become official 30 days after a notice is published in the Federal Register next week, she added.\\n\\nIndividuals seeking to travel to North Korea for certain limited humanitarian or other purposes may apply to the Department of State for a special validation passport, Nauert said.\\n\\nAccording to a statement that Young Pioneer Tours posted to its website, the new policy will include the threat of canceling the passport of any American who violates the ban.\\n\\nAnother travel company that operates in North Korea, Lupine Travel, tells NPR that while it hasn't been contacted directly, all we've heard is that apparently the Swedish Embassy have told a couple of other agencies that the ban is imminent.\\n\\nThe Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang operates as a conduit between the U.S. and North Korea, which do not maintain diplomatic relations.\\n\\nUp to now, the U.S. policy has been that it strongly recommends against all travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea.\\n\\nNews of the ban comes on the heels of North Korea's launching a new website that seeks to promote tourism to the country that has been at odds with much of the international community over its nuclear and missile programs.\\n\\nAs NPR's Colin Dwyer reported, At least 16 Americans have been arrested by North Korean authorities in the past decade, according to the State Department — and that includes 'those who traveled independently and those who were part of organized tours.' \\n\\nDetails of the travel ban that were provided by Young Pioneers match those supplied by Koryo Tours, another group that organizes visits to North Korea.\\n\\nThis news has been expected but nevertheless is something of a shock, Koryo Tours said in a statement, and we're sorry for anyone who had planned a trip or who had hoped to visit and who now will not be permitted to do so.\\n\\nNews of the pending ban comes one month after Warmbier, 22, died shortly after his return to the U.S. from a North Korean prison.\\n\\nThe college student had been sentenced to 15 years in prison and hard labor for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster. He was arrested during a trip that was organized by Young Pioneer Tours, which said in June that it will no longer take Americans to North Korea."}
{"original": "Americans Returning To U.S. Say They're Surprised By Lack Of Stringent Health Checks\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption via DanHonig via DanHonig\\n\\nAmericans returning home from abroad are being greeted with varying levels of health screenings at U.S. airports — with some saying the U.S. measures are less stringent than what they've experienced overseas.\\n\\nI expected that my temperature would probably be taken, as it had been when boarding the flight, says Dan Honig, who arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport on April 3 aboard a State Dept. repatriation flight from Senegal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Passengers on other flights have made similar comments about expecting more extensive health checks upon arrival in the U.S.\\n\\nPassengers on Honig's flight wore face masks and armbands listing their temperatures — and the plane was staffed by medical workers in hazmat suits, he said. But upon arrival at Dulles, the group of some 150 passengers didn't undergo a final health screening; Honig says they were dropped off at the arrivals terminal, where people headed to baggage claim and on to their final destinations including, in some cases, domestic flights.\\n\\nWhen NPR asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection about Honig's experience and seeking clarity about the COVID-19 screening policy for repatriated Americans, a spokesperson said the agency is following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nTravel to the U.S. is now restricted from countries including China, Iran, the U.K. and most of Europe. The CBP representative said via email that the agency's officers look to refer travelers arriving from those countries, or who shows symptoms of COVID-19, for enhanced health screening by the CDC.\\n\\nThe process may vary by location, they said, due to several factors that include whether health screening occurs before travelers reach CBP primary inspection.\\n\\nDulles International Airport has issued guidance for people arriving on international flights, saying travelers coming from China, Iran, the U.K. and the European Union's open-border Schengen Area are taken in groups of 50 to be screened for COVID-19 by staff from the CDC and Department of Homeland Security. The airport does not mention any screenings for travelers arriving from other countries.\\n\\nA request for further comment from Dulles was referred to the CDC. Multiple requests to the CDC for comment since Thursday were not answered before this story was published. The CDC website offers a travel warning and some basic guidance for travelers.\\n\\nThe State Dept. has brought more than 45,000 Americans home on repatriation flights, it said earlier this week. The flights came from a wide range of countries, such as Peru, India, Egypt, Nepal and Burundi, according to Ian Brownlee, who runs the department's repatriation task force. Those countries, like Senegal, have not been among the world's hotspots for COVID-19.\\n\\nThe massive repatriation effort is in response to the Level 4 travel advisory the State Dept. issued last month instructing U.S. citizens not to travel internationally — and for those who are abroad, to either return immediately or be prepared to remain abroad indefinitely.\\n\\nComing home to America during a pandemic was alternately inspiring and puzzling, as Honig decsribed it on Twitter and in an interview with NPR. Honig, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, recounts that crew members were medical professionals.\\n\\nListen up! one yelled, according to Honig. This isn't a normal flight, and we're not flight attendants — we're medical professionals. Our job is to get you home safe.\\n\\nThey had been working for six days straight and had another flight coming up the following day; when someone asked if they were being paid overtime, the medical professional laughed, Honig said.\\n\\nWe're government employees. No. This is our job, Honig quoted the man as saying. This is why I signed up for this job. I'm proud to do this — I'm honored to help y'all get home.\\n\\nEveryone clapped, Honig said.\\n\\nBut upon arriving, one of the only overt acknowledgements of the pandemic, Honig said, came when an immigration officer asked whether he had been to any country other than Senegal in the last 14 days.\\n\\nI didn't know if we would be given self-quarantine orders, he says, but I thought, at the very least, we would be kind of recommended to do so.\\n\\nAfter Honig shared his impressions of flying into the U.S., others came forward to tell similar stories.\\n\\nOne of those people was Hillary Vance, of the University of Arizona.\\n\\nVance and her husband, Phil Butterworth, flew from Cambodia to Los Angeles on a commercial flight last week after learning there wouldn't be a repatriation flight. Their flight transited through Tokyo; a month earlier, the same trip was routed through South Korea.\\n\\n'The only screening I had was at the airport in Seoul (March 4) and in Tokyo (April 2), Vance says.\\n\\nAirports around Southeast Asia (I travel for work) were much more regular about temperature screenings, health questionnaires, and getting contact information from arriving passengers including what seats they sat in and where they were staying, Vance says.\\n\\nThere were no such precautions during either of her arrivals in the U.S., Vance says.\\n\\nAnother traveler, who flew on a commercial flight from Guangzhou, China, to Los Angeles last week, tells NPR that the only screening she faced was having her temperature taken at both ends of the journey — including in the U.S.\\n\\nAnd in reply to Honig's tweets about his flight, economist Jock O'Connell said, We arrived at [San Francisco International] on March 20 from Spain. We did receive a medical check in the jetway before being allowed into the airport. He said the medical check was performed by San Mateo County Health Department officials.\\n\\nHonig, who is on a sabbatical from his university job to write a book about what he calls mission-driven bureaucrats, said he traveled from Senegal to Guinea-Bissau on Feb. 22 — where he was asked to wash my hands with bleach water; my temperature was checked; I was asked questions about my movements and health status.\\n\\nAs for what he expected the process of entering the U.S. to be like, Honig says, I expected at least as much as I experienced entering Guinea-Bissau six weeks earlier."}
{"original": "The Year The U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program Unraveled\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Felipe Dana/AP Felipe Dana/AP\\n\\nLast year began with an angry phone call about refugees, famously leaked later. The newly inaugurated Donald Trump exploded when Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, asked him to honor a U.S. pledge to resettle some 1,200 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centers.\\n\\nThis is a stupid deal, Trump fumed to an astonished Turnbull. This shows me to be a dope.\\n\\nA day earlier, the president had signed an executive order temporarily halting the entire U.S. refugee resettlement program and slashed the number of expected arrivals President Obama had set.\\n\\nTrump complained that by honoring the deal with Australia he was going to get killed politically and abruptly hung up the phone.\\n\\nThe damage has already been done. ... The layoffs are already doing structural damage. It's going to take a long time to rebuild.\\n\\nIt was the harbinger of policies set in motion to unravel the U.S. refugee resettlement program, an issue that defined Trump's election campaign and has shaped much of his first year in office. Attempts to shut down the program, challenged in the courts, have evolved to more calculated bureaucratic challenges that will have long-term consequences, says Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq.\\n\\nThis is strategic, that's why it's different from previous anti-immigrant mindsets. It is a conscious effort to deconstruct the system, Crocker says. He points to dramatic budget cuts for the nine private, voluntary agencies that for decades have contracted with the State Department to resettle and integrate the refugee population in communities across the U.S.\\n\\nThe damage has already been done. These agencies run on the slimmest of margins. The layoffs are already doing structural damage. It's going to take a long time to rebuild, he says.\\n\\nWith Trump's travel ban, plus a scaled back refugee program, 2017 was an assault on immigration by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Quigley, a refugee advocate with Human Rights First, a nongovernmental organization in Washington.\\n\\nThere are multiple avenues by which they are trying to cut off different kinds of legal immigration, she says.\\n\\nIn September, President Trump dramatically lowered the cap for refugee admissions in fiscal year 2018 to 45,000. That's well below the annual refugee arrivals under President Barack Obama and even lower than most years during George W. Bush's presidency.\\n\\nNational The Call-In: The Refugee Experience In The U.S. The Call-In: The Refugee Experience In The U.S. Listen · 10:36 10:36\\n\\nOver the course of Trump's first year in office, he's repeatedly said refugee resettlement must be temporarily limited due to national security concerns. When he unveiled his first National Security Strategy on Dec. 18, he cited chain migration — meaning any immigration to the U.S. based on family ties to a legal immigrant or refugee — as a security threat and called for Congress to reverse America's family reunification policy.\\n\\nBut rights groups say they see a bigger aim, supported by powerful anti-immigrants groups: to vastly restrict refugee resettlement as part of a wider agenda to limit legal immigration.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is trying to dismantle the program piece by piece. It's clear they want a smaller program and not include some populations, says Jen Smyers, the advocacy director of Church World Service, one of the voluntary agencies that resettle refugees and now face severe budget cuts and office closures.\\n\\nTrump's reductions to the refugee program reportedly put him at odds with the National Security Council, the State Department and the Department of Defense. But it's not considered low enough for conservative anti-refugee groups that wanted the cap set at zero.\\n\\nDonald Trump missed a fabulous opportunity to suspend the entire refugee admissions program, activist Ann Corcoran complained to Breitbart News. Corcoran runs the Refugee Resettlement Watch website that regularly claims the resettlement program is corrupt and a health and security risk for communities that accept the newcomers.\\n\\nEd Martin, president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a conservative interest group in St. Louis, gives Trump higher marks.\\n\\nThe conversation is going in the right direction, he says.\\n\\nThe president doesn't win every battle but Martin believes Trump is mostly winning on immigration. That's the one thing he can't do to his base is to betray them on immigration, he says. It will be a big deal – which, according to some right-wing groups, includes holding down the number of refugees admitted into the U.S.\\n\\nThe final tally for refugee admissions in fiscal year 2018 is likely to be closer to 20,000 rather than the cap of 45,000, based on the recent pace of resettlements.\\n\\nWe are on the precipice, says Quigley of Human Rights First.\\n\\nCritics accuse the Trump administration of slowly smothering the refugee program and point to a recent announcement that the State Department will shutter dozens of resettlement offices run by voluntary agencies across the country.\\n\\nThe agencies are a convenient target, says Becca Heller with the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York. Taking down the [independent contractors] is a means to destroy the refugee program, she says.\\n\\nHeller's organization has been on the front lines of legal challenges to President Trump's immigration policies, including joining a lawsuit against a travel ban rolled out seven days after his inauguration that caused chaos at international airports. By early March, judges across the country had blocked the ban.\\n\\nWe are in a pitched battle for the continued existence of the U.S. refugee resettlement program, says Heller. The numbers are going to be low for the next few years and it's our job to keep them as high as we can.\\n\\nThe battles are increasingly being fought in the courts.\\n\\nThe president's latest legal setback came on Dec. 23, when a Seattle district judge blocked restrictions on refugees from 11 countries, nine of which are Muslim-majority nations. The judge also blocked the Trump administration's suspension of the follow-on program that reunites family members with refugees already in the U.S.\\n\\nThe pipeline is open again, says Smyers, with Church World Service. That pipeline includes more than 2,000 people who have been waiting for family reunification.\\n\\nHeller says there are limits to the president's powers to end the refugee resettlement program outright. Congress established the program's framework and would need to vote to eliminate it.\\n\\nI think [the refugee program is] under attack but I don't think it's over. For one thing, it's the law, says Heller, pointing to the 1980 Refugee Act that sets out the provisions for the admission of refugees of special humanitarian concern, and the 1965 immigration law that emphasizes family reunification.\\n\\nThe president may be able to temporarily prevent refugees from coming in, Heller says. It's not going to successfully dismantle the program without Congress."}
{"original": "It's A Miracle: Teenagers Take Out The Trash\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Junior Anaekwe Chris Junior Anaekwe\\n\\nChris Junior Anaekwe had an idea. In his home state of Anambra in southeastern Nigeria, there was a filthy gutter full of bottles and cans and trash, all covered in black gunk.\\n\\nAnd he thought it would be a good idea to convince the local kids — local teenagers who contributed to the mess — to clean it up.\\n\\nGood luck with that!\\n\\nBut with a bit of convincing and leading by example, Anaekwe, 28, was able to gather a group of nearly a dozen boys, ages 14 to 16, to help out. On the last Saturday of January, they used shovels to dig out the trash from the ditch.\\n\\nThe story went viral. After Anaekwe's former colleague Chimezie Anajama re-posted photos from his cleanup event on her Twitter account, the tweet has since been shared hundreds of times. Anajama, who works at a nonprofit called Policy Alert in Uyo, Nigeria, told NPR that the feeling of pride she has for Anaekwe (pictured below, wearing a red-checked kerchief), is an understatement.\\n\\nDear Twitter,\\n\\nA young Nigerian, Chris, just did something amazing. He influenced the youth of his street and led them to #cleanup the street gutters of #Onitsha. It is rare to see this without awaiting compensation. Bro, I am proud to've worked with you. Do RT to inspire others. pic.twitter.com/dZMAPYxdE1 — Chimezie Anajama (@MsChimezie) January 27, 2018\\n\\nWhile many Nigerians on Twitter lauded him for taking matters into his own hands and inspiring youth to do the same, others pointed to it as an example of Nigeria's failure to keep the streets clean.\\n\\nWe spoke to Anaekwe, a graduate of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, about his clean-up efforts.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nWhat inspired you to do this cleanup?\\n\\nWhen I came back to my home state of Anambra [after living for some time in Akwa Ibom state] and saw the dirty environment around our market — one of the biggest in Nigeria — I was inspired to do something.\\n\\nThe market has always been dirty, but the rate at which people are throwing trash now is increasing every day. It's a center of attraction. Most people pass through the street. And now it's become [a path for cars and motorbikes, adding traffic and pollution to the area]. No one is doing anything about the refuse going into the gutter.\\n\\nOn your Facebook page, you wrote that keeping the environment clean was part of your duty as an SDG ambassador. What is that?\\n\\nThe SDGs are the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, a group of targets and aid indicators [to address issues like global poverty and inequality]. I came to learn about them in 2016, when I attended a one-year program that we have here in Nigeria called the National Youth Service Course.\\n\\nAnyone who carries out the work of the SDGs in Nigeria, we call ourselves ambassadors. But it's not like we are officially recognized by the U.N.\\n\\nDuring my service, I worked with the Ministry of Economic Development in Akwa Ibom state, where I worked on a community development project to [achieve one of the SDGs].\\n\\nYou and your team, led by Anajama who originally shared the viral tweet, chose SDG 4, which is all about education. What did you do?\\n\\nWe did things like volunteer to provide blackboards to local schools.\\n\\nYour service ended in 2017, which means the cleanup event in January was not part of that program.\\n\\nI'm the kind of person who likes to help humanity. I'm not doing it because of what I'm going to gain. I'm doing it because this is what I want to do in life: help people around me.\\n\\nWhy did you enlist neighborhood kids to help?\\n\\nThey are the ones throwing trash in the gutter. They live around the area. If outsiders see the locals throw trash in the gutter, then they're going to do it, too. I wanted the kids to be the ones to clean up. I believe it will go a long way to teach them a lesson, that they are the protectors of their own environment.\\n\\nDid you get any pushback from the kids?\\n\\nIt was not easy. It took me two weeks to convince the youths that we really need to do this. A good, clean environment is next to godliness, and a prerequisite for a good life.\\n\\nAt first, many people rejected the idea. They were like no, I can't do this. Hire someone to do it. But I told them: If you want to lead, you need to be the first to do it. So I led by example. As I started to clean up, they saw I was serious and they joined me.\\n\\nHow long did it take you guys?\\n\\nAbout four to five hours.\\n\\nFrom the photos it looks like the trash is removed from the gutter but still piled up on the sides.\\n\\nAfter the cleanup we needed to dispose of the trash so it wouldn't get back into gutter. People needed to contribute money. Luckily, some people volunteered to pay the people who [collect] the trash, and they got rid of it later that day.\\n\\nDid you know you're a viral sensation? Hundreds of people have seen your story on Twitter, calling you an inspiration.\\n\\nI'm very happy and grateful at least that someone has appreciated what I did. Some people I don't even know. It's going to push me to do this more.\\n\\nSome on Twitter say they are disappointed in the authorities for not keeping the area clean.\\n\\nWe need to help ourselves. We must not wait for the government.\\n\\nHad you heard from the authorities about your efforts?\\n\\nThere was no government presence after the cleanup, no one told us great job.\\n\\nHas anything changed after the cleanup?\\n\\nThere's kind of like this new rule that applies to everybody living within that area. Throw your trash in the dustbin yourself. When you do that it reduces the rate of the gutter being filled up.\\n\\nAre you going to organize another cleanup?\\n\\nWhen I posted the photos to my Facebook I got so many messages from people inviting me to come to their street and help clean up. I promised them I will come if I have the time."}
{"original": "ALS Patients To Gain Quicker Access To Disability Benefits And Medicare\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption LumiNola/Getty Images LumiNola/Getty Images\\n\\nAnita Baron first noticed something was wrong in August 2018, when she began to drool. Her dentist chalked it up to a problem with her jaw. Then her speech became slurred. She managed to keep her company going — it offers financing to small businesses — but working became increasingly difficult for her as her speech worsened. Finally, nine months, four neurologists and countless tests later, Baron, now 66, got a diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\\n\\nALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease after the New York Yankees first baseman who died of the disease in 1941, destroys motor neurons, causing people to lose control of their limbs, their speech and, ultimately, their ability to breathe. It's usually fatal in two to five years, though about 10% of people survive ten years or more.\\n\\nPeople with ALS often must quit their jobs — and sometimes their spouses do, too, to provide care — leaving families in financial distress. A decade-long campaign by advocates highlighting this predicament notched a victory last month when Congress passed a bill opening key support programs earlier for ALS patients.\\n\\nWe're hopeful that it can serve as a model for other conditions.\\n\\nIn December, President Donald Trump signed the bill into law. It eliminates for ALS patients the required five-month waiting period to begin receiving benefits under the Social Security Disability Insurance program, which replaces at least part of a disabled worker's income. Gaining SSDI will also give these patients immediate access to Medicare health coverage.\\n\\nAdvocacy groups note that the Social Security Administration still will need to set up procedures for implementing the law, before patients will see the benefits.\\n\\nThe Muscular Dystrophy Association, an umbrella organization for people with 43 neuromuscular conditions, partnered with other ALS groups to support the bill to eliminate the SSDI waiting period.\\n\\nWe're hopeful that it can serve as a model for other conditions that may be similarly situated, says Brittany Johnson Hernandez, senior director of policy and advocacy at MDA.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to passage of the bill, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, sought to broaden the scope of the legislation to include other conditions. He pledged to continue to work on legislation to eliminate the SSDI waiting period for additional diseases that meet certain criteria, including those with no known cure and a life expectancy of less than five years.\\n\\nEliminating the SSDI waiting period has been a top priority for ALS advocates. There is no simple, single test or scan to confirm that someone has ALS, though symptoms can escalate rapidly. By the time people finally get the diagnosis, they are often already seriously disabled and unable to work; waiting five months longer for financial aid can be a burden, according to patients and families.\\n\\nFive months may seem like a short period of time, but for someone with ALS it matters, says Danielle Carnival, CEO of I Am ALS, an advocacy group. It's a huge win and will make a huge difference for people right away.\\n\\nEligibility for SSDI benefits generally requires people to have worked for about a quarter of their adult lives at jobs through which they paid Social Security taxes. Benefits are based on lifetime earnings; the average monthly SSDI benefit was $1,259 in June 2020, according to the Social Security Administration. (The average retirement benefit was $1,514 that month.)\\n\\nIt is imperative that as people become more and more debilitated and cannot work, that they have immediate access to SSDI.\\n\\nThe SSDI waiting period was intended to make sure the program served only people expected to have claims that would last at least a year, says Ted Norwood, chief legal officer at Integrated Benefits Inc. in Jefferson City, Mo., who represents SSDI applicants. But it isn't necessary, he adds, because disability rules now require that people have a condition that will keep them out of work at least a year or result in death.\\n\\nThe five-month waiting period serves no purpose as far as weeding out cases, Norwood says.\\n\\nExisting federal law also made special health care provisions for people with ALS and end-stage renal disease. Most people with disabilities must wait two years to be eligible for Medicare, but people with either of those two diseases can qualify sooner. ALS patients are eligible as soon as SSDI benefits start.\\n\\nThe new law could have made a big difference for Baron, who lives in Pikesville, Md. She and her husband, who works part time at a funeral parlor, didn't have comprehensive health insurance when she got sick. They were enrolled only in a supplemental medical plan that paid out limited cash benefits.\\n\\nBy the time Baron was diagnosed and her SSDI and Medicare came through, she and her husband had maxed out their credit cards, raided $10,000 from their IRA and gone to their family for money. They were $13,000 in debt. They sold their house and moved into a condo to save on expenses.\\n\\nIt is imperative that as [people] become more and more debilitated and cannot work, that they have immediate access to SSDI, Baron says.\\n\\nLike Sen. Lee, some patient advocates say the accommodations on disability benefits and Medicare made for patients with ALS should be extended to others with similarly intractable conditions.\\n\\nThe Social Security Administration has identified 242 conditions that meet the agency's standards for qualifying for disability benefits and are fast-tracked for benefit approval.\\n\\nOnce approved, people with these conditions still must wait five months before they receive any money. Now, under the new law, people with ALS can skip the waiting period, though no one else on the compassionate allowances list can.\\n\\nBreast cancer advocates are hoping for similar accommodations for people with metastatic breast cancer. Legislation introduced in the House and Senate in 2019 would have eliminated the SSDI waiting period for this group, but it did not pass.\\n\\nTackling the problem one condition at a time doesn't make sense, others argue.\\n\\nCan you imagine, one by one, people with these conditions trying to find people in the House and in the Senate to champion the bill? says Carol Harnett, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, which represents disability insurers.\\n\\nDeb McQueen-Quinn thinks it would be good if the new law set a precedent for eliminating the SSDI waiting period. At 55, McQueen-Quinn has lived with ALS since 2009, far longer than most.\\n\\nA former convenience store manager, she uses a wheelchair full time now. She knows all too well the toll of the disease. ALS runs in her family, and she's watched several family members, including her sister, brother and a cousin die of it. Researchers estimate that ALS is inherited in this way in up to 10% or so of ALS cases.\\n\\nHer sister, a former quality control engineer, was diagnosed in 2006 and died the following year — a week before she would have received her first SSDI payment.\\n\\nMcQueen-Quinn, who lives in Wellsville, N.Y., with her husband, has two children in their 30s. Her son, 33, carries the familial genetic mutation that leads to ALS. So far he hasn't developed symptoms. But it's for people like her son and other family members that she fought for the new law.\\n\\nNow that we've set the precedent, I'm sure you'll see a lot of other diseases go after this, she says.\\n\\nKHN is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."}
{"original": "Starbucks: No Purchase Needed To Use The Restroom\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nStarbucks Executive Chairman Howard Schultz said Thursday that Starbucks' bathrooms will now be open to everyone, whether paying customers or not.\\n\\nWe don't want to become a public bathroom, but we're going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key, Schultz said at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. Because we don't want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are 'less than.' We want you to be 'more than.' \\n\\nTwo black men, business partners Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, were arrested on April 12 as they sat in a Philadelphia Starbucks after not buying anything and asking to use the restroom.\\n\\nThe store manager called the police after asking them to leave — a terrible decision, Schultz said.\\n\\nVideo of their arrest sparked outrage on social media and accusations of racial bias. Protesters stood outside and inside the Philadelphia Starbucks store where the arrest occurred.\\n\\nThe company, the management and me personally — not the store manager — are culpable and responsible. And we're the ones to blame, Schultz said Thursday.\\n\\nWe were absolutely wrong in every way. The policy and the decision she made, but it's the company that's responsible, he added.\\n\\nSchultz said the company had a loose policy around letting only paying customers use the bathroom, though it was up to the discretion of individual store managers.\\n\\nThe company responded to the incident by announcing that it would close its more than 8,000 U.S. locations on the afternoon of May 29 for racial bias training. Schultz said on Thursday that the company brought in outside help to design the curriculum.\\n\\nSherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, is one of those helping to shape the training.\\n\\nRacism is deeply entrenched in our society, and any real effort to confront it means you have to be in it for the long haul, Ifill told NPR's All Things Considered last month. It means you have to be in it seriously. It means not just training. It means monitoring the effectiveness of that training.\\n\\nSchultz said that was the case and that the May 29 session is the beginning, not the end of an entire transformation of our training at Starbucks.\\n\\nHe said the company was also working with Stanley Nelson, director of the documentary Freedom Riders, to produce a documentary that would make sure that people understand: This is not a marketing thing; we're deeply committed to this.\\n\\nSchultz also addressed the company's past failure to address racial issues in the U.S. with its short-lived Race Together campaign in 2015. The company had encouraged baristas to write Race Together on customers' cups in an effort to start conversations about race.\\n\\nHe said the goal was to elevate the national conversation, the national discourse around race after the killings of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and Eric Garner in 2014 had brought up racial divide.\\n\\nStarbucks held meetings among employees about race, involving workers sharing both their pain and their bias, Schultz said, which spurred the idea for some type of outreach beyond the company's workers.\\n\\nIt didn't last one day.\\n\\nWithin two hours, the entire initiative was basically hijacked by social media. Hijacked by hate, by anonymous people who just pretty much stole the narrative, Schultz said. The company shut it down quickly after, mostly out of concern for the workers' safety, he said.\\n\\nNPR's Code Switch rounded up reactions at the time, many of which called the campaign ill-conceived and too sensitive and complex a topic to start with a coffee shop cashier."}
{"original": "The Diplomacy Challenges Facing Incoming President Biden\\n\\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nWhatever happens in the wake of the attack on the Capitol last week, a new administration will be entering the White House in just a matter of days. And so we want to turn our attention to key challenges facing the Biden administration, and we're going to focus here on foreign policy.\\n\\nPresident Trump leaves behind him a complicated legacy. His supporters say he highlighted long-dysfunctional or outdated policies and instigated new and productive relationships in the Middle East. On the other hand, he's pulled out of longstanding trade deals, escalated tensions with countries like China and Iran, aligned himself with strongmen and pursued an America-first agenda that critics see as dangerously unilateral.\\n\\nSo what needs to happen now that a new administration's coming to Washington? We've called two people with deep knowledge but different perspectives to talk about this. Kirsten Fontenrose is the director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. That's a global affairs think tank here in Washington, D.C. She also served as senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council under President Trump.\\n\\nKirsten Fontenrose, thank you so much for joining us once again.\\n\\nKIRSTEN FONTENROSE: Thank you for having me, Michel.\\n\\nMARTIN: And Nicholas Burns has a long career in diplomacy. He served in numerous key posts as ambassador, including to NATO. He served on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton, and he currently teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\\n\\nAmbassador Burns, thank you so much for speaking with us as well.\\n\\nR NICHOLAS BURNS: Thank you very much, Michel.\\n\\nMARTIN: And, Ambassador, I'm going to start with you. I mean, before we turn to what's next, I do want to get perspective from each of you on what's just happened here. I mean, on the day of the riot at the Capitol, you tweeted, quote, our credibility as a leader of the democratic world has hit rock bottom under Donald Trump. Noon on January 20 can't come fast enough.\\n\\nYour career in diplomacy spans decades. You've seen all kinds of upheavals all over the world. And I just have to ask, what went through your mind when you saw what happened this past Wednesday?\\n\\nBURNS: Well, Michel, I think it was one of the worst weeks in American history. We've suffered a severe blow to our credibility and our moral standing in the world. You think of Donald Trump's incitement, the assault on the Capitol, the seat of power of the United States - without question, I think these events this past week and a lot of other events over the last four years have stained our reputation.\\n\\nAnd what really pains me is it's a gift to Russia and China. You've seen what they've been saying the last couple of days. They're essentially charging that our commitment to democracy here in the United States is hollow. And our strongest allies are very worried. I think they're shocked by what happened. They're accustomed maybe to seeing this happen in authoritarian countries - an assault on a presidential palace or a parliament. But to see it happen in the United States, to see a mob of anti-democratic people attack the police and attack the rule of law - they're worried. I think our allies in Europe in particular are worried that this political contagion could spread to them.\\n\\nWe need to demonstrate over the next few months and few years that we're going to rid ourselves of authoritarianism and rule of law. And this is so important for our foreign policy - stand up for freedom of the press, for our Constitution and for the democratic order. We've lost that this week, and we need to rediscover it.\\n\\nMARTIN: Kirsten Fontenrose, your thoughts, particularly as a former member of this administration and as a national security expert?\\n\\nFONTENROSE: I agree with Ambassador Burns about the signals to Russia and China and the concerns about the debate regarding whether or not there's a greater strength in systems of democracy or systems of authoritarianism. I'll be looking to the seasoned members of Congress to use this shock to the system as a force to pull them a little bit closer together.\\n\\nI am concerned that we will see younger members of Congress who seem to be a bit more polarized reacting with continued, almost sectarian legislation. But I do think that the older, more seasoned legislators will look to this as a desperate call for help from our own governing system and say, we really need to come to the middle on some things. We really need to work together as much as we possibly can, or we're really risking, you know, a fracture in our society that will have repercussions for generations.\\n\\nMARTIN: So let's turn our attention now to what comes next. The Biden administration is going to enter the White House in under two weeks. What should be the top foreign policy item for them? And, Kirsten Fontenrose, I will start with you because, as I said, you know, President Trump does have his supporters, and some people do feel that he has made important strides in certain areas. And because you participated in this administration, I want to ask you first. What do you think the incoming administration's top priority should be?\\n\\nFONTENROSE: The No. 1 thought that keeps me awake at night when I think about both the outgoing administration and the incoming administration in terms of the formulation of foreign policy is the piece of American exceptionalism on which much of our foreign policy has empirically been based. That doesn't work anymore, but our policies have not adapted to that, both in the Trump administration and based on what we're hearing from the Biden team thus far.\\n\\nSo we can no longer apply pressure to other nations in terms of their foreign or domestic policy, their votes in the U.N., their defense acquisition plans with the assumption that they need us more than we need them. Even small and comparatively less powerful countries now have other options, specifically in the forms of China and Russia. And while we think these options are inviable in the long term, the governments and populations of other nations do not. You have China presenting itself as an alternative to the U.S. for economic growth, complete with cheap financing, kickbacks, the no-strings-attached policy. And you have Russia presenting itself as an alternative to the U.S. for national security - more specifically, your regime's security. They won't simply sell you arms and train your troops. They'll protect your seat and power. And these tantalizing options mean U.S. leverage and influence abroad is reduced. And I think that's dangerous.\\n\\nMARTIN: Ambassador Burns, is there anything about Trump's foreign policy record that should remain in place? I mean, obviously, you know, I think the criticisms are well-established for people who follow these issues, but he was the first to engage with certain hostile world leaders, like North Korea's Kim Jong Un. He renegotiated trade deals that some people believe did need to be worked anyway. His State Department helped reestablish formal ties or establish formal ties between Israel and a handful of Arab countries. Are there any things about Trump's foreign policy agenda that should stay?\\n\\nBURNS: I think his record of achievement is very thin in foreign policy. But you're right, Michel. Certainly encouraging Arab countries to recognize the state of Israel is positive. Illuminating the problem of China lying and cheating on its trade practices, trade commitments around the world is something, I think, that most Republicans and Democrats will agree with. Trying to achieve an agreement with Kim Jong Un was right in the beginning, but he - ultimately, President Trump didn't accomplish much. You have to give some credit for those. But on the whole, he's done enormous damage.\\n\\nMARTIN: You know, before we let you go, you know, it has to be said that a good portion of Trump's legacy regarding foreign affairs is about the way he treated his own experts - openly undermining intelligence from his own national security team, openly criticizing diplomats and public servants, people who'd given their lives to serving the American people. And I'm just, you know, wondering how you rebuild morale in those ranks among the diplomats and analysts, you know, military experts. And, Kirsten Fontenrose, I want to ask you, as a former member of this administration - I mean, you left some time ago, but do you share my assessment that morale is low? And I'd like to ask what you think needs to be done to address that.\\n\\nFONTENROSE: There was a little bit of a misunderstanding about the way some of the foreign policy decision-making worked under the Trump administration. To a great extent, the career experts were the voices that were making policy. But on certain issues, we would all wake up surprised by a decision that had been made overnight without any sort of policy coordination. That will stop. And I think that is what is encouraging people. But some of the smart policy-thinking has continued at the action officer level through even this administration. And I think the recognition that that will now be elevated is bringing back morale almost on its own.\\n\\nMARTIN: Ambassador, final thought from you. And I'm particularly curious about your thoughts here because you are teaching, you know, at the moment. You're teaching at Harvard's Kennedy School, where you're presumably trying to prepare the next generation, you know, of diplomats. And I'm interested in how your students have viewed all this in recent years and what you think it will take to restore morale. I assume you're in touch with your former colleagues, and you share my assessment that morale has been quite compromised. What would it take to fix that?\\n\\nBURNS: Donald Trump has done enormous damage to the State Department and Foreign Service, to the Justice Department, to the CIA and the State Department. I feel it very strongly. I was a career foreign service officer. We need to put responsibility back on our career officers. We - they need a stronger budget. We need much greater diversity - racial and ethnic, gender - in our foreign policy ranks. You see President-elect Biden doing that, and that's very positive. So I think, you know, maybe 10 days from now, if we had this interview again, we'd feel a little bit more hopeful because a new administration, I think, will bring us back to what made us a great country in the world, and that's rebuilding our core strength as a first priority.\\n\\nMARTIN: That's Ambassador Nicholas Burns. He's a former diplomat, and he's currently a professor of diplomacy and international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School. We were also joined by Kirsten Fontenrose. She's a former senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council under the Trump administration. She's currently director of the Atlantic Council Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.\\n\\nThank you both so much for joining us today.\\n\\nFONTENROSE: Thank you so much.\\n\\nBURNS: Thanks, Michel.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

{"original": "Another Campaign Donor Gets A Top Ambassadorship, But That's Par For The Course\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adam Hunger/AP Adam Hunger/AP\\n\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump told a group gathered at an inauguration luncheon Thursday that he is naming New York Jets owner Woody Johnson to be ambassador to the Court of St. James's, the ambassador to the U.K., a transition official confirmed.\\n\\nTrump's remarks came after the press was ushered out of the luncheon.\\n\\nJohnson was the Trump campaign's finance chairman. Appointing an NFL team owner is not without precedent. President Obama named Dan Rooney, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a campaign booster, as ambassador to Ireland in 2009.\\n\\nThe Court of St. James's is a far more high-profile position than Ireland, but the post has been a prominent landing spot for top campaign donors in the past, including for Obama.\\n\\nIn fact, in the U.S.'s more than 200-year history, just one person has been a career diplomat. For trivia lovers, that was Raymond Seitz, appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991.\\n\\nObama appointed Louis Susman, a former managing director of Citigroup and Obama campaign donor, to the post in 2009. And the current ambassador to the U.K. is Matthew Barzun, another Obama campaign donor and volunteer.\\n\\nSeitz was the deputy chief of mission at the embassy for years. It's the No. 2 post. Britain generally does it differently, sending its top lifelong diplomats to the U.S. and other important countries.\\n\\nBut even though many U.S. campaign donors are picked for plum ambassadorships, the U.S. has top career diplomats, those DCMs, in those key places.\\n\\nThis reporter in 2013 looked into the history of the different kinds of ambassadors both sides assign, when Vanity Fair magazine editor Anna Wintour was being discussed as a potential ambassador to the U.K.:\\n\\n 'It often is sort of a joke in London diplomatic circles,' said Erik Goldstein, a professor at Boston University who specializes in British foreign policy and who lived in England when Seitz was ambassador. Michael Hopkins, senior lecturer on American Foreign Policy at the University of Liverpool and editor of 'The Washington Embassy: British Ambassadors to Washington, 1939-1977,' added wryly, 'Most Foreign Office officials, if they were to say so, would regard it as 'disappointing' or 'perhaps not the best choice of envoy.' \\n\\nThe Foreign Office in the U.K. is responsible for U.K. foreign affairs.\\n\\nThese appointments can sometimes be perceived problematically. Seitz was succeeded by a Joint Chiefs chairman, but the ambassador before him, Henry Catto, hung the flag of the state of Texas at the embassy and put a 4-foot-tall wooden steer on its lawn.\\n\\nFormer British Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Westmacott defended the U.S. system — but did so diplomatically.\\n\\nIt's a very different system. It's easy to say that the U.S. system appoints ambassadors using criteria not related to merit or suitability, Westmacott told this reporter in 2013 when he was still ambassador to the U.S. But, he added, Often, it works very well.\\n\\nHe said that's the case because of the deep ties between the countries and the efficiency of the embassy staff (which is why it's important to have an excellent deputy, he said). But it's also often helpful for the ambassador to have the president's ear.\\n\\nThere's real value in someone having political clout, Westmacott said then. That's not always the case with professional diplomats."}

He spent much of it backing conservative politicians in the U.S. and Israel, shaping the political debate of both countries.\\n\\nHe was in the first wave of superwealthy Americans to take advantage of the Supreme Court's controversial Citizens United ruling, which opened the doors to eight- and nine-figure political donations so long as the money goes to independent superPACs and not candidates or party committees.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP\\n\\nSerial entrepreneur\\n\\nAdelson grew up poor in Dorchester, Mass. His parents were immigrants. His father drove a cab.\\n\\nWhen I was 12, I bought my first business, said Adelson, who started out selling newspapers on the street. He told the story during a videotaped court deposition in 2008. You know, you hold the newspaper in your hand and say, 'Hey, get your Daily Record.' We would yell that out. We would hawk newspapers, Adelson said.\\n\\nBy age 16, he had bought his second business — vending machines. And he kept on selling — packages of toiletries, spray cans of windshield de-icer. He ran a tour business and got into venture capital.\\n\\nThen, early in the personal computer era, he bought an influential computer trade show called Comdex and held it in Las Vegas.\\n\\nComdex took off, so Adelson bought the legendary Sands Hotel and Casino and built a million-square-foot convention center behind it. It was the start of a new Las Vegas, a place that catered to big conventions all week long — not just the weekend crowd that came in for gambling and the shows.\\n\\nI think if you had to single out one individual who brought that kind of component to the city, it would be Sheldon Adelson, said Sig Rogich, a longtime Las Vegas communications consultant. He was a transformational figure in Las Vegas history.\\n\\nIn 1996, Adelson imploded the Sands and built the Venetian, a complex with more than 8,000 rooms and more than 150 stores and restaurants. It's a model that he replicated in Macau and Singapore with enormous profit.\\n\\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, and you can't get rid of it. So that's what I did, Adelson told the American Gaming Association convention in 2014.\\n\\nAlong the way, Adelson had battles. In the Comdex days, he fought the other casino owners. When he put up the Venetian, he froze out the unions that had represented workers at the old Sands.\\n\\nAnybody who stands up to him or stands in his way, he'll try to crush, said D. Taylor, international president of the labor group UNITE HERE and a long time labor leader in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIn 2015, the Adelson family bought the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper, in a sale originally shrouded in mystery and investigated by the publication's own journalists. There were several newsroom resignations after that sale, including a columnist who was told he could not write about Adelson.\\n\\nThe Adelson primary\\n\\nThe fortune Adelson made in the casino business was spent generously on donations to Jewish causes, medical research and the Republican Party. He and his wife, Miriam, gave around $500 million over the past eight years to Republican and conservative campaigns.\\n\\nThe couple's prolific political giving led to what was sometimes called the Adelson primary, in which GOP presidential hopefuls would flock to Las Vegas to court Adelson and the Republican Jewish Coalition.\\n\\nHey, listen, Sheldon, thanks for inviting me, said then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich at one such event in 2014. I don't travel to these things much, but this is one that I thought was really, really important.\\n\\nDuring the 2016 presidential primaries, Adelson initially appeared to back Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who received the endorsement of Adelson's Review-Journal. Unlike Rubio, Donald Trump said he didn't need Adelson's money. If Sheldon gives to him, he'll have total control over Rubio, and that's the problem with the way the system works, said Trump in an interview with Fox News.\\n\\nBut after early reservations, the Adelsons backed Trump's 2016 election effort; they gave $5 million to his inaugural committee and then donated about $500,000 to the legal defense fund for his White House aides. During the 2018 midterms, the Adelsons donated more than $100 million to Republicans.\\n\\nTrump awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018; the citation praised her work and philanthropy in combating addiction. You have been truly incredible, Trump told her at the event, before looking out to the crowd. Here to celebrate Miriam's award is Sheldon. Where is Sheldon? Where is Sheldon? Where is he? There he is. Oh, you didn't make the front row. He's probably angry.\\n\\nIn statement Tuesday, Trump said, His ingenuity, genius, and creativity earned him immense wealth, but his character and philanthropic generosity his great name. Sheldon was also a staunch supporter of our great ally the State of Israel.\\n\\nWhile Adelson was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party, he wasn't always in sync with the party's positions, telling reporters in 2012, On the social issues, I'm not pro-life; I'm pro-choice.\\n\\nAdelson continued to support Trump in his reelection bid, though about a week after the election, his newspaper's editorial board said the defeated president was trying to delay the inevitable. The editorial column blasted the unfounded claims of voter fraud Trump and his allies were perpetuating.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBirthright Israel; Jerusalem embassy\\n\\nAdelson also spent heavily on conservative causes in Israel.\\n\\nHe was a primary backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a biography of the Israeli leader by journalist Anshel Pfeffer, Netanyahu helped the Adelsons secure unprecedented access to hold their wedding reception in the Israeli parliament building.\\n\\nIn 2007, Adelson launched Israel Today, a free daily that has become Israel's largest circulation newspaper. It features cheerleading coverage of Netanyahu and his family, a key asset in Netanyahu's longtime quest for positive press coverage in Israel. When Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress in 2015 against the Iran nuclear deal, Adelson was in the gallery.\\n\\nAdelson also helped bankroll Birthright Israel, a program partially funded by the Israeli government to send Jewish youth from around the world to Israel on free guided trips.\\n\\nHe was a forceful advocate for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Adelson heavily supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign in part because of his support for moving the embassy.\\n\\nWhile the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations rejected such a move, Trump's administration embraced the policy.\\n\\nAdelson even offered to pay for at least part of the cost of building a new embassy.\\n\\nAt the dedication ceremony for the new embassy in May 2018, the Adelsons sat in the front row just a few feet away from Netanyahu, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nNPR international correspondent Daniel Estrin contributed reporting to this story."}
{"original": "Democrats Want To Work On A Sound Border System, Rep. Thompson Says\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump made a case last night that he is not against immigrants. He says he is against those who break the law.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\\n\\nINSKEEP: The president made that case from behind his desk in the Oval Office. It was a pose, before the cameras, that predecessors since Harry Truman have assumed. In this case, the president was demanding a border wall as his price for reopening parts of the government. Those listening to the speech included our next guest. He is Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. He is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which means he is the newly empowered chairman.\\n\\nMr. Chairman, good morning.\\n\\nBENNIE THOMPSON: Good morning.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Do you accept the President's contention there that illegal immigration is a drag on the country?\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Well, I think, first of all, you have to say that the president didn't give us anything new. We have a problem with immigration, but we can fix it. What we're dealing with now, though, is a manufactured problem created by some policies implemented by this administration that has actually put a greater strain on our system of immigration.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Let me make sure I understand there. You say there's a real problem and a manufactured problem. Define the real problem, please.\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Well, the problem is we have about 13 million people in this country who are here, in one form or another, illegally - visa overstays or what have you. But this notion that those individuals are terrorists, those individuals are murderers, robbers - very few of them. Our experience and information lead us to believe that many of them are just hardworking people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. Our system of immigration in this country needs fixing. And so what we're trying to say to the president is, you don't have to fan the flames of hysteria to fix an immigration system. You just need to do it. A wall won't fix an immigration system. Common sense, listening to the professionals who say technology and some other things is the way to go is how you begin the process of fixing an immigration system. So...\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, the president is correct, though, that there are people who cross the border illegally or who arrive seeking asylum. And as you know, there has been an increase recently in the number of unaccompanied minors and families coming to the border. And in his speech last night, the president argued that a border wall is not just better for citizens, in his view, it's also better for migrants if they're deterred from coming. Let's listen to some of that.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\\n\\nTRUMP: This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States - a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Now, Mr. Chairman, this is something the Obama administration could have said. And in fact, they did say this is a very dangerous journey, it's hazardous for people, it would be better for many if they didn't come. Is the president right?\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. We wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. So what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. Teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. So what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. So again, let me be very clear. Democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is homeland security at risk because of the shutdown? There are Coast Guard and other homeland security personnel who are not being paid even though they are working.\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no real correlation between border security and this shutdown. The president has tried to manufacture and up the ante by this shutdown. We have some 800,000 employees. We have 450 airports in this country manned by TSA workers who may or may not get paid this Friday. That's not how you run an effective system of national security for those who travel. Our Coast Guard individuals, as you know, recently got paid because of a unique formula for handling the money. I'm not certain that they will be able to do it next time. Those men and women of TSA and the Coast Guard do a wonderful job.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So is homeland security at greater risk because of that situation?\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question they're at risk because the morale of people working at airports - and they are some of the lowest-paid people in the system. And so now we are doing this to them. My comment is - Mr. President, put the people back to work so we can keep America safe.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciated talking to you.\\n\\nTHOMPSON: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Bennie Thompson of Mississippi chairs the House Homeland Security Committee.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "Lehigh University Revokes President Trump's Honorary Degree\\n\\nLehigh University has revoked an honorary degree that President Trump held for more than 30 years. The Pennsylvania school's board of trustees held a special vote this week after Trump incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nThe decision came after a special session of the Executive Committee on Thursday and was fully affirmed earlier today, student newspaper The Brown and White reported.\\n\\nNumerous petitions had previously sought to rescind the honor for Trump, who was awarded the degree when he spoke at the school's commencement ceremony in 1988.\\n\\nThree years ago, one such effort garnered nearly 80,000 signatures.

{"original": "In 2005, Trump Was Hit With A Tax That He Now Wants To Abolish\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\\n\\nPresident Trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.\\n\\nA two-page tax return, filed by Trump for 2005 and revealed Tuesday, may suggest one reason. Because of the AMT, Trump was required to pay about $38 million in taxes on income of more than $150 million that year.\\n\\nWithout it, Trump's bill would have been a lot lower.\\n\\nThe AMT, which Trump has proposed eliminating, operates as a sort of parallel tax: If you claim too many of the wrong kind of deductions and try to get by with paying too little, you automatically find yourself bumped into the world of the AMT, where different rules — and higher rates — apply.\\n\\nIn other words, if you thought you were going to lower your tax bill by claiming a lot of deductions, think again.\\n\\nThe AMT was passed into law in 1969, amid public outrage over reports that some 155 ultrawealthy people had escaped paying federal taxes altogether by using loopholes and tax shelters, says Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nBut over time, it has morphed and changed and now sucks in a lot of taxpayers who are merely very comfortable.\\n\\nIt is a stupid tax. It's poorly targeted, Burman says.\\n\\nThe people most likely to be hit with the AMT are not billionaires, but people earning incomes of $500,000 to $1 million a year. Burman says 62 percent of them are expected to pay the tax in 2017.\\n\\nOf those who earn between $200,000 and $500,000 a year, 31 percent will pay the tax.\\n\\nBut among those making more than $1 million a year, only 18 percent get hit.\\n\\nThat's because the AMT tends to kick in for certain kinds of deductions more than others.\\n\\nIf you live in a high-tax place such as New Jersey or New York and deduct the state and local taxes you pay, that deduction will be counted toward the AMT. The same goes for people who claim children and other dependents as personal exemptions.\\n\\nBut the types of deductions favored by the ultrawealthy, such as tax shelters, don't get counted, Burman says. Income from capital gains also gets preferential treatment under the AMT.\\n\\nThat means someone like Warren Buffett, who gets most of his income from stock investments, can pay a very low rate without triggering the AMT, while a well-paid executive from Westchester County with lots of kids probably can't.\\n\\nWhy Trump got hit by the AMT in 2005 isn't clear without more details than were included in the two-page return released Tuesday night by journalist David Cay Johnston.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of technical preferences that can throw you onto the AMT, and it looks like Donald Trump fell afoul of one or two of them, Burman says.\\n\\nWhatever the reasons, the AMT meant Trump had to pay much higher taxes than he otherwise would.\\n\\nWithout the alternative minimum tax, Donald Trump would have paid a lower tax rate in 2005 than the poorest half of Americans — just 3.48 percent — despite income of more than $150 million. Trump wants to abolish the AMT. Now we know why, said Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente.\\n\\nTrump is by no means the first politician to take aim at the AMT. In fact, economists, tax lawyers and members of Congress have long discussed abolishing or reforming it.\\n\\nBut it's never happened, in part because it raises too much money. The AMT is projected to bring in some $40 billion to $50 billion a year to the federal government over the next decade."}
{"original": "Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed\\n\\nRachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nThe president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.\\n\\nI'm joined now by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. He was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign. Scott, welcome back to the program.\\n\\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.\\n\\nMARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.\\n\\nMARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.\\n\\nJENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.\\n\\nMARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?\\n\\nJENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.\\n\\nMARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?\\n\\nJENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...\\n\\nMARTIN: Although...\\n\\nJENNINGS: ...And gets us past this issue.\\n\\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?\\n\\nJENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.\\n\\nMARTIN: Which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. Republican strategist Scott Jennings for us this morning.\\n\\nScott, thanks, as always. We appreciate it.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Thank you very much.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

The reports coincide with the World Economic Forum, where elites gather in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.\\n\\nThe latest report — published on Monday and called Public Good or Private Wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. In 2017, it was 43 individuals.\\n\\nBut would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?\\n\\nOxfam thinks so. Its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to U.N. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.\\n\\nThe rich are doing very well — thank you very much — and those on the wrong end are working harder and harder for less and less everywhere we look, says Paul O'Brien, Oxfam America's vice president for policy and advocacy.\\n\\nReducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, Oxfam argues.\\n\\nAnd that's certainly a pressing issue. Even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the World Bank has warned that progress is slowing. What's more worrying, according to Oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to Forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.\\n\\nBut is a global wealth tax realistic?\\n\\nO'Brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. But he is optimistic about the odds. Major agencies like the International Monetary Fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the World Economic Forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.\\n\\nBut until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. The Oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.\\n\\nAccording to Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.\\n\\nFor example, a couple of years ago, the Tax Justice Network worked with the Australian Taxation Office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through Singapore. Oil and gas giant Chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.\\n\\nBut not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.\\n\\nProper taxation is important, but it's one thing among many that we need to do to address poverty, says Vijaya Ramachandran, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\\n\\nRamachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. The Oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.\\n\\nCash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. The idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. The stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.\\n\\nThen there are what Harvard Business School professor and co-author of The Prosperity Paradox Clayton Christensen calls market-creating innovations. Christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. But outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in Mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. These types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.\\n\\nWhether through a global wealth tax or other practices, Oxfam's O'Brien just wants to see inequality reduced now.\\n\\nHopefully, we won't have to talk next year, he told me, because we'll have solved global extreme inequality!\\n\\nJoanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequality.

While the South Korean region is known for its frigid winters, major snowstorms are rare in February.\\n\\nThat's where Snow Making Inc. (SMI), comes in. The Michigan-based company has installed snow-making machines at seven Winter Olympics, including Pyeongchang.\\n\\nDepending on which venue it is, we estimate between 90 and 98 percent of the snow that's there has been machine-made and produced in advance of the games, Joe VanderKelen, president of SMI, tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson.\\n\\nThe Games' organizers spent nearly $6 million to bring in snow cannons, which push cold water and pressurized air through a snow gun to produce artificial snow. At past Olympics in Sochi and Vancouver, the host cities also deployed fake snow on mountain ranges due to unseasonably warmer weather.\\n\\nMachine-made snow is like one-week or two-week-old natural snow that's been sitting there and takes a while to go into a different grain size, and actually can become a better surface once it's tilled for the athletes, VanderKelen says.\\n\\nSurprisingly, athletes prefer manufactured snow because it is more consistent, he adds. When preparing the courses, organizers will actually push off natural snow before spreading the fake stuff.\\n\\nThe racers like a very hard surface that minimizes rutting, so that between the 40 and 60 competitors that might race they're trying to keep that surface as consistent as they can as they carve those gates and those corners, VanderKelen says. So they really like a very hard surface, and they don't like natural snow at all.\\n\\nSMI's fully automated snow-making system consists of 100 snow cannons posted on towers and carriages at the Jeongseon Alpine Center, according the company's website. The entire system can store up to 33.6 million gallons of water, which is enough to fill 51 Olympic-size swimming pools.\\n\\nTake the Jeongseon Alpine venue. We've had people over there since early November, and they pretty much made snow from November 15 until about January 10, VanderKelen says. They converted around 200 million gallons of water into snow during that time and then stored it until the games began.\\n\\nThe next host of the Winter Olympics, Beijing, will almost completely depend on man-made snow, according to a 2015 report by the International Olympic Committee.\\n\\nThere would be no opportunity to haul snow from higher elevations for contingency maintenance to the race courses so a contingency plan would rely on stockpiled man-made snow, the IOC wrote, a month before it designated Beijing the 2022 host.\\n\\nThough harmful to the environment, the technology behind man-made show has become more energy efficient, VanderKelen says.\\n\\nThe end result for the mountain resorts around the world is they're making a lot more snow, a lot more efficiently, at a lot warmer temperatures, for a lot less money, he says.\\n\\nBut a lack of snowfall has proven harmful to the commercial ski industry. A low-snow year can cost the U.S. winter sports industry up to $1 billion, according to a report by Protect Our Winters, a climate advocacy nonprofit. Less snow can deter people from hitting the slopes and delay the start of the season.\\n\\nSnow is currency, Auden Schendler, vice president of sustainability at Aspen Ski Resorts and a Protect Our Winters board member told NPR. Snowmaking is a stop gap, it's an insurance policy. But it doesn't replace the natural product."}

{"original": "Pope Francis Accuses Bishop's Critics Of Slander, Riling Sex Abuse Victims In Chile\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nPope Francis has accused victims of sexual abuse in Chile of slander, saying their attacks on a bishop who's accused of covering up the abuse amount to calumny. The remarks triggered anger and demonstrations in Chile, where several churches have been firebombed in the past week.\\n\\nOn the last day of his visit to Chile, Francis set the simmering resentment some hold against the Catholic Church to a full boil with his defense of Bishop Juan Barros. The bishop has been hotly criticized ever since the pope appointed him in 2015. Barros was the protégé of Rev. Fernando Karadima, a notorious disgraced priest who served in the southern city of Osorno and who was found guilty and dismissed in 2011 for abusing dozens of minors over a decades-long period beginning in the 1980s.\\n\\nKaradima became the face of the church's sexual abuse scandal in Chile. And his victims say they believe Barros knew about the priest's abuse but did nothing to stop it or report it. As recently as this week, Barros has denied witnessing any abuse.\\n\\nIn trying to reconcile his church with its followers over decades of sexual abuse, the pope has embraced a zero tolerance policy. When a Chilean journalist asked Francis about Barros, the Associated Press reports, Francis replied, The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I'll speak.\\n\\nHe added, There is not one shred of proof against him. It's all calumny. Is that clear?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters\\n\\nThe comment immediately set off a backlash, with abuse victims speaking out on Twitter and elsewhere, with many saying the statement echoed the skepticism and denial that had met with their claims. One victim, Juan Carlos Cruz, replied, As if one could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others while Barros stood by.\\n\\nAdding to the drama, the exchange took place one week after the Associated Press reportedly Francis had written a letter in January of 2015 about the Vatican's attempt to cope with the fallout from Karadima. In it, the agency said, Francis acknowledged the controversy around Barros and referred to a previous plan to ask for Barros' resignation.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the pope's remarks dismissing Barros' critics came in Iquique, where the controversial bishop was on hand as Francis celebrated a mass at a beach.\\n\\nWith Pope Francis' visit to Chile now over, the newspaper Clarin is calling it the worst of his five years as pope, citing his remarks about Barros and comparatively low turnouts for Francis' public events in the country.\\n\\nDays earlier, Francis had asked for forgiveness and sought to heal old wounds over the Church's handling of abuse. On the first day of his visit to Chile, he spoke of the pain and shame, that I feel at the irreparable damage caused to children by ministers of the Church.\\n\\nShortly after making that statement on Tuesday, Francis met with a small group of victims of sexual abuse in Santiago, in a meeting at which the Vatican says the pope listened to them and prayed and cried with them.\\n\\nAt least five Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week, some with firebombs. The attacks have also included vandalism and graffiti, including accusations and threats against Pope Francis. After spending several days in Chile, the pope is now in Peru on the next stage of his tour."}
{"original": "Senate Leader McConnell Condemns GOP Objections To Election Results\\n\\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who worked for Sen. Mitch McConnell, about the outgoing majority leader, and the GOP's response to the mob that broke into the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nTwo Senate elections in Georgia have given Democrats control of the United States Senate. That means that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell loses his post after six years in power. McConnell's final act as majority leader is proving to be his response to the president's continuing attack on democracy.\\n\\nWhen Joe Biden's win became clear in early November, Mitch McConnell stood on the Senate floor. Instead of congratulating the obvious winner, he gave a carefully worded statement. He did not repeat the president's false claims of fraud but did say the formal process should play out.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMITCH MCCONNELL: President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Six weeks later, in mid-December, Joe Biden's win was confirmed after every legal challenge failed. McConnell then spoke again.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMCCONNELL: The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.\\n\\nINSKEEP: In recent days, McConnell tried to prevent Congress from debating the baseless claims of fraud in yesterday's session, but it was not until yesterday that McConnell forcefully and in detail refuted the president's election claims as completely baseless. He added that Congress was no place to litigate them.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nMCCONNELL: We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts and the states - they've all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell said his vote to override objections to this election was the most important vote of his 36 years in Congress. As he spoke, insurrectionists were already descending on the Capitol. They briefly disrupted the proceedings, although they resumed and were completed overnight.\\n\\nScott Jennings is with us now. He is a Republican strategist who has worked with Mitch McConnell over the years. Mr. Jennings, welcome back to the program.\\n\\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Thanks and good morning.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell's speech yesterday was really quite powerful, but I have to ask if it was a mistake for him to wait two months to give it.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Well, he works at the speed of the institution. I mean, I think most Republicans said after the election that if Donald Trump had issues with the votes that he should take it to court. That's the proper venue for the adjudication of claims. He did that. Every single court that looked at it did not agree. The Electoral College met. And that's immediately when Mitch McConnell acknowledged that Joe Biden was the president-elect. And then yesterday, after the president would not stop indulging this fantasy that the election was stolen, Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor and made a powerful speech. And I thought, frankly, it was one of his finest hours. It's regrettable that he had to actually give that speech.\\n\\nDonald Trump is the cause of everything that happened yesterday. Some people stood tall, and some people gave in to it still. And I thought McConnell was one of those that stood tall.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You're exactly correct that McConnell did not give in to it yesterday, but I do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. Mitch McConnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. He did not always support the president. On a number of occasions, he criticized the president. But there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. Should he have said more sooner?\\n\\nJENNINGS: I think the president over the years had an agenda, and Mitch McConnell felt like that as the Republican leader, it was his job to try to help the president get outcomes on that agenda. He did that and, frankly, did it pretty faithfully and did get some outcomes for the president that I'm not sure he could've gotten without Mitch McConnell's skill in legislative maneuvering.\\n\\nBut, look; once the election was over and the claims had been adjudicated and the votes were counted, Mitch McConnell stuck by the institution and the norms and the gears of our democracy. And he was not about to let Donald Trump live in an alternate bubble. And I think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. And he - and - you know, convinced most of the Republicans in the Senate that the Republicans should not indulge what Donald Trump was doing. It's, I think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.\\n\\nBut I thought McConnell did what he did on the calendar of the institution, according to the gears of our democracy. Wasn't fast enough for some people, but he did it. And I think the message that he gave was exactly the right one.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Let's hear one of those who indulged the president yesterday, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Even after the violence and the disruption in the Capitol, when senators came back in and the House of Representatives came back in, he spoke on the Senate floor last night.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nJOSH HAWLEY: We do need an investigation into irregularities, fraud. We do need a way forward together. We need election security reforms. I bet my friends on the other side of the aisle don't disagree with that.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Which was a common theme of the people who supported the president here. They didn't repeat the president's lies quite so much as just saying, look; there are allegations we should investigate. But this is an obvious cynical ploy. Why do you think a large part of the party was addicted to that?\\n\\nJENNINGS: Well, I think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. And to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. The president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. These things are decided in the courts and at the state level. And to go on the Senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. They wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.\\n\\nAfter the insurrection, Hawley and Cruz and the rest had every opportunity and every reason to say, this has gone far enough. And the fact that they plowed forward and pushed it into the middle of the night still, I thought, was a disgrace to the institution and, frankly, a disgrace to the Republican Party.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So Mitch McConnell now becomes the minority leader, but I'm not even sure that's exactly the right term when it's a 50-50 Senate and Kamala Harris, the vice president, is necessary to break ties. So he will still be in a very powerful position, but not dictating the schedule of the institution. Do you think that he anticipates using his power to work with the new president, oppose the new president? What?\\n\\nJENNINGS: You know, I think they'll have a power-sharing agreement akin to what happened several years ago in a 50-50 Senate. Democrats will have control of the floor. It'll make it easier for Joe Biden to form his government. I don't think Republicans intend to try to stop Biden from forming a government. But certainly, they're not going to lay down their conservative principles.\\n\\nAnd I think McConnell's view is in a closely divided government, policy ought to be made between the 40-yard lines. I do think he considers Joe Biden a friend. He was the only Senate Republican to go to Beau Biden's funeral. I think he thinks there are areas where they can work together. And after what happened yesterday...\\n\\nINSKEEP: About 10 seconds.\\n\\nJENNINGS: ...I hope it was a wake-up call to everybody in Washington that living in this fantasy alternate reality has to stop because there are real consequences.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Republican strategist Scott Jennings, it's always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Thanks, Steve.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHRISTIAN SCOTT'S DANZIGER)\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "How The Trump Campaign Weakened The Republican Platform On Aid To Ukraine\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nOne of the questions raised over the course of this year's presidential race is about how a President Trump would deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nOne reason to wonder: the Republican Party platform's new language on policy towards Ukraine.\\n\\nWhen Republican Party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in Cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of then-presumptive nominee Donald Trump on most issues — except when it came to a future Republican administration's stance on Ukraine.\\n\\nIt started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U.S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian government, which is fighting a separatist insurrection backed by Russia. Denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.\\n\\nDenman is a long time GOP activist from Texas. When she presented her proposal during a platform subcommittee meeting last month, two gentleman, whom Denman said were part of the Trump campaign, came over, looked at the language, and asked that it be set aside for further review.\\n\\nShe says after further discussion the pair had to make some calls and clear it. She says they found the language was still too strong.\\n\\nThe Trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change Denman's proposal. It went from calling on the U.S. to provide Ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.\\n\\nIt's more than semantics. Many Republicans have been demanding the Obama administration provide a more robust response to Russia's incursions in Ukraine.\\n\\nDenman was steam rolled, said Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC, think tank, who believes the language the Trump campaign approved is weaker. And she says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.\\n\\nHaring was referring to Trumps appearance on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos last month, when Trump said Vladimir Putin is not going to go into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he's not going to go into Ukraine.\\n\\nOf course, Russia did go into Ukraine when it invaded Crimea two years ago and backed separatist fighters in other parts of the country. Trump later said that he meant Putin would not go into Ukraine on his watch, if he were President.\\n\\nStill, that comment raised eyebrows, especially combined with his campaign chairman Paul Manafort's past work for deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally.\\n\\nAnother GOP delegate on the platform committee, Rachel Hoff, is a national security analyst with the American Action Forum and believe the final platform language signals that a Trump administration would refuse to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine.\\n\\nThis puts Trump out of step certainly with Republican leadership but I would also say mainstream conservative foreign policy or national security opinion, Hoff said.\\n\\nRepublicans in Congress have approved providing arms to the Ukrainian government but the White House has resisted, saying that it would only encourage more bloodshed.\\n\\nIt's a rare Obama administration policy that the Trump campaign seems to agree with."}
{"original": "Former Defense Sec. William Cohen On Trump's 'Tough' Foreign Policy Rhetoric\\n\\nFormer Defense Secretary and GOP Sen. William Cohen talks with Steve Inskeep about the Trump administration's approach to the world, as reflected in recent actions and phone calls with world leaders.\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nLet's try to make sense of the way President Trump talks about other countries.\\n\\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\\n\\nRussia is seen as undermining U.S. interests around the world, but the president speaks of a new and better relationship.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Australia is among the most vital U.S. allies, and the president harangued the prime minister by phone.\\n\\nMARTIN: Then there's Iran, China and North Korea. The president talks of getting tougher on all of them.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And when North Korea talked of testing ballistic missiles that could reach the United States, Trump tweeted, it won't happen. That got former Clinton-era Defense Secretary William Cohen wondering what step is next.\\n\\nWILLIAM COHEN: Well, it's one thing to talk tough about North Korea. The question is does the president have a policy in mind in terms of how he's going to alter the conduct that is currently being carried on because you can't tell what the North Korean leader might do in response to either verbal or rhetorical threats coming from the administration. So you have to take care.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Cohen is Republican, once a senator from Maine, and he worries about possible Russian influence on the president. He says President Trump's hints at dropping sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine could undermine longtime alliances.\\n\\nCOHEN: It may be that President Trump is fulfilling his negotiating strategy by setting out an extreme position and then having it walk back to something that's more responsible. If it is and it works, OK, he'll get credit for that. But to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You're saying that he could inadvertently encourage Russian aggression, inadvertently encourage North Korean aggression because those countries might get the idea that the United States is not really truly standing behind its allies.\\n\\nCOHEN: Or they may fear that he's about to take preemptive action, in which case they might try to preempt that. What I'm saying is that the president of the United States needs to take more care about what is said and how it's said.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I think we could recite the White House defense ourselves now. Why are you so bothered by this? It's refreshing the way that he talks. He's speaking his mind. People like that. What's wrong with that line of thinking?\\n\\nCOHEN: Well, it takes a long time to build an alliance. It can be destroyed very quickly. And it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what I would call, like a blind Samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of World War II. Those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera. If you take down the pillars, what replaces it?\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is the danger of war involving the United States greater than it was?\\n\\nCOHEN: Well, you have people like former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry now writing that his biggest fear is we're going to have a nuclear explosion in his lifetime. That's worrisome.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Why would that be more likely?\\n\\nCOHEN: Well, because the notion of nuclear weapons has been what we call normalized - this is just another weapon.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Remarks that the president made while campaigning.\\n\\nCOHEN: Yeah. The notion that proliferation of nuclear weaponry may be in the overall interests of the world I think contravenes every notion that we've had since the bomb was created.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I want to be as clear as we can that the president, I think, if you talk about inviting Japan to get nuclear weapons, he said different things. I think he may have even denied that he ever said the thing that he had in fact previously said. So he seems to have backed off. But it sounds like you're just arguing that that uncertainty about what the president means is the problem.\\n\\nCOHEN: The uncertainty and the notion that is so cavalierly discussed. With the amount of nuclear weaponry in existence today, the life of this planet is at stake. So it's really incumbent on all of us to find ways to prevent something accidental from taking place because the consequences are existential for us.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is the president's tough talk to adversaries or potential enemies really that much different than other presidents? I'm thinking about the way that President Obama, before the Iran nuclear deal, made a blanket statement - Iran's not going to get a nuclear weapon. It would have been hard to mistake that as anything but a threat.\\n\\nCOHEN: Well, you have to put it in the context of President Obama and how he conducted himself throughout his eight years of the presidency. Every instinct on his part was to find ways not to talk belligerently or to take action. In fact, Ronald Reagan talked tough as well, but people had a sense of how Ronald Reagan was going to govern. President Trump comes in with no government experience in a - and accustomed to communicating in a manner which doesn't lend itself to accountability. So is this a way to conduct policy? I don't think so. But, you know, he's president and we're not.\\n\\nINSKEEP: William Cohen was a Republican senator and defense secretary under President Bill Clinton.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "The Republican Party After Trump\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nJust a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.\\n\\nWhat is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nRYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you.\\n\\nSIMON: I feel like I have to put it this bluntly. Has the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ed Brooke become the party of the Proud Boys and Confederate flags and racism?\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.\\n\\nSIMON: But before you go on, Washington Post/ABC poll says nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want to follow Trump's lead.\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.\\n\\nSIMON: From your point of view, Mr. Costello, does the Republican Party need to renounce Donald Trump?\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.\\n\\nAnd some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.\\n\\nSIMON: And - well, I have to ask, Mr. Costello, and I know polls can go up and down, but if more than half of the people who identify themselves as Republicans say the party ought to support Donald Trump, after all that's happened, he's still a Republican. Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.\\n\\nBut to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.\\n\\nSIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.\\n\\nTo me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.\\n\\nAnd so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.\\n\\nSIMON: Ryan Costello is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Thanks so much, sir.\\n\\nCOSTELLO: Thank you very much. Take care.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "For These Families, Vouchers Bring A Needed Change\\n\\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\\n\\nDorothy, of Spring Hill, Fla., has a 15-year-old son with spina bifida and developmental delays, and her 13-year-old daughter is, she says, mildly autistic. Neither was happy at public school.\\n\\nMy son was in a lockdown classroom with gang members. It was a bad situation. I was afraid he was going to get hurt, Dorothy says. My daughter was getting bullied because she spoke out of turn or would get upset easily. Twenty kids in a classroom was a lot for her.\\n\\nToday, Dorothy is homeschooling her son and daughter with the help of a novel item on the school choice menu: the Gardiner Scholarship. This voucher program, created in 2014, can be used by students with specific disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. It has grown rapidly and is now used by 7,000 Florida students.\\n\\nA controversial education bill now before Florida's governor, Rick Scott, would add $30 million to the program's budget, amid other expansions to school choice.\\n\\nUsing the Gardiner, which provides an average $10,000 for each child, Dorothy has been able to purchase tablet computers, a camera, a telescope, books, online courses and other supplies and equipment to customize a curriculum for both teenagers.\\n\\nThey are doing better than I ever could have imagined, says Dorothy (we're not using her last name to protect her children's privacy). Neither take any [psychiatric] medication anymore. There are no overstimulation issues.\\n\\nOnly a few other states, including New Hampshire and North Carolina, support homeschoolers. Compared with charter school choice or private school vouchers, these programs give families the widest possible leeway to customize their children's education while still receiving public support to pay for it.\\n\\nPresident Trump has shed a spotlight on this idea. His 100-day plan mentioned redirect[ing] education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. However, some in the homeschooling movement oppose vouchers. The Home School Legal Defense Association has called them a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.\\n\\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\\n\\nCompared with other states, Florida has some of the stricter accountability requirements for homeschooling families, whether they use the Gardiner or not. They include maintaining a portfolio of student work, which is subject to inspection at any time by the district superintendent, and submitting an annual evaluation of student work, which can take the form of a state test.\\n\\nThe Gardiner has an additional layer of review. Amy Graham is the senior policy director for Step Up For Students, the nonprofit which administers the Gardiner. The group's role includes verifying that the expenditures that parents submit actually serve educational needs. We've had a variety of things that have been denied, she says, such as toys or entertainment videos.\\n\\nI spoke with four families using the Gardiner, and all said it was working out better for them than conventional school. Ewan, 14, lives in Merritt Island on Florida's Space Coast. He has autism and a passion for science. But, he struggled to adjust to public school. He once walked out of his kindergarten class, crossing six lanes of traffic, intending to go home for lunch.\\n\\nThe worst part for him was the noise. I hate the sound of children being loud. I just want to rip my hair out, he says. His school tried to help, giving him headphones to amplify the teacher's voice and cancel out background sounds. But that made it even more difficult than it already was to connect with peers.\\n\\nBy sixth grade, Ewan was placed in a class with students who had significant cognitive challenges. But, he told his parents and his teachers in a meeting, I just want to learn what everyone else is learning. His parents took him out and enrolled him in Florida Virtual School, an online charter program. With the ability to study in peace and quiet, and rewind and re-watch lectures, his mother says his grades went from Fs and Cs to As and Bs within one marking period.\\n\\nAfter a few years, seeking even more customization, his parents applied for the Gardiner. Now Ewan makes his own schedule, attending astronomy lectures at nearby universities, studying German, sampling free online college courses and learning to take photographs and use his own telescope. He is blowing me away with some of the stuff he is understanding, says his mother, Alicia. And that is because of the Gardiner.\\n\\nThe Gardiner is not a good fit for every special-needs student. Alicia points out that $10,000 doesn't go a long way for students who might need speech, occupational or behavioral therapy on a daily or weekly basis, as Ewan did when he was younger. In Dorothy's case, her children's therapies are paid for by Medicaid, because she adopted them from medical foster care. But, a lot of parents who do have children with more complex needs are still left in limbo, Alicia says.\\n\\nAccepting the Gardiner prohibits families from double-dipping into services or even extracurricular activities provided at public schools, says Amy Graham at Step Up For Students. A cross-check is done to make sure they aren't enrolled in public school.\\n\\nAnd homeschooling is only an economic option in the first place for families in which at least one parent has a flexible schedule. Both Alicia and Dorothy work from home while supervising their teenagers.\\n\\nAs we pointed out previously in NPR Ed's school choice series, special-needs families who accept private school vouchers often give up their federal rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This includes the right to a Free Appropriate Public Education, or FAPE.\\n\\nThe same is true of the Gardiner, says Amy Graham. We have language in the Gardiner Scholarship law that says that by participating in the Gardiner Program you're not allowed to have FAPE. You're giving that up. The state will still evaluate students, but if families take them out of the system, they are no longer eligible for services.\\n\\nAlicia, Ewan's mother, says that's a choice that families shouldn't have to make. Florida is all about school choice, says Alicia. But it's only a choice where the choices are equally beneficial for a student. Otherwise we're being herded into a decision.\\n\\nStill, for families like Dorothy's and Alicia's, the tradeoff is worth it. So, too, for Tracy, a mother in Citrus County, Fla.\\n\\nTracy's son, now 17, has an autism diagnosis and loves computer programming. We had a long, long fight with the public schools before the Gardiner came out, she says. Often the behavioral plans weren't followed. [Other students] beat him up and threatened to kill him... The school took his assistive devices and gave them to other children.\\n\\nToday, Tracy says, he is studying video game design with the help of a high-speed computer and online courses, all paid for by the Gardiner."}
{"original": "Pentagon Considers Canceling Program That Recruits Immigrant Soldiers\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Pentagon is considering pulling out of a deal it made with thousands of noncitizen recruits with specialized skills: Join the military and we'll put you on the fast track to citizenship.\\n\\nThe proposal to dismantle the program would cancel enlistment contracts for many of the foreign-born recruits, leaving about 1,000 of them without legal protection from deportation.\\n\\nThe plan under consideration is laid out in a memo from Pentagon officials to Defense Secretary James Mattis. In the memo, obtained by NPR, high-level personnel and intelligence officials cite security concerns and inadequate vetting of recruits under a program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI.\\n\\nThe memo also cites the potential threat posed by individuals who may have a higher risk of connections to Foreign Intelligence Services, and it refers to an elevated risk of an insider threat.\\n\\nThe recruitment program began in 2009 to attract immigrants with medical or language skills, such as surgeons or Arabic speakers. It allows visa holders, asylees and refugees to bypass the green card process to become U.S. citizens.\\n\\nThe founder of the MAVNI program, retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, said the security concerns are overblown. If you were a bad guy who wanted to infiltrate the Army, you wouldn't risk the many levels of vetting required in this program, she said.\\n\\nNoncitizens have had a long history in the U.S. military. Immigrants have been eligible to enlist since the Revolutionary War.\\n\\nThree Defense Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the memo publicly, said the Pentagon is trying to balance national security concerns with the military's needs for specialized skills immigrants can provide. In some cases, the officials said, the Army wasn't using the program as intended, putting MAVNI recruits in roles that didn't match their skills.\\n\\nNearly 10,000 immigrants are in the MAVNI program, principally the Army, according to the Pentagon memo. The memo divides them into four groups based on their potential security risk, as determined by their level of vetting and their access to classified information.\\n\\nSome already are serving in the military and have been flagged for enhanced security screenings, while others are awaiting basic training and would be separated from the military or have their enlistment contracts canceled.\\n\\nAbout 1,000 of the recruits who have been awaiting naturalization would be at risk of deportation because their visas have expired. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had deferred action on deportation in these cases because the soldiers were in the MAVNI program.\\n\\nThe program has been frozen pending further review.\\n\\nQuestions about the program arose last year when officials discovered that some MAVNI recruits had offered false educational credentials, according to a legal brief from the Department of Justice. The brief was filed as part of a lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's decision to freeze the program.\\n\\nThe Pentagon responded to the discovery of some recruits providing fake university degrees by ordering security checks on all recruits in the program and barring new enlistments.\\n\\nBut that screening process has overwhelmed the Army's resources. According to the Pentagon memo, those security checks have diverted already constrained Army fiscal and manpower resources from their primary roles.\\n\\nStock said many MAVNI recruits were left in limbo.\\n\\nThe Army said you can ship to basic training after you complete the background checks. But now they've canceled all the background checks so nobody can ship to basic training, she said.\\n\\nIn one of two ongoing lawsuits, several noncitizens recruited under MAVNI and serving in the Army Reserve have sued. They argue that they were promised an expedited path to citizenship but that the Department of Homeland Security, at the behest of the Pentagon, has failed to process their naturalization applications, as required by law.\\n\\nIn the other case, the plaintiffs argue the Pentagon discriminated against naturalized U.S. citizens who were denied security clearances in the first terms of their enlistment. That meant that the military careers of the MAVNI recruits were effectively stalled out because they were unable to attend officer training school, for instance.\\n\\nThe lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, Kirti Tiwari, is a native of India, with a master's degree in molecular biology. He was selected as an Army nominee for NASA's astronaut program, but that plan was put on hold when Tiwari couldn't get a security clearance in his first term of enlistment.\\n\\nThe Pentagon has since changed that policy, but plaintiffs' attorney Neil T. O'Donnell said naturalized citizen soldiers still face discrimination because some haven't been allowed to enter basic training.\\n\\nIn the memo, the Pentagon acknowledges that freezing the MAVNI program and subjecting recruits to more screening could be legally problematic. For example, some of the recruits are already naturalized citizens who have been deployed around the globe. There are significant legal constraints to subjecting this population to enhanced screening without an individualized assessment of cause, the memo states.\\n\\nThe memo also suggests devising a public affairs strategy before canceling enlistment contracts.\\n\\nStock, the founder of the program, said the proposal outlined in the memo could be a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\\n\\nThey're subjecting this whole entire group of people to this extreme vetting, and it's not based on any individual suspicion of any of these people. They've passed all kinds of security checks already. That in itself is unconstitutional, she said."}
{"original": "Pompeo Won't Say Whether He Owes Yovanovitch An Apology. 'I've Done What's Right'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nUpdated on Saturday at 3:01 p.m.\\n\\nWith the State Department facing continued questions over the treatment of Marie Yovanovitch before she was recalled as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would not say on Friday whether he owed the career diplomat an apology.\\n\\nI've defended every single person on this team, Pompeo said in an interview with NPR. I've done what's right for every single person on this team.\\n\\nPressed on whether he could point to specific remarks in which he defended Yovanovitch, Pompeo responded, I've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.\\n\\nThe exchange with Mary Louise Kelly, co-host of All Things Considered, follows the release by House Democrats last week of messages suggesting that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance in the days before she was told to return to Washington from her posting in Kyiv last year.\\n\\nThe messages were sent between Robert Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate and fervent Trump supporter, and Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. He was indicted in October on campaign finance charges.\\n\\nParnas has emerged as a central figure in efforts by Giuliani to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate political rivals of Trump. That campaign is now the focus of the ongoing impeachment trial against Trump in the Senate.\\n\\nPossible surveillance of a U.S. ambassador\\n\\nThe State Department itself is now investigating the possible surveillance of Yovanovitch, who during testimony before House impeachment investigators in November said she had felt threatened by Trump. Before her recall, Yovanovitch had been accused of disloyalty by allies of the White House, and during his now-infamous July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said of Yovanovitch, She's going to go through some things.\\n\\nIn an interview last week with the conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, Pompeo said he never heard that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance. In her testimony before the House, Yovanovitch said she was told by the State Department that she was being recalled because of concerns about her security.\\n\\nPompeo has come under criticism — including, at times, from career diplomats in his own department — for failing to more forcefully defend Yovanovitch in the face of political attacks. During testimony before impeachment investigators, for example, Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, said he resigned from the department in part over what he interpreted to be a lack of public support for Department employees.\\n\\nI'm not going to comment on things that Mr. McKinley may have said, Pompeo said on Friday. But he dismissed the suggestion that a shadow foreign policy involving Ukraine was in place.\\n\\nThe Ukraine policy has been run from the Department of State for the entire time that I have been here, and our policy was very clear, Pompeo said.\\n\\nImmediately after the questions on Ukraine, the interview concluded. Pompeo stood, leaned in and silently glared at Kelly for several seconds before leaving the room.\\n\\nA few moments later, an aide asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo's private living room at the State Department without a recorder. The aide did not say the ensuing exchange would be off the record.\\n\\nInside the room, Pompeo shouted his displeasure at being questioned about Ukraine and asked Kelly to identify the country on a map, which she did. He used repeated expletives, according to Kelly, and asked, Do you think Americans care about Ukraine? He then said, People will hear about this.\\n\\nIn a statement Saturday, Pompeo disputed NPR's account of the interaction.\\n\\nNPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record, he said. It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine.\\n\\nIn a statement, NPR Senior Vice President for News Nancy Barnes said, Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.\\n\\nThe U.S. and Iran\\n\\nThe interview began with a series of questions about the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. Pompeo defended the president's maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, saying it is absolutely working.\\n\\nThis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. And the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program, Pompeo said in reference to the international agreement signed by Iran, the U.S., the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in 2015. It was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off.\\n\\nAs the nation's chief diplomat, Pompeo has played a central role in shaping the president's more aggressive posture toward Iran. It's a policy Pompeo has described as reestablishing deterrence.\\n\\nThe policy has taken many forms. Less than two weeks after Pompeo was sworn in as secretary of state in 2018, Trump announced the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. The announcement was followed by the reinstatement of steep economic sanctions against Tehran.\\n\\nUnder Pompeo, the State Department has also designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time the U.S. has given that label to the branch of another government.\\n\\nYet perhaps no action has been more controversial than the administration's decision this month to launch the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's influential Quds Force, outside the airport in Baghdad. While the administration has declined to offer specifics about the intelligence that prompted the strike, Pompeo has defended the president's order, saying it was carried out in response to an imminent threat of attack on U.S. embassies.\\n\\nFor days, the killing revived fears of an all-out war. Iran retaliated with strikes against two bases housing American troops in Iraq. No Americans died in the attack, though the U.S. military later revealed that 34 service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries.\\n\\nTensions have since eased, but the episode has renewed questions about whether the president's maximum pressure campaign has emboldened Tehran. Since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, Iran has shot down a U.S. drone, targeted oil tankers in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, and been blamed for a debilitating attack on Saudi oil facilities.\\n\\nAt the same time, Iran has stepped away from key provisions of the nuclear deal. In an interview this month with NPR, the country's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said all limits on centrifuges used to enrich uranium are now suspended.\\n\\nHe's blustering, Pompeo said in Friday's interview. This is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today.\\n\\nThe secretary declined, however, to detail specifics of the administration's policy for preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, saying only, We'll stop them.\\n\\nPompeo would not say whether direct U.S. engagement is taking place with Iran but did say the administration has built a coalition that's working to put pressure on Iran to end its missile program, its processing of uranium and the reprocessing of plutonium.\\n\\nHe said the U.S. has also raised the cost for Iran's use of force through proxy groups in the Middle East.\\n\\nThis is beginning to place real choices in front of the Iranian regime, Pompeo said. You can see in the protests inside of Iran. You can see the Iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. All the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the American people are coming to fruition as a direct result of President Trump's strategy.\\n\\nHe would not comment on whether a new deal is being developed in order to prevent Tehran from acquiring a weapon, but instead said, The economic, military and diplomatic deterrence that we have put in place will deliver that outcome.\\n\\nThe Iranian leadership will have to make the decision about what its behavior is going to be, he said."}
{"original": "Despite Huge Backlogs, The Government Shutdown Halts Most Immigration Court Hearings\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP\\n\\nThe federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.\\n\\nCourt appointments scheduled during the shutdown will be reset to new dates in the future, per a notice from the Department of Justice dated Dec. 26. The only exception are courts operating in immigration detention centers, where federal immigration authorities hold immigrants pending deportation. However, court staff may not be paid while continuing to hear those cases.\\n\\nIn addition, some emergency motions in nondetained cases can still be filed to the judges that are working during the shutdown.\\n\\nShutting down the country's massive system of immigration courts will gum up an already congested judicial process, immigration judges and attorneys say.\\n\\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled.\\n\\nIn federal immigration court, judges often hear cases in quick succession, a process some have compared to hearing death penalty cases heard in traffic court settings. A swift deportation may become a death sentence if a person is forced to return to a violent homeland.\\n\\nEach day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in Los Angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.\\n\\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled, she said.\\n\\nCalls to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.\\n\\nIn recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the U.S. has swelled, as processing times lagged. The average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles statistics on U.S. immigration. That's up from 430 days a decade ago.\\n\\nSome administration officials and immigration hard-liners have criticized long processing times as contributing to practices that allow immigrants without strong cases to stay in the U.S. for years, rather than be swiftly deported.\\n\\nTo try to move cases through more quickly, the Trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. However, under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. If reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.\\n\\nBoth policies drew criticism from judges such as Tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.\\n\\nIt's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration, she said, referring to President Trump's desire for funding additional barriers at U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nIt's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.\\n\\nRescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. For others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise, said Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz.\\n\\nFor example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. Or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the U.S. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.\\n\\nEvery immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said Philadelphia immigration attorney Matthew Archambeault. In either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.\\n\\nThe thing I tell them is, something's going on, their hearings may not go forward, but to prepare like they're going to go forward, said Archambeault. I don't get into it too much."}
{"original": "COVID-19 Supply Deal Lets Vaccine Maker Earmark Doses For Employees And Their Families\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images\\n\\nAs the nation grapples with a slower-than-promised coronavirus vaccine rollout, one federal deal to increase factory capacity includes an unusual condition: the manufacturer would be allowed to earmark doses to vaccinate employees and their families, giving them an opportunity to skip the line that public health policymakers have been crafting for months.\\n\\nOperation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's push to make a COVID-19 vaccine available in record time, added $628 million to a federal contract with Emergent BioSolutions, a Maryland-based contract manufacturer, to advance manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine as well as therapeutics, the Department of Health and Human Services announced in June.\\n\\nThe company has also inked separate deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine doses for AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, all three of which are part of Operation Warp Speed.\\n\\nAccording to Emergent's federal contract, the company can keep a reasonable quantity of vaccines to inoculate its employees and critical subcontractors, and their respective immediate families.\\n\\nIt's a unique and ethically fraught clause that doesn't appear in any of the other Operation Warp Speed contracts NPR has reviewed. Although the contract doesn't explicitly state that the company will vaccinate its workers ahead of people at higher risk of COVID-19, it could have that effect. And extending vaccination to family members heightened concerns that the provision would mean delays for other people prioritized for immunization.\\n\\nWhile vaccine manufacturers are no doubt essential, placing their workers in the highest risk group and allowing their families to get the vaccine at the same time they do is problematic, says bioethicist Ruth Faden, the founding director of the Berman Institute for Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University. She is also a member of the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts' Working Group on COVID-19 vaccines.\\n\\nI am unaware of any context in which the family members of a critical class of workers have been included along with that critical class, Faden says. So let's take our health workers, right? Have you heard any discussion that immediate family members of even frontline health workers should get vaccines?\\n\\nIt's a rhetorical question.\\n\\nI haven't ... and that's because it doesn't pass an ethics smell test — as much as my heart breaks for the family members of health workers who have had to worry about what their loved ones are risking, she says. There are many more people at greater risk, for whom a stronger ethical case can be made.\\n\\nThere's a limit on how many doses Emergent can retain, but it's been redacted from the document. The contract says the company will also have to pay for the doses.\\n\\nWhen asked about the clause, the federal government and Emergent say company employees and their families won't get to cut in front of other people in line for the vaccine.\\n\\nVaccine manufacturers should coordinate with their state for any prioritization, according to the state's plans, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told NPR in an email. The HHS spokesperson didn't answer our question about how this part of the Operation Warp Speed contract came about.\\n\\nIt is expected that Emergent's employees will receive COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with the vaccine distribution plans of the states in which they reside, says Emergent spokesperson Nina DeLorenzo.\\n\\nThe company didn't answer NPR's follow-up question: If that's so, what's the point of the clause in the contract at all? Emergent's response was a restatement of the previous answer.\\n\\nBased on a review of the contract clause, Ameet Sarpatwari, assistant director of Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law, says it is intended to allow employees and their family members to get vaccinated when the company wants, regardless of public health officials' vaccine rollout queue.\\n\\nThe only reason that clause is in there is that they considered the possibility of jumping the queue and it allows them the option of doing so, he says, adding that Emergent's insistence that it intends for its employees to wait their turn doesn't mean much.\\n\\nI think the federal government did a disservice to the public at large, many of whom are wondering when they are going to get their vaccine and in some cases if they are going to get the vaccine by agreeing to this clause, he says.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices worked throughout 2020 to hammer out recommendations for who should get the COVID-19 vaccine and when. The CDC recommends prioritizing health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities before vaccinating front line essential workers like firefighters, for example. States then made their own plans based on the CDC's guidance.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration said that states should immediately make COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone 65 and older as well as people with health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. That's a change over previous recommendations to prioritize certain essential workers and people over 75 years old in the next phase of vaccination.\\n\\nSarpatwari says companies shouldn't be able to use their contracts to jump ahead in the queue policymakers designed because the decision as to who gets this scarce resource is already so ethically fraught.\\n\\nEvery dose matters right now, and we're trying to get them into the hands or into the arms of the people who need it the most, he says. And there's not a strong case that these are the people who need it the most.\\n\\nEmergent isn't the only vaccine maker that has looked at ways for its staff and their families to get access to shots.\\n\\nModerna has a different plan for immunizing a range of employees and affiliates, though it doesn't appear in the company's Operation Warp Speed contract.\\n\\nModerna announced Dec. 29 that it would be vaccinating board members, employees, contractors and their adult household members to provide an additional layer of COVID-19 protection and to reduce the risk of absenteeism and disruption due to a COVID-19 infection in an adult household member. Participating is voluntary, paid for by Moderna and separate from the 200 million doses the federal government has already agreed to purchase.\\n\\nFor transparency, the Company notified appropriate health authorities about the program in advance and is participating in all relevant monitoring and reporting obligations under the Emergency Use Authorization, Moderna said in a press release.\\n\\nModerna employees will sidestep state vaccine prioritization plans. But instead of cutting the line, the company is creating its own separate line with a small number of additional doses not available to the general public.\\n\\nThe supply is in addition to the commitments to the US, so the supply actually increases the capacity and number of individuals in [the] US who can be vaccinated, and in effect speeds up vaccination for those not in Moderna's program, Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan told NPR.\\n\\nPublic Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, first told NPR about the clause in Emergent's contract. Zain Rizvi, a law and policy researcher focused on pharmaceuticals at the organization has been combing through the Operation Warp Speed contracts for months. This one was posted as part of an Emergent financial filing. Others have been harder to come by because the federal government has been slow to respond to public records requests.\\n\\nIt just raises questions about the government deal-making process and what information the government is actually disclosing to the public as well, Rizvi says. I think it's a perfect example of why the government needs to be much more transparent when it comes to the terms of its deals with these giant pharmaceutical corporations.\\n\\nYou can contact NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin at slupkin@npr.org."}
{"original": "Omissions On Death Certificates Lead To Undercounting Of Opioid Overdoses\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media\\n\\nIn a refrigerator in the coroner's office in Marion County, Ind., rows of vials await testing. They contain blood, urine and vitreous, the fluid collected from inside a human eye.\\n\\nIn overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.\\n\\nWe send that off to a toxicology lab to be tested for what we call drugs of abuse, said Alfie Ballew, deputy coroner. The results often include drugs such as cocaine, heroin, fentanyl or prescription pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nAfter testing, coroners typically write the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate — but not always.\\n\\nStandards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. As a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. The country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in February in the journal Addiction.\\n\\nWe have a real crisis, and one of the things we need to invest in, if we're going to make progress, is getting better information, said Christopher Ruhm, the author of the paper and a health economist at the University of Virginia.\\n\\nData from death certificates move from coroners and medical examiners to states and eventually the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes reports on overdose counts across the U.S. According to the CDC, more than 42,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2016, a 30 percent increase from the year before.\\n\\nBut that number is only as good as the data states submit to the CDC. Ruhm said the real number of opioid overdose deaths is closer to 50,000. He came to the higher estimate through an analysis of overdoses that weren't linked to specific drugs.\\n\\nOn a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. In some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said Ruhm. In the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.\\n\\nSome states do worse than others. In 14 states, between 20 and 48 percent of all overdose deaths weren't attributed to specific drugs in 2016, according to a breakdown from FiveThirtyEight.\\n\\nMany overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, Ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. According to Ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, Indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. He estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.\\n\\nIn some states such as Indiana, independent county coroners investigate deaths. Coroners are usually elected, and they aren't necessarily medical professionals. Other states, though, have medical examiners, who are doctors. Some even have a chief medical examiner who oversees death investigations for the whole state.\\n\\nStates that have centralized oversight with medical examiners tend to do better than those with coroners, said Ruhm.\\n\\nIn some places, death investigators don't list substances on a death certificate because they haven't tested for them. Brad Ray, a policy researcher at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said toxicology reports cost hundreds of dollars each, which could strain county budgets.\\n\\nAdditionally, toxicology reports are currently optional for Indiana coroners. So if you're not required to pay for it, and you're not required to report it, why would you? said Ray.\\n\\nIndiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and Gov. Eric Holcomb is expected to sign it. Starting in July, coroners will have to run toxicology screens and report the results to the state health department. The state will also help cover the added costs.\\n\\nMore accurate data will likely make the opioid problem look worse as the numbers go up. But Ray said realistic data could help the state access federal funds to tackle the opioid epidemic and keep better track of drug problems.\\n\\nSo we can see when trends are happening. We can see when there tend to be increases in cocaine and meth and decreases in opioids, if that happens, said Ray.\\n\\nMarion County's Ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. Her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.\\n\\nWe'll say 'drug overdose' or 'drug intoxication,' and then we identify the drugs, she said. So if it's five drugs that have caused or contributed to the death, then we put those five drugs down.\\n\\nBallew plans to travel the state and train other coroners to do it the same way.\\n\\nThis story was produced by Side Effects Public Media, a reporting collaborative focused on public health, in partnership with NPR and Kaiser Health News.

{"original": "Biden's Plan To Release More Vaccine Is A Gamble. Is It Worth The Risk?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is planning to take a dramatic step aimed at increasing the amount of vaccine available to states.\\n\\nHis transition team says he'll change a Trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.\\n\\nInstead, the Biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. For people who've gotten initial shots, the Biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.\\n\\nThe two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.\\n\\nAccording to CDC, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.\\n\\nThe President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.\\n\\nSome public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health — who advises both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration on the federal COVID-19 response — tells NPR there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.\\n\\nThe Biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. They are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. They feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.\\n\\nThe Biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.\\n\\nWe have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, Biden's incoming press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing Friday. The president-elect has said he will use the Defense Production Act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.\\n\\nHowever, Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the Trump administration, defends its current policy.\\n\\nIf President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.\\n\\nA key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.\\n\\nThe head of the Association of Immunization Managers, Claire Hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. The goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. Get it, thaw it, give it. [Then] order the second dose. Don't try to store it at CDC, don't try to store it at McKesson.\\n\\nMarc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that this is a good move. He says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.\\n\\nAs the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, Lipsitch says.\\n\\nThere is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. This is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.\\n\\nThe danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. It could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.\\n\\nRasmussen and others worry that a weak immune response could actually lead to the virus developing new mutations that are even more dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement earlier this week confirming the importance of the booster shots.\\n\\nBut many approve of the Biden policy announced Friday.\\n\\nThis strategy makes tons of sense, Dr. Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco wrote in an email to NPR. We know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.\\n\\nDr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials or ASTHO, calls the Biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. The big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.\\n\\nOur hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.\\n\\nIf it turns out there are production issues down the line, the Biden decision could be reversed, suggests Julie Swann, a supply chain expert and professor at North Carolina State University.\\n\\nI think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [If] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.\\n\\nPien Huang contributed to this report."}
{"original": "6 Takeaways From President Biden's Inauguration\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Biden.\\n\\nThat's going to take some getting used to after these past four years.\\n\\nThe new president was sworn in Wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. Biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing Americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the U.S. faces, as he sees it.\\n\\nHere are six takeaways from Biden's inauguration:\\n\\n1. A starkly different tone was set.\\n\\nIf there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that Biden struck. Gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of Donald Trump. Instead, America saw a staid and humble President Biden. Instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.\\n\\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, Biden said. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.\\n\\nFor a significant portion of the country, Biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the Trump presidency. Some Republicans even praised his speech. For another large group of Americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.\\n\\nOverall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to COVID-19 and threats, it seemed like Washington was headed for something of a return to normal.\\n\\nFor a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the U.S. Capitol on the first three Wednesdays of this January: one of the Jan. 6 violence, one of Trump's impeachment and then one of Biden's inauguration.\\n\\n2. Real unity will be tough to come by.\\n\\nTrying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, Biden did something Trump rarely did — reach out to those who didn't vote for him. And he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all.\\n\\nTo all those who did not support us, Biden said, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\\n\\nCertainly, this was no Trump American carnage speech. But tone is one thing, and policy is another.\\n\\nA return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but only very narrowly. Biden will likely need Republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.\\n\\nAnd it won't solve the problem of the tens of millions of Trump supporters who are fed and believe a daily diet of false information — and who make up the base of the Republican Party.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\n3. Biden laid out his priorities.\\n\\nSpeaking of those priorities, Biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in America. They include addressing COVID-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. He is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address.\\n\\nBiden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. But you can bet that Republicans will find plenty to disagree with Democrats about in how to solve those issues. And what of unity then? More importantly, what of solving those issues when Biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of Republican opposition?\\n\\nBiden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more.\\n\\nBut there's only so far those executive orders can go.\\n\\n4. Truth matters again.\\n\\nWhen hearing of Trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many Trump supporters dismissed the criticism that Trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: Oh, come on. All politicians lie.\\n\\nWell, not like what was seen these past four years. Trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to The Washington Post. That's an average of 20 per day.\\n\\nWhat usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. Then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. But Trump could not be shamed.\\n\\nThe news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. And Biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. But there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.\\n\\n5. Inaugurations may have changed permanently.\\n\\nBiden got out of the presidential limo and walked hand in hand with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, to the White House. For a brief moment, in a tight shot on television, it could have all looked like any other inauguration.\\n\\nBut it was not. The walk was drastically curtailed and more heavily guarded compared with past presidential inaugurations. And while there were some people on the street during the walk, there weren't throngs of people lining the streets.\\n\\nIt's very likely that inaugurations as we knew them have changed permanently. There may be a return of people to the National Mall and even a parade when the coronavirus pandemic finally clears.\\n\\nBut from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events.\\n\\n6. The presidency is overwhelming — for anyone.\\n\\nDespite his decades serving as a senator in Washington and even his eight years as vice president, Biden was clearly moved by the reality of his new position.\\n\\nTrump even appeared cowed Wednesday by leaving it. On Trump's exit from the White House, he stopped to talk to reporters. He looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind — and even thanked the media.\\n\\nAfter walking up to the White House, Biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. He then hugged his wife and held the embrace. They took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years."}
{"original": "Gov. Wolf just set a lofty climate goal. What will it take to get there?\\n\\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\\n\\nGov. Tom Wolf kicked off the new year with an ambitious climate change goal: reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.\\n\\nPennsylvania is the nation's fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. If cutting emissions to arrive at Wolf's targets is achievable, it will require a host of strategies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne involves far more electric vehicles on the road. In the Pittsburgh area, less than 1 percent of car sales are electric, said Sarah Olexsak, manager of transportation electrification for Duquesne Light.\\n\\nThe power utility began greening its own fleet in 2017, purchasing electric sedans and trucks to use in lieu of ones powered by gasoline or diesel.\\n\\nStanding next to one of the electric trucks recently, Olexsak paused to listen to a faint stream of white noise emanating from it.\\n\\nThis is all you're going to hear, the sound of the fan and the batteries, she said.\\n\\nThat's less of a nuisance for residents when workers are fixing nearby lines. Plus, there are zero tailpipe emissions.\\n\\nDuquesne Light is also working with parking authorities and local businesses to help install chargers for the public, offering guidance on where to place them and whether to require payment for their use.\\n\\nYour car is going to sit eight-plus hours a day at a work site, Olexsak said. It's a great place to charge up.\\n\\nBetter planning and incentives to increase electric vehicle use would result in significant greenhouse gas reductions for Pennsylvania. That's one suggestion for cutting emissions included in the state's most recent blueprint for addressing climate change, the draft of its Climate Action Plan released by the Department of Environmental Protection every three years.\\n\\nWolf based his new climate goals off models identified in the plan, which use 2005 as a baseline year for emission levels. As coal-fired power plants shut down amid competition from cleaner natural gas and renewables, Pennsylvania is already halfway to his 2025 target.\\n\\nMaking that goal is feasible, said Carnegie Mellon University professor Jay Apt, a director of the school's electric industry center.\\n\\nWolf has joined other governors in setting similar short- and long-range targets.\\n\\nThe idea of having a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2050 will inform choices that we make now because energy investments are very long-lived, Apt said.\\n\\nA gas power plant, for example, will operate for decades.\\n\\nThat's a big shadow that an investment today casts, Apt said. Having a goal now that articulates out 30 years into the future is quite reasonable.\\n\\nMany in the environmental community were glad to see the governor set ambitious targets.\\n\\nIt's absolutely the goal we need, but the market by itself is not going to get us there. We really need to do it through policy, said Mark Szybist, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\\n\\nEstablishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a limit on emissions is one option. The state could also boost its Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, a law that requires a certain percentage of the state's power mix come from renewables. Those ideas will be tough to get through a Republican-led Legislature.\\n\\nLawmakers this year are expected to debate whether to rescue the state's nuclear industry. Like coal, it's struggling to compete with gas and renewables. Nuclear reactors provide Pennsylvania's largest source of carbon-free power, but several are slated to close prematurely.\\n\\nKeeping those nuclear power plants operating as they are now is a very good low-pollution strategy, Apt said.\\n\\nIn announcing his climate goals, Wolf did not say if he would support such a plan. He did indicate he wants to go after more natural gas development while striving for lower emissions.\\n\\nSzybist with the NRDC said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. Gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.\\n\\nThe emission reductions we've seen the past few years, I think are not durable, Szybist said. They're vulnerable to going back up again unless we figure out energy policy that will really drive development of renewables.\\n\\nThe state has made progress on some policy fronts, joining a group of states developing a clean transportation policy, cracking down on methane leaks and releasing a plan for greater solar energy development.\\n\\nPolicy is most important to drive all this, but businesses and citizens can step up as well, Szybist said.\\n\\nDEP's draft climate action plan, which is expected to be finalized soon, accounts for what further action the state could take. It includes policies tied to nuclear, renewables, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and more options for emission reductions.\\n\\nYou're not going to reach the goal with just these strategies, said Robert Graff of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, who's also a member of the state's climate change advisory committee.\\n\\nThey only get Pennsylvania halfway to its 2050 target. But, he said, the plan is a starting point. He said he believes the governor's decision to announce those goals will get people to give the plan more consideration. The state received a federal grant to help develop it, and Graff said it's more thorough than in previous years.\\n\\nMaybe, technological advances in energy storage or capturing and storing carbon emissions will make an 80 percent drop easier to achieve, he said. It's also possible that at some point, the federal government could step in with sweeping policies aimed at reducing emissions, or that the public will become more willing to change carbon-intense habits by driving or flying less, for example.\\n\\nYou have to walk a narrow path between what's effective and what's economically feasible and also what will have less disruption to the way people like to live, Graff said.\\n\\nEditor's Picks"}
{"original": "After Mass Shootings, Action On Gun Legislation Soars At State Level\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\\n\\nThere's an all-too familiar fight that takes place after horrible events like those in Dallas and Orlando, centered around firearms and how — or even whether — to regulate them.\\n\\nGun-control advocates and Democrats call for tighter regulations. Gun-rights groups and Republicans argue that blame shouldn't be put on inanimate objects, but on the people pulling the trigger. Both sides dig in. And it seems that nothing changes.\\n\\nA frustrated Dallas Police Chief David Brown challenged federal lawmakers to debate gun control earlier this week, saying, Do your job. We're doing ours.\\n\\nState Vs. Federal\\n\\nWhile it's true that Congress has failed to pass new gun laws after mass shootings, despite Democrat-staged sit-ins, presidential pleas and other vocal efforts, the sense that nothing changes is wrong. At the state level, a lot changes in terms of laws.\\n\\nMore than 20,400 pieces of gun-related legislation have been proposed following mass shooting events in the past 25 years. Of those bills, more than 3,000 have become law, according to a working paper recently released by researchers at the Harvard Business School.\\n\\nIt's not that nothing changes after a mass shooting, says Deepak Malhotra, one of the paper's authors. A lot of the action on [gun control] happens across states instead of at the federal level.\\n\\nThe researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation — whether it tightens or loosens gun laws — depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.\\n\\nIf you have a Republican legislature in your state and you have a mass shooting, the net effect if you look at the actual bills that get passed is there's a significant increase in bills that loosen gun restrictions, Malhotra says.\\n\\nDemocrat-controlled states showed no such effect. Bills that tightened gun regulations did get proposed after mass shootings, just not at a noticeably higher rate.\\n\\nA good example of this is California, where the state's governor recently signed six gun-control bills into law, many of which were in response to the shooting in San Bernardino, where 14 people were killed.\\n\\nWe've covered a large spectrum when it comes to gun safety measures, says state Sen. Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, from high-capacity cartridges to domestic violence and temporary restraining orders.\\n\\nSix gun laws sounds like a lot, but for comparison, California passed 11 gun-related laws in 2013 and approved four others in 2014. It's not unusual for the deeply blue state to pass a number of laws tightening restrictions on firearms in a given year.\\n\\n'Instruments Of Defense'\\n\\nRepublican-controlled states are different. Gun-related legislation doesn't come up as often as it does in Democrat-led states, and when it does, the aim often isn't to tighten regulations, but to loosen them.\\n\\nTake Tennessee: Last July, a gunman killed four people and injured three more at a military recruiting station and a Navy building in Chattanooga — two places that were gun-free zones for everyone except police.\\n\\n[The shooting] confirmed even more the idea that gun-free zones left those servicemen and women as literally sitting ducks, says state Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden.\\n\\nIn response, the state has since approved five bills related to guns, including one sponsored by Holt that allows full-time employees of public universities to carry handguns on campuses, where guns were previously banned.\\n\\nWhen we put instruments of defense in the hands of law-abiding citizens, in my opinion, I think we see a decrease in criminal statistics, Holt says.\\n\\nSimilar opinions have been voiced in Florida, another Republican-controlled state, since the Orlando shooting. Nightclubs like Pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. At least one Republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in Florida.\\n\\nDemocrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists — similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.\\n\\nCertainly, it's not going to be an easy vote to win, says state Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando. But we put something forward that I believe is narrowly tailored for both parties to get behind.\\n\\nIt's hard to predict how the Republican-led legislatures in Florida and Texas will respond to the recent shootings. The scale of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. And the fact that the five victims of the Dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.\\n\\nIf history is any indicator, though, it's likely that both states will pass gun-related legislation in the coming year."}
{"original": "Trump Administration Proposes Major Changes To Bedrock Environmental Law\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Mone/AP Jim Mone/AP\\n\\nUpdated at 1:40 E.T.\\n\\nIn one of his most sweeping environmental proposals so far, President Trump says he wants to streamline an outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process that can delay major infrastructure projects for years.\\n\\nSupporters from the fossil fuel, construction, ranching and other industries welcome the move, which they've long sought. Environmental groups warn it would sideline the climate impacts of highways, pipelines and other projects, and they promise a legal challenge.\\n\\nThe proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which has not been updated in decades. As one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. It also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.\\n\\nAmerica is a nation of builders, Trump said announcing the move at the White House, whose gleaming new infrastructure used to be the envy of the world. Now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the U.S. like a Third World country. It's really sad.\\n\\nA key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country.\\n\\nUnder the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. That could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.\\n\\nEnvironmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.\\n\\nMary Neumayr, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.\\n\\nThis delay, she says, deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families.\\n\\nIndustry groups say streamlining NEPA regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. In a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.\\n\\nEnvironmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.\\n\\nThe proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to NEPA review. For example, it would exempt non-federal projects with little government funding.\\n\\nIn another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.\\n\\nThis is a clearly a conflict of interest, says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president at Center for American Progress. She was a managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration.\\n\\nIt's baffling that the Trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster, says Goldfuss.\\n\\nThe White House CEQ will collect public comments for at least 60 days before making the rule final. But there are hurdles that could keep it from taking effect.\\n\\nFor one thing, if Trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. Even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. And experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.\\n\\nThe law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,'  says Bruce Huber of Notre Dame Law School. If the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law."}
{"original": "A Former Immigration Judge On The Current Situation\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nThe Trump administration zero tolerance policy has increased an already enormous backlog of cases for the nation's immigration courts. There are currently more than 700,000 cases pending. Paul Wickham Schmidt was an immigration judge for 13 years. He retired in 2016. Judge Schmidt joins us now. Thanks for being with us.\\n\\nPAUL SCHMIDT: It's my pleasure, Scott.\\n\\nSIMON: Is the immigration court system up to handling even more cases?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: No, they're not even up to handling the ones they have now.\\n\\nSIMON: Well, help us understand that. How long does it take, for example, for a case to work its way through the courts?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Well, when I retired, I was setting cases on the last day - I was on the bench June 30 of 2016. I think I was setting them for the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. I've heard they have more judges now, so maybe they've brought some of that in. But I think it's probably still 2020, 2021.\\n\\nSIMON: And why?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Well, there's too many cases and not enough judges. And the dockets have been mismanaged by the Department of Justice over the last three administrations - something I call aimless docket reshuffling.\\n\\nSIMON: What's that?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. And therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. And the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. So some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. And, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. But sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. So that disrupts dockets.\\n\\nSIMON: President Trump rejected a call for more immigration judges this week. He said, quote, we don't want judges. We want security on the border. How do you react?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Well, I don't think he understands the law and the constitution. According to the Supreme Court, everybody in the United States, regardless of status, has a right to due process under law. And you're not going to get due process from more border patrol agents. You're going to have to get judges of some type - give individuals fair hearings before an impartial decision-maker.\\n\\nSIMON: So the piercing cries of children that so many of us heard this week - those youngsters might not have the cases of their parents heard for - what? - two, three, four more years?\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Well, that is if they could get out of detention. But, of course, the administration has announced that they're going to detain 100 percent of the new arrivals who cross at a place other than a port of entry. And they're going to expedite their cases. In fact, the president, as part of his executive order, ordered a new round of aimless docket reshuffling, which means those cases will go to the top of the front of the line. Other cases that are ready to be heard will go to the back of the line. And judges that are handling dockets here and in other places will, in all likelihood, be moved to the border to hear these cases leaving nobody to hear the cases on their dockets - in Arlington, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, wherever they regularly sit. So it will be a total mess in my view.\\n\\nSIMON: Retired Immigration Judge Paul Wickham Schmidt, thanks so much.\\n\\nSCHMIDT: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nThey say in the primary, vote with your heart. And I like Elizabeth Warren's ideas the best, he said. But it's tough, because I think Joe Biden has the best chance of winning in 2020. I think sometimes he does struggle to connect with younger voters.\\n\\nRoss Benjamin, 30, traveled here this morning from just across the border in Wisconsin. He's planning to vote for Biden because he thinks Biden has the best shot to win over moderates and Republicans. But Benjamin says if he weren't worried about all that, he'd rather pick Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who last night packed an arena for a partylike rally featuring the band Vampire Weekend.\\n\\nI've seen both Warren and Bernie, and they really bring the energizing core to our generation, he said. If it wasn't about electability, it would be one of them two. I want someone who can actually get Donald Trump out of office, so I guess I'm sacrificing self-interest for the bigger picture.\\n\\nPeter Jarka-Sellers, 23, drove down from Minnesota last night to see Biden. He describes Biden as a good, decent guy whose life experiences really resonate with him. And he thinks Biden's policy platform is more realistic.\\n\\nWe're not going to get to do any of the things we want to do if [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is blocking them, and I think Biden will help us pick up some of the key Senate seats, so I'm trying to think how we can get the most done, he said. All of these people are saying stuff that's further than Congress will let them do. You're not going to get more than a public option [on health care].\\n\\nTucker LaBelle, a sophomore at Clarke, says he used to swing Republican and now is undecided between Sanders, 78, and Biden.\\n\\nA lot of people will say we need someone younger in the White House, but with the experience and history they have, it's kind of a no-brainer. They're legends, he said. I just like Bernie a little more over Biden because of the way he handles himself in public. I'm a communications major, and I focus on how people speak, and at that last debate especially, I saw a lot more personality out of Bernie.\\n\\nAt campaign events, Biden has heavily featured freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer as a surrogate, who in 2018 flipped a Republican district here in eastern Iowa at age 29.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Iowa, it is about the future of our state as well, not just our country, Finkenauer told NPR in an interview after the event. And making sure we have somebody like Joe who embodies the values I grew up with here in Iowa, where you care about your neighbors and you step up for folks, and you also get things done. And that matters — I don't care what generation you are. To see somebody who has done that his entire career, who has worked for working families, and that means everything to me, and that's what we've been talking about on the trail."}
{"original": "CEOs' Dilemma: Supporting Trump's Agenda, Opposing His Behavior\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\\n\\nUnder Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank set off a social media firestorm last February when he voiced some overly positive words about the new administration of President Trump.\\n\\nTo have such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset for this country. I think people should really grab that opportunity, said Plank, whose company makes sports apparel.\\n\\nOn Monday, Plank became the latest corporate CEO to publicly cut ties with the president, giving up his seat on a White House advisory council on manufacturing amid criticism over the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.\\n\\nThere is no place for racism or discrimination in this world, Plank said in a tweet.\\n\\nOthers quitting the council are Merck's Kenneth Frazier and Intel's Brian Krzanich. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry group, also announced his departure Tuesday, tweeting, I'm resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it's the right thing for me to do.\\n\\nAnd AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka also stepped down from the council.\\n\\nI think these leaders are waking up to the fact their continued silence in the face of mounting evidence of immorality is tantamount to consent, said Nicholas Pearce, clinical associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\\n\\nThe departures underscore the dilemma facing corporate chief executives at a highly polarized and partisan time, said David Ulrich, professor of business at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and a partner at the consulting firm RBL Group.\\n\\nThey may share Trump's pro-business agenda, but find it difficult to ignore his personal behavior, Ulrich said.\\n\\nHow do you begin to manage the balance between the person and the policy? And I can imagine these CEOs are really struggling to find that right balance between those two things, Ulrich said.\\n\\nHe noted that corporations have a big stake in policy decisions being made right now, and giving up a seat at the table means having much less influence in Washington.\\n\\nIt's pretty easy for a CEO to say, 'These are my values. You violated them.' But the CEOs who are smart know, 'Once I back out of that opportunity to shape policy, the voice that I could have had is now lost,'  he added.\\n\\nTrump insisted Tuesday that he would have no trouble replacing the departed members of the advisory council and dismissed them as grandstanders.\\n\\nAnd some high-profile companies have said they are staying on the council.\\n\\nWe must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it, said Alex Gorsky, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, in a statement released Tuesday.\\n\\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering, and we will remain active champions for these efforts, said a spokesman for Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison.\\n\\nThe decision to leave is harder for some companies than others.\\n\\nAmong those staying on the council are the CEOs of several major companies that have substantial federal government contracts, including Lockheed Martin and United Technologies.\\n\\nGiven Trump's tendency to hit back hard against anyone who crosses him, such companies may be especially reluctant to anger the White House.\\n\\nIn this environment, it's easier for an executive to release a boilerplate statement condemning hatred than it is to open him or herself or their company up to the president's Twitter-ranting, Pearce said."}
{"original": "California Lawmakers Prepare For Trump, Hire Ex-Attorney General Eric Holder\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nDemocratic leaders of the California Legislature signaled their intention Wednesday to fight any challenges to state policies by the incoming administration of Donald Trump by hiring as outside legal counsel former Attorney General Eric Holder.\\n\\nThe announcement came in a joint statement issued by California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\\n\\nWith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead, said the lawmakers.\\n\\nHolder will assist Gov. Jerry Brown, yet-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Javier Becerra and the Legislature to protect California's economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration. This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great.\\n\\nThe move comes amid escalating rhetoric from California leaders, all Democrats, since the election in which Trump lost the state by more than 4 million votes.\\n\\nLast month Rendon called the Trump administration a major existential threat. Days later, Brown delivered a full-throated warning that California has no intention of reversing its climate change policies.\\n\\nWe've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight, Brown told a group of scientists in San Francisco. We're ready to defend. California is no stranger to this fight.\\n\\nHolder was attorney general in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015. He's currently a partner in the law firm Covington & Burling. According to the Associated Press, the firm will be paid $25,000 a month for three months starting in February.

{"original": "Treating Opioid Addiction With A Drug Raises Hope And Controversy\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images\\n\\nScientists and doctors say the case is clear: The best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.\\n\\nYet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the U.S. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.\\n\\nOne reason is the limited availability of the treatment. But it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.\\n\\nMethadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. A phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. While doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.\\n\\nNow, the White House is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. In his 2017 budget, President Obama has asked Congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.\\n\\nThe White House is also highlighting success stories. At the National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit held in Atlanta in March, Obama appeared on stage with Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio. Oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. She tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. I personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, Oertle said in Atlanta. I couldn't tough it out. I know some people can. I couldn't do it. This last time has been the most successful recovery for me.\\n\\nHer experience isn't unique.\\n\\nI've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says Michael Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. We wouldn't do that with any other disease. If one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\\n\\nBotticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.\\n\\nMethadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. Researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.\\n\\nWe have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says Dr. Marc Fishman, medical director at Maryland Treatment Centers in Baltimore. He says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. Studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.\\n\\nShots - Health News We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment Listen\\n\\nStill, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. Their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.\\n\\nFor years, Juan Ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. When you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.\\n\\nA friend told Ramirez about a doctor in Baltimore who prescribed Suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. He liked the way Suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. He stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. Still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. I was still an addict, he says. It was just legal.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\\n\\nThat line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including David Lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in Hagerstown, Md. The home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. In addition to beds, Lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. The emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. It's what worked for Lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.\\n\\nWhen he started his work as a recovery advocate, Lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. Soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's Suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting Suboxone. That to me just looks like heroin, Lidz says.\\n\\nSo he made a decision: He wouldn't accept anyone on it.\\n\\nToday, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. Now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on Suboxone, Lidz says.\\n\\nHe worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like Charles Testerman, who came to Lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. Testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. He drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. When he couldn't afford heroin, he bought Suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. It didn't work.\\n\\nI was doing Suboxone in the mornings, as well as Adderall to bring myself up. Then at night, I was taking Xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, Testerman says. It was just a constant cycle.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\\n\\nToday, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called The Stoner Farm, Anglicized from Steiner, the name of the family who built the place. Testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. I feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. It's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\\n\\nFishman, the addiction doctor in Baltimore, knows there are people like Testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. But, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. He wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.\\n\\nThis doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. But we don't have the penicillin for addiction. These are not curative medications. In having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations I think would make us more credible."}

{"original": "If a Wealth Tax is Such a Good Idea, Why Did Europe Kill Theirs?\\n\\nEnlarge this image Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\\n\\nNOTE: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\\n\\nIn late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.\\n\\nIt's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.\\n\\nThe disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.\\n\\nEuro Flop\\n\\nNormally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.\\n\\nIn 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.\\n\\nUC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.\\n\\nHe argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.\\n\\nWarren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.\\n\\nAlso important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.\\n\\nBureaucracy and the Constitution\\n\\nBut having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.\\n\\nAnd a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.\\n\\nWhile the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.\\n\\nA Local Problem with a Global Solution\\n\\nIt's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.\\n\\nHis solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.\\n\\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

{"original": "Trump Took Fight For Border Wall To El Paso — Where O'Rourke Was Ready For Him\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump took his fight for a wall to the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday night, promising a crowd in El Paso, Texas, that he would press forward for its construction — even as news was breaking in Washington that a deal reached between congressional negotiators would fall far short of his funding demands.\\n\\nAnd in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, Trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by Democrat Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with Democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a White House bid that could especially challenge Trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a Southern border wall.\\n\\nBut the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that Trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. As another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on Capitol Hill emerged with a deal Monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's Department of Homeland Security funding bill). This will fund about 55 miles of fencing.\\n\\nOn stage, Trump claimed he didn't know the details and didn't want to hear about it, sticking to his robust talking points on the border wall.\\n\\nAs I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway, he said to raucous applause, underneath Finish The Wall banners.\\n\\nSpeaking in an interview with Fox News conducted on the sidelines of the rally, Trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: We'll see what happens. About his push for a border wall, Trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. A wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. It's a moral thing, the president also said in the interview.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. And the selection of a rally in El Paso was no accident either — Trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the U.S. border town compared to its Mexican counterpart. However, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in El Paso.\\n\\nTrump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.\\n\\nThe president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in U.S. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. Multiple polls also showed most Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.\\n\\nIf Trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight Saturday — though Trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.\\n\\nThe whole rally largely stuck to Trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his State of the Union address.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\\n\\nBut Trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally O'Rourke, El Paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily Democratic city. Exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, Trump claimed that O'Rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.\\n\\nThat may be the end of his presidential bid, Trump said, mocking O'Rourke as a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.\\n\\nHe's supposed to win in order to run, the president jabbed. Beto was defeated, Trump said, referring to the race against Cruz, as the president boasted of his own undefeated record in his first bid for office.\\n\\nAccording to NBC News, O'Rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. And Bloomberg News reported that O'Rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. At various points during his own rally, Trump claimed that 69,000 people had RSVP'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. But NBC News reported that Trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.\\n\\nO'Rourke directly took on Trump over border security and Trump's desire for a wall or other physical barrier. He said El Paso was a peaceful and safe city because we treat one another with dignity and respect.\\n\\nWe know that walls do not save lives; walls end lives, O'Rourke also told those gathered at his rally.\\n\\nHe also criticized the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.\\n\\nWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 Democratic candidate said. We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\\n\\nWe will not take advantage of them, O'Rourke added about immigrants. We will not send them back to certain death. We will not believe that walls can or should keep them out. Instead, we welcome them with open arms.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\\n\\nTrump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. Instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.\\n\\nThe Democrat Party has never been more outside the mainstream. They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, Trump said. He criticized Democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.\\n\\nI will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country, Trump said."}
{"original": "Trump And China: Intentionally Provocative Or Unprepared?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIn a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, Donald Trump directed some of his strongest words toward China. He called the Chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of America's leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on China.\\n\\nNow, as president-elect, Trump is sounding the same notes. He caused a veritable earthquake in U.S.-China relations just by taking a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. This challenged the bedrock of U.S. relations, the One China policy, under which the U.S. officially recognizes only the government in Beijing, though it also conducts business with Taipei.\\n\\nAnd at his confirmation hearing last week, Trump's choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, unleashed another salvo. Though it was just one line in a nine-hour hearing, he suggested a Trump administration would be willing to wage a showdown over China's recent island building in the South China Sea.\\n\\nWe're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island building stops, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP\\n\\nSince 2013, China has built seven islands in the South China Sea. An international tribunal last year rejected China's claims to those artificial islands — and its claims to much of the South China Sea. In the meantime, China has also militarized the islands by building airstrips and installing anti-aircraft guns on them.\\n\\nSince Trump is not yet in office, and Tillerson hasn't yet been confirmed, it remains unclear whether Tillerson's statement was a genuine policy position or just get-tough rhetoric as Trump and his team prepare to assume power.\\n\\nA number of Asia analysts believe Tillerson likely misspoke or overstated the positions a Trump administration will take.\\n\\nWhat I think he meant was that we will not let the Chinese use these new airbases on these reclaimed islands to establish dominance in the South China Sea, says Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\\n\\nGreen, a former National Security Council senior director for Asia, says the Trump administration could increase the U.S. Navy's presence in the South China Sea and the frequency of patrols — strategies the Obama administration pursued, but only to a limited degree.\\n\\nMy guess is that [Tillerson] was referring to options such as that — but not stating that the U.S. would blockade or interdict Chinese ships approaching those islands, says Green.\\n\\nGreen says the lack of clarity may be due to the lack of seasoned policy makers in the Trump transition team and the limited input from the State Department.\\n\\nI think the process has been less conducive to a careful and thorough consideration of exact wording than in the past, he says.\\n\\nThe Chinese media was less charitable in its assessment. The China Daily called Tillerson's remarks a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies.\\n\\nSo was David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.\\n\\nThis is insane and totally unenforceable, not to mention very ill-informed, ill-considered, probably not logistically feasible, and highly provocative and war-risking, he says of Tillerson's comments.\\n\\nTaken at face value, the remarks call for a Cuban Missile Crisis-like blockade that would prevent the Chinese from accessing the islands they claim in the South China Sea.\\n\\nDoing that would be no easy task for the U.S. Navy.\\n\\nChina's Navy has been rapidly modernizing in recent years and while it is not going to be able to defeat the U.S. necessarily, they will certainly be able to punish U.S. forces in the region in a way they couldn't before, says Avery Goldstein, director of Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe danger is that a small incident in the South China Sea could quickly escalate into a major conflict.\\n\\nThere is another way to look at Trump's approach so far.\\n\\nAlmost every recent U.S. president has said on the campaign trail that he would take a tougher stance with China. That list includes Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\\n\\nThis approach is not unprecedented, says CSIS's Green. Typically, what happens in every case is that within a few months or a year or two, the policy calibrates and they go back to the norm.\\n\\nGoldstein, of the University of Pennsylvania, says Trump might be using tactics he learned in the business world, where you often stake out your toughest positions in the beginning.\\n\\nPerhaps this is just an attempt to gain bargaining leverage so that at some point, you make a deal that is better than the one you would've gotten if you'd been flexible at the beginning, he says.\\n\\nIt might work. Or backfire.\\n\\nChina has come a long way in recent years and is increasingly assertive in the international arena. President Xi Jinping is no one's idea of a pushover.\\n\\nThe devil, says Goldstein, is in the details. All we have so far are comments and tweets. Until they take office and formulate and implement policy, we can't be sure.\\n\\nNishant Dahiya is NPR's Asia editor."}
{"original": "Off-Duty Police Officers Investigated, Charged With Participating In Capitol Riot\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nNearly 30 sworn police officers from a dozen departments attended the pro-Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol last week, and several stormed the building with rioters and are facing federal criminal charges as well as possible expulsion or other discipline.\\n\\nThe officers are from departments large and small. There was veteran officer in Houston, the nation's eighth-largest department; a sergeant in the small town of Rocky Mount, Va., and a group of Philadelphia transit officers.\\n\\nFive people were killed in the riots, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer when she attempted to breach a barricaded door inside the Capitol.\\n\\nHouston police officer Tam Pham, an 18-year veteran, resigned Thursday in the wake of federal charges against him, Houston Chief Art Acevedo said in a tweet. Photos emerged showing Pham inside the Capitol during the riots holding a Trump flag alongside other pro-Trump extremists. Federal prosecutors are investigating.\\n\\nThere is no excuse for criminal activity, especially from a police officer, Chief Acevedo said. I can't tell you the anger I feel at the thought of a police officer and other police officers thinking they get to go storm the Capitol.\\n\\nIn Virginia, photos emerged showing Rocky Mount Police Sgt. T.J. Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker inside the Capitol with other rioters. Robertson told The Roanoke Times that he and officer Fracker did nothing illegal. Where I was at there was no violence. There was no fighting with police officers.\\n\\nFederal prosecutors say otherwise.\\n\\nEach officer has been charged with one federal count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Both were arrested and released without bond.\\n\\nIn a since-deleted Facebook post, Fracker wrote after the riots: Lol to anyone who's possibly concerned about the picture of me going around... Sorry I hate freedom? ...Not like I did anything illegal...y'all do what you feel you need to. And in screenshot of a Facebook post circulating, Robertson wrote: CNN and the Left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business ... The right IN ONE DAY took the f——— U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.\\n\\nAsked for comment, Town Manager James Ervin said in an email to NPR that the town supports their employees' rights to engage in speech and assembly but expects the actions taken while doing so to be lawful. Ervin declined to comment further, citing the criminal probe. The officers are currently on paid leave, Ervin says, as per town policy.\\n\\nThe federal charges and ongoing investigations are likely to further erode public trust in police and again raise concerns about oversight and accountability, especially in the wake of 2020's nationwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice following the killings of Black men and women by police officers.\\n\\nChuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told NPR the charges against off-duty officers are all the more reprehensible because many officers on duty at the Capitol acted heroically that day.\\n\\nPolice officers should know more than others that engaging in mob behavior is abhorrent. At a time when people are questioning police legitimacy, this isn't helpful. It's worse than that, it's despicable. It's despicable because you have 50 officers hurt and one who died. This is just unconscionable, Wexler said, adding, those officers who engaged in mob behavior should be held accountable and should not be police officers. Period.\\n\\nSue Rahr is the former King County, Wash., sheriff who now runs the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission.\\n\\nOne of the top philosophical statements we make to recruits is you are guardians of the democracy. You're not just there to investigate crimes, but you're there to actually uphold the democracy, because our country depends on the rule of law, Rahr told NPR. And what happened at the Capitol was completely against everything that the concept of the rule of law stands for.\\n\\nIn Texas, Bexar County Sheriff's Lt. Roxanne Mathai, an eight-year veteran of the force, is on unpaid administrative leave after posting photos of herself in the pro-Trump mob on a Capitol balcony after rioters stormed past police lines. She called it on Facebook one of the best days of her life. She also faces possible federal charges. A post on her Facebook page also says and we are going in... in the crowd at the stairs...not inside the capitol like the others. Not catching a case lol.\\n\\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told KSAT TV: My intent is that she never set foot in this building again.\\n\\nMathai's lawyer, Hector Cortes, told the news station that her role in the chaos is really just attending a political rally for a president who she supports. A department spokesman, Deputy Johnny Garcia, told NPR that Mathai already was on administrative leave from a previous incident involving an inappropriate relationship with an inmate in the jail. Garcia declined to elaborate on either case since both are under investigation.\\n\\nThe New York Police Department is looking into allegations one of their officers was among the rioters. John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said on Thursday, We're taking outside tips, we're getting information from the FBI, adding that internal affairs is the recipient of any allegations that anybody who is an employee of the NYPD conducted any illegal activity.\\n\\nSeven off-duty transit police officers in Philadelphia also face scrutiny after they attended the Trump rally preceding the attack on the Capitol, NPR member station WHYY reports.\\n\\nThey are being investigated to see if they were involved in riotous behavior or for violations of our social media policies, said Chief Thomas Nestel of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.\\n\\nIn Seattle, two police officers who attended the rally are also under investigation. Interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz in a statement said that while he fully supports all lawful expressions of free speech, if any SPD officers were directly involved in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, I will immediately terminate them. While OPA investigates, these officers have been placed on administrative leave.\\n\\nIn Chicago, there are calls for the resignation of John Catanzara, who heads the powerful police union. Catanzara at first strongly defended the rioters, called them nonviolent and echoed the president's false claims about election fraud in an interview with NPR station WBEZ. He later apologized.\\n\\nIn Oklahoma, social media posts raise questions about Canadian County Sheriff Chris West, because of statements attributed to him on a since-deleted Facebook account. West said at a press conference that he only attended the rally and did not push past police or enter the Capitol. Last Friday, West said the egregious crimes on our beacon and bastion of last hope for our nation, breaking into that and terrorizing it, I rebuke all of that, every bit of it.\\n\\nBut KFOR TV in Oklahoma reports that a man named Bryan Harter claims he was in the Capitol with the sheriff during the insurrection, posting on Facebook, I was in DC for the protest at the capitol with sheriff west. I took a weeks vacation spent my own money and drove 40 hours round trip! After 23 years of military service, I felt it my duty to stand for us. For fair elections. Honestly they are lucky we just occupied. We literally pushed past the police said we are here and left. Burned nothing looted nothing. Now we are called terrorists. People better wake Up, before its too late.\\n\\nAnd in the deleted Facebook account, KFOR reported, Sheriff West appears to embrace the baseless claims of election fraud pushed by President Trump. If they're okay rigging an election and foreign help to steal the white house and control of WeThePeople, then I'm okay with using whatever means necessary to preserve America and save FREEDOM & LIBERTY.\\n\\nPolice training executive Rahr says she sent a memo to all her recruits and staff reminding them of the important role law enforcement can play in reassuring the public that our democracy can survive the politically divisive conflicts that are erupting. Rahr adds the majority of law enforcement officers in this country are just as ashamed and disgusted as I am because the storming of the Capitol is, there's there's no defense for that. There just isn't.\\n\\nNPR's Martin Kaste contributed to this story."}
{"original": "Evaluating Trump's Foreign Policy From A Conservative Perspective\\n\\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump is a Republican who hasn't had a particularly conservative foreign policy. He called the Iraq War the single worst decision ever made. He's lauded Russia, praised North Korea and said he'll withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Syria. This week, he came back from Hanoi with no deal with Kim Jong Un. There's the prolonged humanitarian political crisis in Venezuela and shifting - are they staying or going - policies of U.S. troops in Syria and Afghanistan. Is this administration's foreign policy unraveling?\\n\\nWe're going to take stock with two foreign policy experts who are conservatives. Danielle Pletka is with the American Enterprise Institute. Thanks so much for being with us.\\n\\nDANIELLE PLETKA: A pleasure.\\n\\nSIMON: And Christopher Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute in our studios - thank you for being with us.\\n\\nCHRISTOPHER PREBLE: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nSIMON: Let's start with North Korea and you first, Danielle Pletka. Does flying halfway around the world to get nothing suggest the administration just isn't doing its homework?\\n\\nPLETKA: Well, yes, frankly, it does. I mean, I think that a lot of people felt, let's say, tolerably comfortable with the idea that Donald Trump wanted to start things off with a person-to-person meeting with Kim Jong Un. But by the second meeting, it appeared that it was meeting for meeting's sake and that the North Korean leader was taking the president of the United States for a ride.\\n\\nSIMON: Mr. Preble - Mr. Preble, sorry.\\n\\nPREBLE: I don't think there's ever an argument against meeting, per se. I take Danielle's point, but there's also - it's also true that we don't have regular dialogue prior to this meeting last year. And so continuing that dialogue at some level seems to me like a good idea. I would hope...\\n\\nSIMON: Just at some level - what about below that?\\n\\nPREBLE: Right. Well, that's the point. Right, that's my point. So I do think that thinking that you can start this from the top down, that perhaps may be true, but you also need to have a working-level dialogue. And I would hope that that will continue even though this particular meeting in Hanoi did not produce any breakthrough.\\n\\nSIMON: But did just having these two summits and President Trump's almost rhapsodic praise boosted Kim Jong Un's prestige?\\n\\nPREBLE: I don't endorse the praise, but I don't - I also don't believe that meeting with a leader necessarily implies an endorsement of their behavior and their - the treatment of their people. The president, after all, has met with a number of other leaders who have horrendous human rights records, including, for example, our allies, the Saudis. So that by itself does not trouble me.\\n\\nSIMON: Danielle Pletka, I want to get you to talk about Venezuela, if I could - President Maduro refusing to step down despite international and U.S. pressure. Do you see a discernible U.S. policy there?\\n\\nPLETKA: Actually, I think Venezuela is a real success story for this administration and in a very conventional way, actually. You know, here we see that the administration actually did some homework. They built the foundations. They worked with our allies. They worked with the multilateral, in this case, the Organization of American States. They really have brought together, you know, a coalition of, at this point, dozens of countries that recognize the now constitutional leader of Venezuela, Mr. Guaido. And they are ratcheting up pressure in ways that are, I think, quite careful.\\n\\nI recognize that this is going to be a hard slog. Maduro and his backers in Havana are very, very committed to hanging on. They have that exploited the Venezuelan people and the economy much to their personal financial advantage. And they don't want to let that go. But I do think the administration has actually shown a lot of skill in this area. I've been very impressed. And they've been quiet about it as well, which is something that we so rarely see from Donald Trump.\\n\\nSIMON: I want to get you to talk about that, too, Mr. Preble, but let me insert would it help for the United States to give a pledge of no military intervention to assuage people who are concerned that that's where it's headed?\\n\\nPREBLE: Well, I think people are concerned about it, and I think they should be concerned about that. The United States has a track record of using military force and violating the sovereignty of a number of countries, not just in this hemisphere but around the world. So I think that it is important to emphasize that there is a constitutional process that Juan Guaido is - has a legitimate claim. And I think it's equally important that the Lima Group, not just the Organization of American States but an organization - a loose coalition of states not led by the United States has endorsed Guaido is significant. But I think the United States could complicate things if it implies, as some have, that ultimately the United States is going to determine this by force.\\n\\nSIMON: Let me ask you both and begin with you again, Danielle Pletka - has the United States abdicated a leadership role in the world? And has that - does that really assist the world at this moment?\\n\\nPLETKA: That's a very tough question. You know, I mean, I firmly believe that the world is a better place when the United States leads. You know, the world is not a place where when we step back that nobody else steps in. There are plenty of eager players on the global stage, whether it's the Chinese with the rules that they like to promulgate or the Russians or even regionally whether it's the Iranians or others. You really do see that there are actual challenges to our global leadership.\\n\\nThe question of whether we've abdicated, though, is a - much more than a Trump question because this really began in the Obama administration. President Obama was much less committed to the American global role. And, you know, let's set aside these questions of exceptionalism that's obsessed, you know, the front pages but just less committed to an American leadership profile abroad...\\n\\nSIMON: Leading from behind was the phrase I remember from Libya, yeah.\\n\\nPLETKA: Yes, a most regrettable phrase for a most regrettable - a badly managed, badly led and badly concluded operation in Libya. So, you know, this has been a trend. And the one thing I think is absolutely clear, and I expect that Chris will disagree with me about this, but the one thing I think is clear is that without presidential leadership, the American people don't actually understand or want to sign up to anything that we do overseas except perhaps global trade. And even there now, we see a question.\\n\\nSIMON: Christopher Preble.\\n\\nPREBLE: Well, actually, Danielle and I agree on the importance of trade, and I think the president has taken a bad step in the wrong direction on that. But in terms of U.S. leadership, we have to remember where this all started. After World War II, the entire world was shattered, and the few countries that were capable of doing anything about it, one of them was the Soviet Union. And so in that context, I was pretty happy to see the United States take a leading role. But it's striking to me that Danielle mentions Russia and China and even Iran regionally but not any of the other countries in the world - of which there are roughly 190 other countries in the world - which might actually take a more leading role, at least in their own region. And, again, that's why I point back to what's happened in Venezuela and the response of other countries in the region. I just...\\n\\nSIMON: Are you speaking of, let's say, for example, India and Southeast Asia?\\n\\nPREBLE: Right, sure, of course, India or in Europe, there are still a number of important, powerful players. You look at the way that the other parties to the Iran nuclear deal are continuing to abide by that deal and try to move it forward. These are countries that have identified what their interests are, and they do not necessarily align with the United States.\\n\\nSIMON: Christopher Preble is vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. You have a book out next month - Peace, War, And Liberty: Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute; thank you both very much for being with us.\\n\\nPREBLE: Thank you.\\n\\nPLETKA: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

{"original": "Feds To Waive Penalties For Some Who Signed Up Late For Medicare\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images/iStockphoto Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nEach year, thousands of Americans miss their deadline to enroll in Medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. That failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.\\n\\nNow Medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from those late-enrollment penalties for anyone who kept the ACA policy after becoming eligible for Medicare Part B. For those 65 and older and for people with disabilities, Medicare Part B covers doctor visits and outpatient care.\\n\\nMany of these people who missed the deadline did not receive the information necessary ... through the marketplace to make an informed decision regarding Medicare enrollment, says a Medicare spokesman, explaining the policy change.\\n\\nAutumn deadline to request a waiver of the late-enrollment penalty\\n\\nPeople age 65 and older who have a marketplace plan or had one they lost or canceled, as well as people who qualify for Medicare because of a disability, but chose to stay with a marketplace plan, may qualify for the penalty waiver or a reduction. They'll now have until Sept. 30 to request the waiver, according to federal health officials.\\n\\nThis has been a problem from the beginning of the Affordable Care Act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for Medicare, says Bonnie Burns, a consultant for the consumer group California Health Advocates. Once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for Medicare, nobody told them to make that change.\\n\\nLisa Grimes' 49-year-old sister is one of those people. She receives Social Security disability benefits because of mental illness. She became eligible for Medicare automatically because of the disability benefits, but she had marketplace coverage at that time. (Grimes agreed to be interviewed as long as her sister was not identified.)\\n\\nGrimes' sister mistakenly opted to keep her marketplace plan and drop her Part B coverage, probably because her marketplace premium at the time cost half as much, says Grimes. That decision has kept Grimes, a St. Louis real estate lawyer, busy for months, unraveling the consequences.\\n\\nOnly after the sister's $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did she and Grimes learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join Medicare.\\n\\nThe rules are tricky, and mistakes are common\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn't need Part B if they had a marketplace plan, or retiree coverage from a former employer, or health coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or via a current employer with fewer than 20 workers. Beneficiaries didn't realize that none of these is a substitute for Medicare Part B.\\n\\nGrimes says her sister couldn't afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. After that, the Social Security Administration denied her appeal to reinstate her Part B coverage with no penalty or wait period. Then she learned about the new Medicare waiver — from a Missouri counselor at the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\\n\\nIt took several hours for Grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. But with assistance from the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received Part B coverage without a late fee or waiting period. It was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.\\n\\nUsually people need to sign up for Part B within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to Medicare rules. Most people under 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits qualify for Part B after 24 months of benefits.\\n\\nUnder the ACA, people who qualify for Medicare will lose subsidies if they choose to remain in plans purchased on the federal or state exchanges. And being enrolled in one of those plans does not protect them from a permanent late enrollment penalty from Medicare.\\n\\nMarketplace insurers, who are often the first to spot when a member is turning 65, are barred under the health law from canceling coverage because that member may qualify for Medicare, Burns says.\\n\\nLast summer, Medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. The notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in Marketplace and Medicare coverage. Officials also began contacting individuals who already have both Medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.\\n\\nHow to get a waiver of the penalty\\n\\nYet many people have missed the warnings.\\n\\nThese are very complex rules, says Stacy Sanders, federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, which spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors' advocacy organizations to convince Medicare officials to address the problem.\\n\\nThe lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying Part B, Sanders says.\\n\\nIn March, Medicare began emailing letters about the temporary waiver to some people 65 and older who are enrolled in plans sold on the marketplaces run by the federal government. But others who may be eligible for a waiver are not getting those notices.\\n\\nCalifornia, which has the largest state-run marketplace, serving 1.4 million consumers, is planning a similar information campaign. So are some other states that run their own marketplaces, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.\\n\\nPeople who may be eligible for the waiver, officially called time-limited equitable relief, must submit a request by Sept. 30. You can find information on how to apply on the Medicare Rights Center's Medicare Interactive website or can call the center's helpline at 800-333-4114.\\n\\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Hey, this is not a test. This is rock 'n' roll. Time to rock it from the delta to the DMZ. Is that me, or does that sound like an Elvis Presley movie? Viva Da Nang. (Singing) Oh, Viva Da Nang.\\n\\nGROSS: That's Robin Williams in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam playing a fictionalized version of Adrian Cronauer. Cronauer died last Wednesday at the age of 79. In 1965, during the war in Vietnam, he was a DJ in Saigon on Armed Forces Radio hosting a Top 40 radio show called Dawn Buster in which he signed on each morning with the now-famous words, good morning, Vietnam. After returning to the States, he continued working in broadcasting. But with the money he earned from the movie, he went to law school.\\n\\nI spoke with him in early 1988 when he was a second-year law student at the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to become active in veterans' causes and served as an adviser to the State Department's Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Office. I asked him what the Armed Forces Radio station in Saigon sounded like when he got there.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\\n\\nADRIAN CRONAUER: If you've seen the film, you'll notice at the very beginning there was a very dull, dry, boring, soporific announcement about how to get your hold baggage if you'd lost your duffel bag or your trunk out of Tan Son Nhut Air Base. That is as accurate depiction as is humanly possible of what the station sounded like when I got there. And one of my aims was just to make it sound more like a stateside station.\\n\\nGROSS: How did you sign on the first morning that you did your show?\\n\\nCRONAUER: The same as I did every other one. We would have a little bit of music from an album called Like Tweet by Joe Puma and the Audiobon All-Stars.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nCRONAUER: And then I would say, good morning, Vietnam, and then start into the program that way.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: Did you get an immediate reaction from the soldiers who were listening to your show?\\n\\nCRONAUER: No. The reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. We did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. First of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. But secondly, there was a reaction that I would get mostly when I went out into the field. We would get an occasional card and letter. But if I'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? And I'd say Cronauer. And they'd say, oh, yeah, I think I - and I'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. And I found out later on that many times the GIs, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if I'd do the good morning, Vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the GI equivalent of get stuffed, Cronauer.\\n\\nGROSS: (Laughter) What did you play the most when you were on the air?\\n\\nCRONAUER: Whatever happened to be currently popular, again, looking at what were the popular songs in the States and assuming that the GIs who came over from the States would want to hear what's popular back at home. Our whole idea was whether it was in the music policy or the production that we did on the air, it was to make it sound as much as possible like a stateside radio station to give them a little link with home as a morale factor.\\n\\nGROSS: In the movie, the Robin Williams version of Adrian Cronauer is censored when he wants to read the real news that comes across the wire. All the news that comes over the wire is first presented to censors. And in the movie, the character witnesses a bombing at a restaurant that a lot of the Army men hang out in, and he's not allowed to mention that on the air. Similar things happened to you?\\n\\nCRONAUER: On the subject of censorship, the movie is very accurate, except in one small detail. We did not have censors on premises at the stations. It was done by phone. But there was indeed a restaurant called the My Canh floating restaurant. It was built on a boat that was moored in the Saigon River.\\n\\nAnd one evening, I had dinner there with some friends from the station. And after dinner, we were still hanging out in the area when the Viet Cong sprayed the boat with shrapnel from a Claymore mine. And then, about three or four minutes later, when everyone was panicking and trying to get off the boat, they aimed another Claymore mine directly at the gangplank and did a lot of carnage. And I heard the report of the explosion and the commotion and went back to see what was going on, tried to help out a bit and then went back to the station to see if I could put the item on the air.\\n\\nAnd I called the duty officer for permission to put the story on the air and was denied permission. And I asked for a reason. And he said, we have no official confirmation of this happening yet. And I explained that I had been there in person, had seen it with my own eyes. And the answer was still, no, we have no real confirmation of any casualties. And I said, sir, with my own eyes, I've seen heads severed from torsos. Barring the second coming, they will not get up and walk away. And the final answer was no. And the final reason was, well, suppose we're wrong.\\n\\nGROSS: So you didn't defy the order and then go on the air, right (laughter)?\\n\\nCRONAUER: No, I did not go and lock myself in the studio and put it on anyway. No. In fact, there are a lot of things in that movie that Robin does - if I had actually done them, I would have been court martialed, and I'd still be in Leavenworth.\\n\\nGROSS: When you were on the air, were there any signs in the control room that there was actually a war going on?\\n\\nCRONAUER: It was basically a traditional, ordinary, run-of-the-mill radio station control room. The only real reminder of the war was the fact that on the console beside the turntables was a loaded .45. Over in the newsroom, there was another one beside the teletype machines. And we were instructed that if it was necessary, we were expected to use it.\\n\\nGROSS: You were in Vietnam in 1965. And that was a year that the war really escalated. What were some of the things that you saw that made you realize that the war was really changing?\\n\\nCRONAUER: When I got to Saigon in May of '65, it was a sleepy, little French colonial town. And in one year's time, I saw it turn into a nightmare. The massive influx of American personnel, equipment, armament, money turned the city upside down. There were the - when I left, the black market was flourishing. The economy was in disarray. The traffic was unmanageable. The entire city was ridiculous. And although I found it a very enjoyable place to be when I first got there, in the context of a - that it was a war going on, it was - I was very glad to get out.\\n\\nGROSS: What was your reaction the first time you saw the completed movie?\\n\\nCRONAUER: For about five minutes or so, it was difficult to get used to the idea that, well, that's Adrian Cronauer up there, but I'm Adrian Cronauer. But he's me, but I'm here. And then finally, I just settled down and said, all right, relax. Enjoy the movie.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, Adrian Cronauer, I want to thank you very much for talking with me.\\n\\nCRONAUER: My pleasure.\\n\\nGROSS: Adrian Cronauer, recorded in 1988 after the release of the film Good Morning, Vietnam, in which Robin Williams played a fictionalized version of Cronauer. Cronauer died Wednesday. He was 79.\\n\\nTomorrow on FRESH AIR, can we eat meat ethically? We'll get a resounding yes from my guest, Camas Davis.

{"original": "After Holland approves a case, it then goes to the desk of Maj. Gen. Kelly McKeague, JPAC's military commander. He has never denied a request, but he says the extreme scrutiny is more than justified. The work JPAC does, McKeague says, matters more than work the FBI might do in a death penalty case.\\n\\nThere's much more at stake, he says. It defines us as a nation.\\n\\nMcKeague then cites a quote attributed to Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States: The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself forgotten.\\n\\nThird, the process is mired in bureaucracy. The disinterments JPAC does approve must go through additional government layers to the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the Army for final approval. While these steps tend to be a rubber stamp — the Army has never turned JPAC down — DNA can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.\\n\\nHolland acknowledges that the best way to honor those individuals would be to identify them, and that the quickest way to do that would be to exhume them and use DNA. Still, he's conservative; he says he's handcuffed by Pentagon policy and hesitant to lose any more autonomy by pushing for more disinterments.\\n\\nAnd there's an additional complication: Disinterred remains that JPAC can't identify end up sitting in boxes on shelves in a closet. Most people agree that's not the way to honor soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice, and JPAC told NPR and ProPublica that the standard for disinterring U.S. service members is very high. They don't want to dig up remains unless they are pretty confident they can identify them.\\n\\nAbout 20 percent of the 45,000 MIAs and POWs the Pentagon believes are recoverable are interred as unknowns in American military cemeteries around the world.\\n\\nOne of them is Bud Kelder. He is buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, and his family still wants him to come home.\\n\\nBud lived through hell, says his cousin, Ron Kelder. Of his 26 years of life, the last seven months was sheer hell. That's not where Bud would want to be. Our government has a policy of returning everybody, leave nobody behind. I think they should honor it."}
{"original": "Flint Pediatrician Says Charges Against Ex-Governor Help 'Wounds Finally Close'\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\\n\\nThe Flint, Mich., water crisis resulted in charges Wednesday against former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who is now facing two counts of willful neglect of duty.\\n\\nThe misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. They come almost seven years after the city of Flint began taking in water from the Flint River in an attempt to save money. The water wasn't properly treated, and it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. More than 100,000 Flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead.\\n\\nDuring an arraignment Thursday, Snyder pleaded not guilty to the charges. Several additional officials are also facing charges over their alleged roles in the crisis, including the state's former health director and Flint's former director of public works.\\n\\nThe charges drew mixed reactions from people who have been working to help the city deal with the crisis and its aftermath.\\n\\nAccountability is great, but even with accountability, even if Rick Snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with residents, said LaTricea Adams, who heads Black Millennials For Flint, which advocates for the rights of Flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.\\n\\nMona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who was among the first to raise a red flag over the contamination, said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition that having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\\n\\nYears ago, Hanna-Attisha began noticing that her young patients in Flint were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood following the change in the water supply. She called a press conference in September 2015 and warned residents, especially children, to stop drinking the water.\\n\\nMore than five years later, Hanna-Attisha is now the director of Flint's pediatric public health initiative. She is also the author of What the Eyes Don't See, a book about her experiences in the crisis.\\n\\nBelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nCan I ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong. What was going through your mind?\\n\\nIt was the summer of 2015. I was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. And she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that Mona, the water isn't being treated properly in Flint. And because of that, there's probably lead in the water. And that's the moment that my life changed. When I heard the word lead, it was a call to action. I respect the science of what lead does. I understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. And I also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. It's the last thing our kids in Flint needed. That's the moment I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating, I lost about 30 pounds. And I began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.\\n\\nWhat do you make of these charges now?\\n\\nIt's a bit of disbelief. It's been so long. And for so many people in Flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied — that there was never going to be this level of accountability. And as a physician in Flint, I never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. There [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. And as I began to practice more in Flint and interact with the families in Flint, I began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. Because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. And it's been open for about seven years. And having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\\n\\nYou've written a book, and in it you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. Can you explain how you see that?\\n\\nSo many people ask me, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? And there's not one villain. There's not 10 villains. There [are] many villains. And this is what I say in my book:\\n\\nThere are lots of villains in this story. A disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. Many people stopped caring about Flint and Flint's kids. Many people looked the other way. People in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. While charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. Because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. The real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.\\n\\nAnd these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison Flint with policy. And I hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.\\n\\nWhat could that possibly look like now? Even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?\\n\\nThat has been my work since Day 1. From the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. You can think of what happened in Flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. And we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. So what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support Flint families — like child care, like Medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. Because what Flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. And people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.\\n\\nWould the crisis have happened had Flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?\\n\\nOf course not. Flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. It never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. There's a long history of racism in Flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.\\n\\nAs the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is.\\n\\nMy focus is to make sure that the kids of Flint have the brightest future possible, that we can not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.\\n\\nCatherine Whelan produced the audio version of this story.

{"original": "Remembering A Congressman Who Bucked His Party On An Impeachment\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\\n\\nWhen I met Tom Railsback a few years ago, he told me he'd worried about going to a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Peoria in the fall of 1974.\\n\\nTom Railsback of Illinois was a middle-aged Republican congressman from a state in the middle of America when he was on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 that heard the case for impeachment against President Richard Nixon.\\n\\nMr. Railsback greatly admired President Nixon. His opening of the door to China, he told me, had to be the most brilliant foreign policy move ever.\\n\\nBut, when President Nixon refused to turn over records and recordings requested by Congress, Tom Railsback took to the floor to say, If the Congress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to exonerate, we'll be regarded as a paper tiger.\\n\\nTom Railsback worked with Democrats to draft an article of impeachment that charged President Nixon with abuse of his authority to obstruct the Watergate investigation. It was this article that won support from six Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. And when Richard Nixon realized he could not take Republican support for granted, he resigned in August of 1974.\\n\\nTom Railsback, as of this moment, is a dead duck, declared the Journal Star of Peoria, a city near his district.\\n\\nHow will this play in Peoria? was an old vaudeville phrase that people in the Nixon administration also used to ask if a policy would be popular in what they took to be the heart of America.\\n\\nSo, when the congressman was invited for lunch at the Peoria Chamber of Commerce just a few weeks later, he knew friends and neighbors who had supported him would be there, and be upset.\\n\\nBut I figured, he told me, you have to look the people you represent in the eye. Give them a chance to tell you you're wrong.\\n\\nTom Railsback remembered that when he walked into the Peoria dining room, it fell silent. Then he heard one person start to applaud; then a few more; and soon people all over the room stood up to applaud.\\n\\nPeople came up to shake my hand, he said, and tell me, 'Tom, I disagree with that vote. But you did what you thought was right, and I'm glad you represent me.' \\n\\nTom Railsback died this week at the age of 87. He was reelected to Congress after his impeachment vote, time after time after time."}
{"original": "In Japan, Pence Talks Trade And North Korea's Threat To The Region\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda is focused. The other major issue is trade. Pence met with Japan's prime minister.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where so much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda has been focused, especially with these tensions with North Korea. In Tokyo this morning, the vice president repeated what he had said the day before in South Korea.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The United States will continue to work with Japan and with all our allies in the region, including South Korea, to confront the most ominous threat posing this region of the world - the regime in North Korea.\\n\\nGREENE: Of course, North Korea is not the only subject on the vice president's mind. And NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following the trip and joins us from Tokyo. Anthony, good morning.\\n\\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\\n\\nGREENE: So trade is the other big issue here on this visit. The Trump administration, as we know, has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that was so prominent on the campaign trail. And they keep talking about, quote, bilateral agreements. What is the point of stressing that word?\\n\\nKUHN: The idea, David, is that the U.S. wants to renegotiate trade deals not with the whole region of Asia but with individual trading partners and that includes Japan. And Pence emphasized that they want a more level playing field, better terms of trade that gives American companies better access to the Japanese market, allows them to sell more products and create more jobs in the U.S.\\n\\nGREENE: So is Japan open to this? Is there a way that they can get something out of a new deal with the United States?\\n\\nKUHN: Well, you know, Japan feels that they worked so hard for so many years on the TPP. And they got a - what they thought was a pretty good deal. So basically they would like not to kill it off. They would like to keep the TPP alive with the other 11 countries, keep it in some form and then do a separate, perhaps, bilateral deal with the U.S. later.\\n\\nBut they are wary of any new deal that would challenge their protection of certain sectors, most importantly agriculture. Rice, as you can imagine, is a very politically symbolic industry in Japan.\\n\\nGREENE: So interesting too because Shinzo Abe, the Japanese leader, the first leader to meet with Donald Trump, gave him a golden golf club, I mean, has really been trying to develop this relationship and probably hoping that he has some sort of leverage.\\n\\nKUHN: That's right. But, you know, the relationship has changed a lot since President Trump or Trump back in the 1980s started railing against the imbalances in trade. You know, the Japanese economy has stagnated for more than two decades. And it's been eclipsed by China as the second largest economy.\\n\\nAnd Japan is just not seen as the economic threat and competitor that it was. And at the same time, you know, the importance of Japanese-invested factories that create jobs in places like Indiana, where Mike Pence was governor before, have become very important.\\n\\nNow, there are also new things. Japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when President Trump would like to build more infrastructure in the U.S. And also remember that in 2011 following the Fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, Japan shut down its nuclear plants. So now Japan is a very good market for U.S. exports of oil and natural gas.\\n\\nGREENE: So it almost sounds like Donald Trump had this line from the 1980s and maybe he's using the same line for a country that really has changed a lot?\\n\\nKUHN: Yes, that's true in China as well. He blamed both countries for devaluing their currency when it hasn't been the case for quite awhile. Trump is still very concerned about keeping the yen on, you know, the yen weak to the dollar - I mean, excuse me, strong to the dollar so that Japanese exports don't flood the U.S. market.\\n\\nGREENE: OK. NPR's Anthony Kuhn covering the vice president's trip to Japan, speaking to us from Tokyo. Anthony, thanks a lot.\\n\\nKUHN: You're welcome.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Trump Appears To Back Off 2-State Solution In Meeting With Netanyahu\\n\\nMeeting Israel's prime minister, President Trump said he does not think a Palestinian state next to Israel is necessarily the way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, representing a shift in U.S. policy.\\n\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\n\\nNow let's look at what Donald Trump had to say about Israel as he stood alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.\\n\\nMICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: For decades, the U.S. approach to the Middle East peace process was based on the idea of two states for two peoples, the Palestinians and the Israelis. But Donald Trump is shaking this up.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.\\n\\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Laughter).\\n\\nTRUMP: I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one.\\n\\nKELEMEN: That's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chuckling in the background. When an Israeli journalist pressed him on this, Netanyahu said he didn't want to get bogged down in labels. The Israeli prime minister says he's looking for new ways to reach peace with the Palestinians.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nNETANYAHU: And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach, from involving our newfound Arab partners.\\n\\nKELEMEN: It's been dubbed the outside-in approach, and the idea is that Arab states will encourage the Palestinians to make peace with Israel, and Israel will get broad recognition in the Muslim world. David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy says Arab states may be working more closely now with Israel on security issues but don't want to stick out their neck for Netanyahu.\\n\\nDAVID MAKOVSKY: Right now, the Arab states have an under-the-table relationship with the Israelis, and whatever they get from Israel under the table they get for free, so to speak. So I don't know if they have an incentive to go above the table, and I don't know if that's going to bring the Palestinians in or not.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Makovsky doesn't believe the Trump administration is really backing away from the idea of a two-state solution. He says Trump's remarks were mainly for political tactical reasons to help out Netanyahu, whose critics at home made this a key issue.\\n\\nMAKOVSKY: In many ways, the question of whether we're going to hit a two-state solution is like saying, how are we going to get the runner home from third base when we don't even have a runner on first base yet?\\n\\nKELEMEN: Palestinians, though, are calling on Trump and Netanyahu to be clear about the alternatives - either a non-democratic Israel that treats Palestinians as second-class citizens or a country that no longer has a Jewish majority. We reached Hanan Ashrawi of the PLO's executive committee in Ramallah.\\n\\nHANAN ASHRAWI: If they want one state, let's deal with citizenship and equal rights. And we'll all become citizens of that one state, and we will act democratically.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Ashrawi says President Trump is going against the global consensus on the Middle East and listening so far mainly to right-wing leaders in Israel and to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose family has supported Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank.\\n\\nASHRAWI: They know that they cannot make any moves, or they cannot launch any kind of peace initiative if they want one without addressing the Palestinian question and talking to the Palestinian political leadership. And I think they will sooner or later. Right now, I think they're feeling their way. They're not sure. I'd much rather they study the file, they study the case before they jump to conclusions.\\n\\nKELEMEN: There are some signs that Trump may already be moderating his positions. He says he's still studying whether to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. Arab leaders have been privately urging him not to do that, and they've raised concerns about the Israeli government's plans to expand settlements in the West Bank. Trump had a message for Netanyahu on that today, too.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nTRUMP: I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made.\\n\\nKELEMEN: Netanyahu seemed to be taken aback and was making no promises to rein in building projects. He argued that this is not the core of the problem.

The foreign ministry confirmed it Tuesday: Tariffs will drop from 25 percent to 15 percent for imported cars. Tariffs on imported auto parts will fall to six percent.\\n\\nU.S. manufacturers and policymakers have been arguing for years that China should lower its tariffs. President Trump railed against the imbalance in trade tariffs in April, tweeting that they amount to STUPID TRADE. The U.S. imposes a tariff of just 2.5 percent on vehicles imported from China.\\n\\nThe tariff reduction is seen as an olive branch to the Trump administration. It comes as the two countries work to avoid a trade war after the tough-talk and tariff escalations last month.\\n\\nChina is a huge market for the U.S. auto industry. America shipped almost $10 billion worth of vehicles to China in 2017, according to the Commerce Department, plus another $3.5 billion in vehicle parts.\\n\\nBut much of that trade originates from companies whose headquarters are outside the U.S. BMW and Mercedes-Benz, for example, build cars in the U.S. to be shipped to China.

{"original": "Libertarian Candidates Pitch Themselves As Antidote To Partisanship\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\\n\\nLibertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees.\\n\\nBoth are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues.\\n\\nWe want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think that, said Weld, the party's vice presidential nominee.\\n\\nJohnson, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 before becoming the Libertarian nominee four years ago, said if they are elected, the two longtime lawmakers will almost act as co-presidents — sharing a staff and planning to do this as a partnership.\\n\\nTwo heads for the price of one, and that it would be a plus for the country, believing that, the former New Mexico governor said.\\n\\nI think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House, and we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party, the smartest people from the Republican Party and the best people from the Libertarian Party, Weld added.\\n\\nThe two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.\\n\\nA third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void.\\n\\nThe idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington, Weld said. That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.\\n\\nJohnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was beholden to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that smacks of pay-to-play.\\n\\nBut Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq.\\n\\nHe's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man, Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.\\n\\nJohnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though.\\n\\nA wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil, he told a questioner.\\n\\nJohnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that religious freedom, as a category was a black hole, and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding.\\n\\nI fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against, Johnson said. There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.\\n\\nShetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.\\n\\nMy head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up, Johnson said. This discrimination does exist.\\n\\nOn the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.\\n\\nWe both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists, Johnson said. We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists. We don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe."}

J.B. Pritzker on Friday afternoon issued an order for all Illinois residents to stay at home, as the deadly coronavirus has spread to a quarter of the state's counties and infected more than 500 people.\\n\\nThe stricter limits go into effect on Saturday.\\n\\nThey follow a similar order by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who issued a mandate earlier on Friday, and another by California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday. The governors of Connecticut, Nevada and New Jersey also say they want people to stay at home.\\n\\nWe know this will be hard, Pritzker said in a news conference, adding that the new rules are expected to last until April 7.\\n\\nThat gives us time to see whether or not this social distancing ... is having the desired effect of slowing the spread of COVID-19, he said.\\n\\nPritzker said essential services including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open, and restaurants will be allowed to continue take-out services. But most other places will have to shut down.\\n\\nHowever, he pleaded with people not to rush out to a grocery store or gas station to stockpile essential goods.\\n\\nHealth care professionals and other essential workers will be provided with safe child care, according to Pritzker, who offered no details on how such programs will work. Students will also continue receiving free meals, he said.\\n\\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took what what he calls the ultimate step in his state to protect the public, signing an executive order mandating that 100% of workforce must stay home, excluding essential services.\\n\\nThe order, which Cuomo announced Friday, excludes businesses such as pharmacies and grocery stores, along with essential services such as utilities and Internet providers.\\n\\nWhen I talk about the most drastic action we can take — this is the most drastic action we can take, Cuomo said.\\n\\nIn addition to the workforce order, all nonessential gatherings of individuals in New York state are now canceled — of ANY size for ANY reason, Cuomo said via Twitter. The ban applies to any party, celebration or social event.\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nNew York has confirmed more than 7,100 cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, making it by far the largest single source of the nearly 15,500 cases now reported in the U.S. As of Friday, 38 people in the state had died from the respiratory disease. Nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for killing at least 205 people.\\n\\nNew York has tested more than 32,000 people for the virus, including 10,000 in one day, Cuomo said. And he said the high number of new cases — New York added some 2,900 coronavirus cases from Thursday to Friday — should not in itself worry people.\\n\\nIt was the reality, he said. The tests are just demonstrating what was.\\n\\nBut in a separate part of his news conference, the governor also said his state must add more hospital beds and ventilators to accommodate the influx of COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nThe rate of increase in the number of cases portends a total overwhelming of our hospital system, Cuomo said.\\n\\nNew York is working to boost its number of hospital beds, which currently stands at around 50,000. The governor's office says around 18% of the state's coronavirus cases, or 1,255 people, are currently hospitalized.\\n\\nI believe these policies will save lives. And I'm not willing to put a price on a human life, Cuomo said at a news conference late Friday morning.\\n\\nStaying at home doesn't mean not being permitted to exercise outdoors.\\n\\nIt's running. It's hiking, Cuomo said of the preferred activities. It's not playing basketball with five other people. That's not what it is. It's not laying in a park with 10 other people and sharing a beer. That's not what this is.\\n\\nThe New York order is similar to escalating steps taken in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home indefinitely to stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\nAs of noon ET Friday, Washington state had reported 1,376 coronavirus cases, and California had reported 1,030, according to a COVID-19 dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, which reports coronavirus numbers in near real time.\\n\\nCoronavirus: Know The Basics (And Wash Your Hands)\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\n\\nThe primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people also experience fatigue, headaches and, less frequently, diarrhea. Cases can range from mild to moderate to severe. About 80 percent of cases so far seem to be mild, according to the World Health Organization.\\n\\nTo prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer if a sink isn't available. The WHO says people should wear face masks only if they're sick or caring for someone who is.\\n\\nWhat should I do if I think I'm sick?\\n\\nIf you think you've been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Many state and local health departments have set up hotlines to answer questions, so that's another good place to start. It's important that you don't expose others. Call your doctor before you go to their clinic so they can take necessary precautions.\\n\\nHow do I protect my home?\\n\\nWash your hands as soon as you walk through the door. Avoid sharing personal items such dishes, cups, utensils. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces like door handles and cellphones every day.\\n\\nHow do I self-quarantine? And what does it mean?\\n\\nThe CDC has a guide for caring for yourself at home if you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19."}
{"original": "Trump Officials Approve Tennessee's Controversial Request To Revamp Medicaid Funding\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\\n\\nWith less than a dozen days left in power, the Trump administration on Friday approved a radically different Medicaid financing system in Tennessee. With this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from Washington, allowing Tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend Medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.\\n\\nInstead of the open-ended federal contribution to the funding of Medicaid in all other states — which increases with higher enrollment and associated health costs — Tennessee will instead get a capped amount of money, via an annual block grant.\\n\\nThe annual funding cap will increase if enrollment grows. What's different is that, unlike with other states, Medicaid funding to Tennessee won't automatically keep up with rising expenses.\\n\\nThe approval is a 10-year experiment, according to Friday's announcement by Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. They think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.\\n\\nBut Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center sees the move as a step backward for the state's Medicaid program.\\n\\nNo other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, Johnson says. It gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.\\n\\nTennessee is one of 12 states that have not approved expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act – a decision that's left tens of thousands of working adults in Tennessee without health insurance.\\n\\nWhether this change in the way Tennessee's Medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. The incoming Biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.\\n\\nImplementing such a fundamental change via an executive branch action rather than getting Congress to amend Medicaid law is also likely to be met with court challenges.\\n\\nIn any event, the changes to the state's program will take months to implement because the shift in policy requires final approval by the legislature, and officials in Tennessee must also negotiate quality of care targets with the administration.\\n\\nTennCare, the state's Medicaid program, says the new system would give it unprecedented flexibility to decide who is covered and what services it will pay for.\\n\\nUnder the agreement, TennCare will have a specified annual spending cap, to be based on historical spending, inflation and predicted future enrollment changes. If the state can operate the program at a lower cost than the cap and maintain or improve quality, the state then shares in the savings.\\n\\nTrump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. If Medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. If enrollment drops, it will get less money.\\n\\nThis groundbreaking waiver puts guardrails in place to ensure appropriate oversight and protections for beneficiaries, while also creating incentives for states to manage costs — while holding them accountable for improving access, quality and health outcomes, Verma said. It's no exaggeration to say that this carefully crafted demonstration could be a national model moving forward.\\n\\nThe agreement is somewhat different from traditional block grants championed by conservatives, the CMS notes, since it allows Tennessee to get more federal funding as enrollment grows. And while the state is given flexibility to increase benefits, it can't on its own cut benefits.\\n\\nHowever, opponents — including most advocates for low-income Americans — say the approach will threaten care for the 1.4 million people in TennCare — a group that includes children, pregnant women and the disabled. Federal funding covers two-thirds of the cost of the program.\\n\\nDemocrats have fought back against block grant Medicaid proposals since the Reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of Republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act. Even some key Republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.\\n\\nThe approval of Tennessee's request comes as Medicaid enrollment is at its highest-ever level.\\n\\nMore than 76 million Americans are covered by the state-federal health program — a million more than when the Trump administration took charge in 2017. Enrollment has jumped by more than 5 million in the past year as the economy slumped with the pandemic.\\n\\nMedicaid, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. As a result, the more money states spend on Medicaid, the more they get from Washington.\\n\\nThe newly approved demonstration project in Tennessee calls for CMS to work with the state to set spending targets that will increase at a fixed amount each year.\\n\\nThe plan also includes a safety valve to increase federal funding in the case of unexpected increases in enrollment.\\n\\nThe safety valve will maintain Tennessee's commitment to enroll all eligible Tennesseans with no reduction in today's benefits for beneficiaries, according to a CMS written statement.\\n\\nTennessee has committed to maintaining coverage for eligible beneficiaries and existing services while staying under the spending targets.\\n\\nIn exchange for taking on this financing approach, the state will receive a range of operating flexibilities from the federal government, as well as up to 55% of the savings generated on an annual basis when spending falls below the aggregate spending cap and the state meets certain quality targets, yet to be determined.\\n\\nThe state can spend that money on various health programs for residents, plus areas that Medicaid funding typically doesn't cover, such as improving transportation and education and employment for enrollees.\\n\\nTen years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the Trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.\\n\\nThe block grant is just another example of putting politics ahead of health care during this pandemic, says Johnson of the Tennessee Justice Center. Now is absolutely not the time to waste our energy and resources limiting who can access health care.\\n\\nState officials in Tennessee applauded the approval.\\n\\nIt's a legacy accomplishment, says Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. This new flexibility means we can work toward improving maternal health coverage and clearing the waiting list for developmentally disabled.\\n\\nThis means we will be able to make additional investments in TennCare without reduction in services and provider cuts.\\n\\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

{"original": "Why This Progressive Says She's Backing Biden In New Hampshire\\n\\nState Senator Marsha Fuller Clark tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro that she's focused on a candidate who can win over the general electorate and beat President Trump in November.\\n\\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\\n\\nDemocrats have just begun to cast their votes for who they think can take on President Trump in November. Coming up is New Hampshire, then on across the country. But where there was once a feeling of celebration at the wealth of nominees, there is now anxiety among some. No clear front-runner has emerged, even as the nominees have been winnowed down.\\n\\nJoining me now is Martha Fuller Clark. She's a state senator from Portsmouth, N.H. And she's just announced a surprising endorsement which may illuminate some of the tough calculations Democrats are making.\\n\\nWelcome to the program.\\n\\nMARTHA FULLER CLARK: Why, thank you.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: In 2016, you endorsed Bernie Sanders. He represents the progressive wing of the party. But now you are backing Joe Biden, who certainly does not. Why?\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: It's a very different election in 2020. And I think the one significant question that we as Democrats have to ask over and over again - which Democrat is best placed to beat Donald Trump? That's why I am supporting Biden.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Why did you turn away from Sanders this time?\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think that Bernie deserves a lot of credit for having changed the conversation in terms of policy within the Democratic Party. That was very strong in 2016. But what he's promising - is it really realistic to be able to achieve those goals under his administration and his leadership? I don't think that that's viable in this country at this time from what I see and what I understand.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. If you're going to pick a moderate, though, why not an Amy Klobuchar or a Pete Buttigieg?\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: I think they don't have the same level of experience as Joe Biden, and they certainly don't have the credentials with regard to foreign affairs and international policies, which are so key and at great risk with our current president. So I also think that Joe Biden is very well-liked. He's very compassionate. He has great integrity. He's trusted by voters from all different political directions. That's really important if we're going to be able to win in November.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I think what I'm hearing you say is that for you - and I will say for probably many other Democrats - your personal policy preferences are sort of being left to the side. And what is more important is what the general electorate might go for - this idea of electability - not what you might want, but maybe what the country might go for.\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: Right. And I think the country is looking for a president who is going to be able to bring us all together, regardless of our backgrounds.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But polls show that for Democrats in New Hampshire, the most important thing is not policies. It is, as you say, beating Trump. But people have very different opinions on what's needed. And do you think that's why Democrats are so fractured right now? - because each candidate has some weaknesses when you look at that equation.\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: Right. There is no perfect candidate. What we're seeing over and over again is there still is a high number of undecided voters. It may be one reason why the turnout was less than had been predicted in Iowa. I think on another level that voters are exhausted by the trauma of Washington.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: When you're in the room with other Democrats, I imagine the debates must be pretty heated. People have their preferences. What does it sound and look like? I mean, are you worried about...\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think...\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...The unity of the party?\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: No. I think everybody is unified on the issue that we cannot allow Trump a second term and that everybody is going to come together at the end of the primary with whoever the candidate is.\\n\\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We will have to wait and see. That is New Hampshire state Senator Martha Fuller Clark.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nFULLER CLARK: Thank you.\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

As he weaves through the families and shoppers, 24-year-old Waad Qannam is the center of attention.\\n\\nDana Adiq, 27, stops Qannam to call him strong, cultured and intellectual.\\n\\nTasneem Hushiyea, who is 25, asks for his plans to help young Palestinians.\\n\\nAnd 23-year-old Annas Karoty addresses him by his title: The president of Palestine.\\n\\nQannam smiles brightly, but also a little bashfully. He's not the real Palestinian president. He just played one on TV.\\n\\nIn June, he won a TV show called The President, a reality show similar to American Idol. But instead of voting for its favorite singer, the Palestinian audience voted via text message for its favorite would-be leader.\\n\\nQannam beat out a diverse mix of 23 other contestants, who held election rallies and critiqued sitting ministers. He is from East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope will be the capital of a future state, and is the son of refugees — two traits he says made him popular in the West Bank.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Schifrin/NPR Nick Schifrin/NPR\\n\\nWhen he won, he dropped to his knees and cried.\\n\\nI felt that that moment was the key to giving the youth a chance to participate in Palestinian politics, Qannam says.\\n\\nThe show, broadcast on the Maan satellite network, was popular — and he is recognized on the streets of Ramallah — in part because he's the closest Palestinians have gotten to choosing a leader in more than a decade. The real president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a five-year term.\\n\\nThe program The President sends a very strong message to the [Palestinian] leadership and says, there is a real need for the democratic process, Qannam says. The second message that it gives is the interest on the part of the youth to participate in making their ideas heard.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeventy percent of Palestinians are under 30, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, and many describe themselves as politically starved. They're frustrated not only by a lack of elections but also by a lack of political and economic development. Some accuse the Palestinian leadership of being focused only on keeping itself and its closest supporters in power.\\n\\nThose age 18 and older will get their chance to make their voices heard Oct. 8. That's when Palestinians are scheduled to hold their first contested elections in 11 years. They will choose 416 spots on local councils, which help elect mayors and other local officials and help administer services such as power and water.\\n\\nAs of now, the election will include both major parties — Fatah, which largely runs the Palestinian Authority from Ramallah, and Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States.\\n\\nBut there are no plans for either a Palestinian legislative or presidential election.\\n\\nKaroty, who met Qannam during the show's taping and considers him a friend, calls the current Palestinian leadership out of touch.\\n\\nIt is time for us to get rid of people who have been sitting for years and have not done much for the people, Karoty says. Concerning the ones that have been keeping their seats as mayors and others for many, many years, we want to get rid of those people.\\n\\nQannam — perhaps trying out a politician's answer — is more diplomatic.\\n\\nWe do not seek to cancel the role of the older generation, says Qannam, who is a member of Fatah. We rather want to encourage our role, to find a role for us.\\n\\nHe says he met with Abbas and urged him to install a quota among the municipal representatives for young members. He says he has not heard back.\\n\\nThe only time that I will feel that the youth have an impact in Palestinian politics, Qannam says, is when I see the youth of Fatah or other parties playing a practical role in the running of the affairs of the country.\\n\\nIn the nearby Amari refugee camp, 29-year-old Mohannad Samara doubts that will ever happen. Between customers at his mirror and glass shop, he explains that he's an Islamist and fears that Hamas and other Islamist groups won't be allowed to fully participate.\\n\\nThe Prophet Muhammad said our victory comes through the engagement of the youth, Samara says. But if Islamist youth gets engaged in the upcoming elections, they will either get arrested or cornered.\\n\\nHe believes the Palestinian Authority, run by Abbas, and Israel will team up to block young Islamists, either by preventing them from voting, arresting their members or not respecting the results of the vote.\\n\\nIt will be the first and foremost the Palestinian Authority that will block the youth, he says, and whatever the Palestinian Authority cannot carry out on its own, Israel will do it for them.\\n\\nOn Wednesday morning, Israel's internal security services announced it arrested Hamas' election committee representative, accusing him of being a threat to local security. Hamas accused Israel of trying to influence the election.\\n\\nQannam is trying to fight youth cynicism. He stands in a group of young Palestinians in Ramallah, and 16-year-old Jihad Adnan asks him how he will increase youth participation in politics.\\n\\nQannam tries to convince them their voices will be heard. He is only a few moments into his pitch when he's interrupted by Hushiyea. She says she is desperate to talk to any leader, even a TV president. She challenges Qannam and asks how he could prevent nepotism.\\n\\nQannam seems prepared for that question.\\n\\nThe only way to deal with the issue of nepotism, he says, is to make Palestinian institutions bigger and put the right person and the most qualified person in that job.\\n\\nHe smiles and admits he might even run himself."}
{"original": "Reporter: White House Knew Of Coronavirus' 'Major Threat,' But Response Fell Short\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\\n\\nWe're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.\\n\\nDan Diamond, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.\\n\\nDAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.\\n\\nI think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.\\n\\nThe president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.\\n\\nAnd then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.\\n\\nBut at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. As I was walking into the studio, Terry, I saw the European Union had put out a statement slamming the U.S. for taking this step without even informing them.\\n\\nGROSS: What are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.\\n\\nGROSS: We seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. The NBA suspended the season. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. So have we reached a new stage? And what does that mean?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Well, in many ways, the World Health Organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. This virus is here. It is around the world. It is spreading. It is putting many people at risk.\\n\\nBut I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. A lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the United States.\\n\\nAt the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of Americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.\\n\\nGROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?\\n\\nDIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.\\n\\nCities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.\\n\\nBut at this point, we do not have, from the White House, any clear directive on what the country should do. And with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the Trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. What went wrong?\\n\\nDIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.\\n\\nThe CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.\\n\\nGROSS: And it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.\\n\\nDIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.\\n\\nGROSS: Why didn't the U.S. use the World Health Organization's test?\\n\\nDIAMOND: If you or your listeners know the answer to that, I would love...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.\\n\\nGROSS: It's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the United States is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.\\n\\nDIAMOND: I think at this point, Terry, South Korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the United States has done in the past two months. South Korea can do 10,000 tests per day. At last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.\\n\\nGROSS: What do you think the impact is of the lost time?\\n\\nDIAMOND: I think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and I think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. We are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the United States. If there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.\\n\\nSome of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S DERVISH)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?\\n\\nDIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.\\n\\nAt the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.\\n\\nAnd I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.\\n\\nGROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?\\n\\nDIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.\\n\\nAnd when I look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. The president has driven a lot of those people away. That has weakened the response across government. It has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. And in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.\\n\\nGROSS: Are there cuts the Trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? For example, wasn't there a National Security Council health task force that was disbanded under Trump?\\n\\nDIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.\\n\\nGROSS: Something I found very interesting - and I'd love to hear your take on this - is that Tucker Carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on Fox News - he has been one of Trump's strongest advocates. And Trump seems to listen, you know, to watch Tucker Carlson's show. So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself. What do you make of that?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.\\n\\nThe president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.\\n\\nGROSS: My guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. After a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WOJCIECHOWSKI'S TWIRL)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.\\n\\nSo how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.\\n\\nDIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.\\n\\nWhat's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.\\n\\nGROSS: What is it about his management style that's so alienating?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. But his critics would say that Alex Azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.\\n\\nGROSS: My impression is that he is anti-abortion. He has described HHS as the department of life. He described the Trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. He said that in a very admiring way. How has that affected him as the leader of HHS? And was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.\\n\\nWhat that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.\\n\\nGROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.\\n\\nDIAMOND: Oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.\\n\\nGROSS: OK. Thank you for the (laughter) clarification. So how does their desire to please Trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? And that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.\\n\\nDIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nMore recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Alex Azar has been the point person on President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices. Azar has pitched himself as the fixer. He worked in the drug industry at Eli Lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.\\n\\nWhen the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, and he's been covering the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\\n\\nSo you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?\\n\\nDIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.\\n\\nBut at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.\\n\\nGROSS: Well, let's take a look at Robert Redfield, who's the head of the Centers for Disease Control. And he was a well-known AIDS researcher, and you say he was a favorite of Christian conservatives when Trump appointed him in 2018. He helped fight HIV-AIDS in Africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. Can you tell us more about that?\\n\\nDIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.\\n\\nThose views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.\\n\\nGROSS: So is there a decision, for better or worse, that Redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the U.S. for better or worse?\\n\\nDIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.\\n\\nGROSS: Vice President Pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. Seema Verma, who is the head of Medicare and Medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of Indiana. Jerome Adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the Pence administration. When Alex Azar was in Indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he became connected to Mike Pence.\\n\\nSo it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.\\n\\nDIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.\\n\\nWhile Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.\\n\\nBut I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.\\n\\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' SMALL PLANET)\\n\\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico. He investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\\n\\nIn your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?\\n\\nDIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.\\n\\nAnd the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.\\n\\nThat story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back. I'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.\\n\\nGROSS: What's another?\\n\\nDIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.\\n\\nGROSS: Like on fighting the virus, not on fighting for his job (laughter).\\n\\nDIAMOND: Yes, on fighting the threat to the American people, not fighting who has which title.\\n\\nGROSS: Is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the U.S.?\\n\\nDIAMOND: The information that I have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. One reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.\\n\\nIn a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.\\n\\nThe efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. There's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.\\n\\nGROSS: All right, well, thank you so much for your reporting, and thank you for being on our show.

{"original": "Wolf sets goal for Pa. to cut greenhouse gas emissions\\n\\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nGov. Tom Wolf has set a new goal for the state to combat climate change: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025.\\n\\nLong-term, the governor wants to see an 80-percent reduction by 2050.\\n\\nHe announced the goals Tuesday in Pittsburgh, saying they are based off the state's 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels.\\n\\nWe're about halfway there, which means we have work to do, he said.\\n\\nThe goals stem from the state's draft Climate Action Plan, released in November by the Department of Environmental Protection. The draft states that if every state and nation met comparable goals, global temperature rise could be kept below the 2-degree Celsius threshold that experts say is necessary to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change.\\n\\nIn his announcement, Wolf called for more wind and solar energy. He said he is open to beefing up the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — which requires utilities to buy certain amounts of power from alternative sources — though that would require the Republican-controlled legislature to act.\\n\\nWolf also cited recent efforts already underway to reduce emissions, such as a proposed rule to cut methane emissions from natural gas well sites and a new law bolstering in-state solar energy.\\n\\nWolf did not say whether the state should act to help the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power generation does not release carbon emissions, but it's struggling to compete with cheap natural gas and renewables.\\n\\nI haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, Wolf said.\\n\\nAsked about emissions tied to the state's growing petrochemical industry — including an ethane cracker plant under construction in Beaver County — he indicated his support for the industry.\\n\\nWolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like Shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.\\n\\nIf you want an either-or situation, I'm not your guy, he said. I want to do both. I want to have an energy efficient future, I want to have a strong environment and I want to have a good economy in Pennsylvania, and I think we can do all of those things.\\n\\nThe shift away from coal-fired electricity to natural gas power generation has helped the state achieve greenhouse gas reductions below its 2005 levels, according to the state's draft climate action plan.\\n\\nWe encourage policymakers, including Gov. Wolf, to support common-sense energy and climate-related solutions that encourage responsible natural gas production and use given the overwhelmingly clear benefits of this American resource, said David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade group for Pennsylvania's natural gas industry.\\n\\nMany environmental groups praised Wolf's emissions reduction goals, including the Environmental Defense Fund.\\n\\nAndrew Williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for EDF, said Wolf's efforts to cut methane emissions are a good step. To achieve major reductions, he said he would like to see even more action.\\n\\nThere needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.\\n\\nA program like that would set a limit on the state's emissions and allow companies to buy or sell allowances based on what they emit. Other northeast states have joined together to form a regional cap-and-trade program, but Pennsylvania is not a member.\\n\\nSome environmental groups urged the governor to be far more ambitious in setting goals. Food & Water Watch, for one, said the state should aim for 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 with significant job growth in clean energy.\\n\\nWolf on Tuesday also announced the GreenGov Council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. The council has several of its own targets:\\n\\nA 3 percent reduction in overall energy consumption per year.\\n\\nReplace 25 percent of the state car fleet with electric vehicles by 2025.\\n\\nOffset at least 40 percent of the commonwealth's annual electricity usage with renewable energy.\\n\\nEditor's Picks"}
{"original": "Trump Hosts Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\\n\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\\n\\nPresident Trump wants to see Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace deal.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There is no reason there's not peace between Israel and the Palestinians, none whatsoever.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And today, President Trump hosts Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House. We're going to talk about this with Ghaith al-Omari, who is here in our studios. He served in various positions within the Palestinian Authority. Thanks for coming by.\\n\\nGHAITH AL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Is President Trump, from a Palestinian point of view, an honest broker?\\n\\nAL-OMARI: You know, the issue of an honest broker is not an issue that the Palestinians think about too much. For the Palestinians, the U.S. is an effective broker. And that's much more important than things like honest or in certain such abstract concepts.\\n\\nINSKEEP: And so are you hopeful that President Trump is a person who could move Israelis and Palestinians toward a two-state solution or a solution? He doesn't seem to care what the solution is.\\n\\nAL-OMARI: What is very clear is that he is committed towards doing something. What is less clear is how he is going to do it. Things are complicated. The issues are complicated. There is no trust between the leaders. And on the Palestinian side, at least, there are domestic political problems that can be an obstacle and so in Israel. So unless we deal with these, I don't see how we can move forward.\\n\\nINSKEEP: I guess one of the domestic political problems is whether Mahmoud Abbas is really the leader of the Palestinians, given that Hamas has great power, and he doesn't control all the territory.\\n\\nAL-OMARI: That's one of the problems, the Hamas-PA split with Hamas controlling Gaza, the PA, the West Bank. But even within the West Bank itself, there are challenges to his legitimacy from his own political party. There has been no election for around 14 years now. So these are all issues that has to - have to be dealt with before we can actually make the difficult decisions needed for peace to be achieved.\\n\\nINSKEEP: So President Trump from the outside can seem to have evolved on this. He started out in the campaign saying, first thing when I'm elected, I'm going to move the Israeli - the embassy, the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which would effectively recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Then he backed off of that. Then he advised Israel against building more settlements. What's happening to the president?\\n\\nAL-OMARI: I think what's happening is when you sit in that office, you realize that there are complexities, there are national interest concerns that you simply don't see from the outside. And I think his policy, whether to this conflict or to the Middle East in general, has evolved as he saw the complexities and what is at stake for the United States in the region.\\n\\nINSKEEP: You think he saw the complexities. You think he actually has learned and changed here?\\n\\nAL-OMARI: What we see right now is indications that we have a more realistic, more grounded policy, at least that's the indications. Whether this will be turned into concrete policies, it's too early to tell. It's only been three months. But certainly the trajectory is very different from what we see - what we saw from Trump as a candidate versus Trump the president.\\n\\nINSKEEP: What's the role of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner?\\n\\nAL-OMARI: That's also quite vague at the moment. He's in charge of the file, but he has remained very silent about it. The day-to-day management is done by the president's peace envoy, Mr. Jason Greenblatt. Kushner remains as the overall figure. But we have not seen any direct engagement from him, so it remains a bit murky.\\n\\nINSKEEP: Assuming that this does end up as a two-state solution, if it were to, let me just ask one bottom-line question. There are people who doubt whether Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu is serious about endorsing a two-state solution even though he's formally endorsed it. Of course, the opposite question is posed to President Abbas.\\n\\nWhen I've moved around the West Bank, I see maps of Palestine - Palestine including all of Israel. Are Palestinians really ready to recognize Israel as a country, and as Israelis would want, as a Jewish state?\\n\\nAL-OMARI: I think if the right conditions are there, if the right package that includes resolution of all of the issues is there, Palestinians would be ready. Will they fall in love with Israel? Most likely not. Will we have a peace that is stable? I think so. Look at the peace that Israel had with Egypt and Jordan.\\n\\nEgyptians and Jordanians are no big fans of Israel, yet the peace itself stuck. If the two sides get their interests met - their interests for the Palestinians is about independence and dignity - they would be - you would have a stable peace deal. For the Israelis, it's about security and recognition. You get these components, you get a peace. Peace is not about love. It's about accommodation.\\n\\nINSKEEP: A cold peace, as people have said.\\n\\nAL-OMARI: A cold peace is better than a warm conflict.\\n\\nINSKEEP: OK. Ghaith al-Omari, thank you very much for coming by, really appreciate it.\\n\\nAL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nINSKEEP: He is currently with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

{"original": "Critics Say Israel's Nation State Law Discriminates Against Religious Minorities\\n\\nIsrael passed a law last month that is still causing controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. The Druze religious minority held a weekend protest.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nIsrael passed a law last month that continues to cause controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Critics say this law discriminates against religious minorities like Muslims and Christians who make up about a fifth of the Israeli population. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv, this law is sparking protest from a religious group that's one of Israel's staunchest supporters.\\n\\nDANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: The Druze religious minority in Israel held an unprecedented protest this weekend. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's main square chanting the Hebrew word for equality - shivayon (ph).\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Shivayon. Shivayon. Shivayon.\\n\\nESTRIN: The Druze are a religious group, an offshoot of Islam. They're ethnic Arabs. But unlike most other Arab citizens, they've committed to serving in the Israeli army. They get a lot of praise from Israeli leaders, and they're outspoken Israeli patriots, which is why it was unusual for the Israeli Druze community's religious leader, sheikh Moafaq Tarif, to say this at the protest.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\\n\\nMOAFAQ TARIF: (Through interpreter) Despite our unquestioned loyalty to the country, the country does not see us as equal.\\n\\nESTRIN: After impassioned debate, Israeli lawmakers narrowly passed the Nation State law last month. The law downgrades the Arabic language in Israel from official to special status and commits resources to Jewish settlement. Critics say that could lead to an unequal distribution of land and resources. Palestinian-Arab citizens have long complained of discrimination, but the Druze community's outcry is something new.\\n\\nANWAR SAEB: They put all the Jewish under this law and others out of this law.\\n\\nESTRIN: Anwar Saeb is one of the senior Druze reserve army officers leading the protest. He heads a company that produces drones for the Israeli military. He served in the army for 27 years and commanded an infantry unit.\\n\\nSAEB: I was injured three times in Lebanon, in Gaza and in the West Bank - my hand, my chest and my ears.\\n\\nESTRIN: He's part of a Druze delegation that's been meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\n\\nSAEB: I told the prime minister that we are not guests here. We are the real citizens, and we do actually the whole commitments. And we need to get all the rights.\\n\\nESTRIN: Netanyahu defended the new Nation State law yesterday.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking in Hebrew).\\n\\nESTRIN: He said the law does not infringe upon individual rights of citizens but does prevent collective national rights for non-Jews. He said the law would ensure Israel accepts Jewish immigrants while preventing Palestinian noncitizens from gaining citizenship. Israeli columnist Shmuel Rosner says many Israelis support the law, partly in reaction to international activists leading a boycott campaign against Israel.\\n\\nSHMUEL ROSNER: A sense within Israel and among many Israelis that there is a growing tendency to delegitimize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, to somehow argue that even being a nation-state is in some way not legitimate. So many Israelis feel as if Israel is under siege, and they felt the need to make a statement.\\n\\nESTRIN: Netanyahu has tried to smooth things over with the Druze community. He's proposed laws to invest in the community and to guarantee benefits for religious minorities who serve in the military. But he has not agreed to a Druze demand to amend the Nation State law with language ensuring equality for all minorities. Druze representative Saeb is torn.\\n\\nSAEB: Now the country going very, very extreme to the right. It's not good for this country. This is a democratic country. It's a great country. I want to still live in Israel. It's my country. I love this country. My son today is in the army.\\n\\nESTRIN: Druze protesters have found allies among some former top military and defense officials, including from the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies who came to this weekend's protest. The Jewish Federations of North America, a nonpartisan umbrella group of U.S. Jewish communities, offered rare criticism of Israeli policy. It says the Nation State law is, quote, a step back for all minorities. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"original": "Living Well Now: What Does It Take?\\n\\nRandall Curren is a professor of philosophy at the University of Rochester. His work spans sustainability studies, the philosophy and psychology of well-being, social and political philosophy, and ancient Greek philosophy. You can follow his work here.\\n\\nParenting, teaching and leading all require us to believe in the prospects for living well on this planet — and to have confidence in our capacity to equip others to live well without destroying those prospects for others.\\n\\nThese roles require us to both hold these beliefs and to be spokespersons for the world — ones who can make our belief in a future of opportunity credible to those we must raise, teach and lead.\\n\\nWhatever forms these endeavors might take in the absence of such credible belief and confidence, they would not succeed in their proper ends. They would not enable the human beings we influence to live well together.\\n\\nHowever, as a society we have barely begun to think about what is essential to preserving opportunity to live well.\\n\\nOur policies have been dominated by the idea that a growing economy is what best enables everyone to find happiness in their own way, even as evidence has mounted that the damaging impact of human activities on planetary systems makes the explosive economic growth of recent decades unsustainable. The emergence of sustainability science, movement toward a post-carbon economy, and greater consideration of the environmental impacts of personal and institutional decisions are all signs that we are at least beginning to come to grips with the reality that we cannot persist in destabilizing the natural systems on which humanity relies without suffering severe and ultimately irreversible consequences.\\n\\nThe recognition that preserving opportunities to live well requires preserving the integrity of the natural systems on which we rely is a critical first step. Identifying the distinct forms of human impact and critical thresholds or planetary boundaries is an important further step that has been underway for some time. Nine such boundaries have been identified, including safe rates of biodiversity loss, nitrogen removal from the atmosphere, phosphorus flowing into the oceans, consumption of freshwater, and land cover converted to cropland. From a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the Paris climate accord.\\n\\nWithin the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. A central argument of my book, Living Well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously — and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.\\n\\nA central feature of Americans' understanding and promotion of opportunity to live well has been a focused on fair terms of access to employment. Promoting fair competition for employment and equal access to the education and training needed to acquire job qualifications makes sense.\\n\\nHowever, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. The evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. Comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. Nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.\\n\\nTo make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. And we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. Those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).\\n\\nSo what is inherently involved in living well?\\n\\nIn addressing this question, my geoscientist coauthor Ellen Metzger and I have had the benefit of collaborations with psychologist colleagues, Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. Their research in self-determination theory, conducted over the course of four decades with a network of 500 collaborators in 39 countries, has found that the experience of happiness is regulated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs to feel competent, self-determining, and positively related to other people in the activities of one's life. These are universal needs, observed across all stages of life and in every culture in which studies have been conducted, and they help explain the truth in the ancient ideal of eudaimonia, or human flourishing.\\n\\nAccording to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. My work with Ryan and Deci identifies three broad forms of potential — social, intellectual, and productive/creative — the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. Fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.\\n\\nA related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. Societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. It should be evident to any observer of life in the U.S. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most Americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.\\n\\nAs counterintuitive as it may seem, we could be happier both now and in the future if we could overcome the blind faith in wealth accumulation that shaped the socially, politically and environmentally unstable world with which we must now contend."}

Framework Convention on Climate Change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. The U.S. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but Trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.\\n\\nBloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the U.N.'s climate change agency.\\n\\nWe are grateful to Bloomberg Philanthropies for this generous contribution, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a news release about the funding pledge.\\n\\nWhile government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\\n\\nThe announcement follows Trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that nearly 200 nations agreed to in late 2015. As NPR has reported, the only other countries not part of the agreement are Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which argued that the Paris accord did not go far enough to curb global emissions.\\n\\nThe architects of the Paris Agreement included Christiana Figueres, who until recently led the UNFCCC.\\n\\nAfter the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris deal sparked pledges of money and solidarity, Figueres said via Twitter on Friday, Thank you Trump. You have provoked an unparalleled wave of support for Paris and determined resolve on climate action. Deeply grateful."}

Mitt Romney has cleared the path for his Republican colleagues to intensify their investigation next week into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter.\\n\\nThe Utah Republican said Friday that he'll go along with his fellow members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and authorize a subpoena as part of an investigation into what Republicans call potential conflicts of interest from Biden's tenure in office.\\n\\nRomney had wavered about joining the other Republicans on the panel, who control the majority but would have needed him to break a tie if all the Democrats present opposed a subpoena.\\n\\nOn Friday, a spokeswoman said that Romney and Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the committee, reached an accord that made Romney comfortable with going along.\\n\\nSenator Romney has expressed his concerns to Chairman Johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle, said spokeswoman Liz Johnson. He will therefore vote to let the chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.\\n\\nJohnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have been seeking interviews with witnesses and documents about Hunter Biden for several months. They've contacted the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and a political consultancy, Blue Star Strategies — among others — with requests for responses.\\n\\nJohnson and Grassley, who is not on the homeland security committee, have said they haven't gotten satisfactory responses to their formal requests, which is why Johnson's committee is expected to begin issuing subpoenas now that Romney is on board.\\n\\nJohnson wants to subpoena records and an interview from Andrii Telizhenko, a former consultant for Blue Star. The Wisconsin senator says he wants to find out more about accounts that Blue Star, which represented Ukraine, sought access to Hunter Biden in order to gain access to Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time, and to influence the State Department.\\n\\nThe Republicans' latest actions putting the Biden investigation back into the spotlight have followed Joe Biden's successes in the Democratic primaries, reviving his prospects of becoming the party's presidential nominee.\\n\\nThe Burisma connection\\n\\nHunter Biden made lucrative business connections at a time when Joe Biden was handling key foreign policy matters for President Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe younger Biden was paid as a member of the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and also received payments and, reportedly, gifts from Chinese business counterparts.\\n\\nThe Bidens traveled together to China aboard Air Force Two during the time Joe Biden was vice president. Johnson and Grassley also have asked DHS, which oversees the Secret Service, whether it has records about other trips they might have made.\\n\\nJoe Biden's campaign has been embarrassed by the consistent exhumations about that story, but the men haven't been accused of any lawbreaking.\\n\\nTrump's desire for Ukraine to launch an investigation into the Bidens' activities was one basis for the actions in the Ukraine affair for which he was impeached last year and then acquitted earlier this year.\\n\\nRomney has played a key role all throughout as one of a handful of Republicans who've been willing to break with Trump.

He's slated to start Jan. 19.\\n\\nNaming Austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.\\n\\nThe auditors had several recommendations, such as calling on Facebook to do more to rein in hateful speech on its platform, and stricter penalties for users who post items that violate company standards.\\n\\nThe auditors also advised Facebook to create a position to lead the company's efforts on civil rights, even after acknowledging the company had taken several positive steps in that direction. Those included barring advertisers from using tools that target housing, employment and credit ads at individuals based on gender, age or ZIP code.\\n\\nI am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, Austin said in a statement.\\n\\nTechnology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it's important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it, he added.\\n\\nFacebook said Austin will be based out of Washington, D.C.\\n\\nHe comes from the law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, where he was a partner focusing on criminal defense and civil rights law. Earlier in his career, Austin held several positions within the U.S. Justice Department, including senior assistant U.S. attorney in the Civil Rights Unit of the Washington, D.C., U.S Attorney's office, and deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from 2010 to 2014.\\n\\nAfter that Austin worked on the White House Domestic Policy Council in the Obama administration.

{"original": "President-Elect Trump Eyes Rex Tillerson As Possible Secretary Of State\\n\\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\\n\\nThis weekend, reports emerged saying the CIA believes Russian hacking during the U.S. presidential election was intended to sway the election in favor of Donald Trump. The president-elect had this to say on Fox News this morning.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP: I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know why. And I think it's just, you know, they talk about all sorts of things. Every week, it's another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\\n\\nCHANG: Joining us now to talk more about Russian hacking and Trump's possible pick for secretary of state is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara.\\n\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.\\n\\nCHANG: So what do you make of Trump's reaction to the latest news on the Russian hacking?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, it was pretty extraordinary. He rejected the consensus view of the intelligence community, that Russia wasn't just interfering in the elections to sow chaos, actually trying to put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump. He put out an official statement - not a tweet - where he insulted the intelligence community, said these are the same people who brought us flawed intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction. He also suggested this morning that President Obama might be trying to undercut his win, which, although it was decisive and even stunning, it was certainly not historic landslide, as Trump just described it, because his 306 electoral votes rank him 46th out of 58 Electoral College victories.\\n\\nThe other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. He said in that interview on Fox, he says I'm a very smart person. I don't need briefings every day. I don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. And that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about China or North Korea or Iran? Is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?\\n\\nCHANG: There was also some reaction from Congress this morning. We saw a statement from a bipartisan group of senators. They said this is not a partisan issue. What do you make of that?\\n\\nLIASSON: Well, what I make of it is there's not only a big breach between Trump and the intelligence community. There's also a breach between Trump and a bipartisan group of senators on Capitol Hill who say there should be hearings. There was the initial reaction from some Republicans where they didn't want to undermine Trump's victory, but other Republicans want to get to the bottom of this. They consider this a cyberattack. They don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. We also have the report that the Obama administration has asked for to be completed before Obama leaves office. That means it would probably come out right before Trump's inauguration.\\n\\nCHANG: OK. So now let's talk about the secretary of state nomination. The front-runner now, according to multiple news outlets, is oil executive Rex Tillerson. He's the CEO of ExxonMobil. No confirmation yet, but if Trump chooses Tillerson, what would that say about his foreign policy plans, and what does that signal to the rest of the world?\\n\\nLIASSON: I think it signals that he might be ready to break with 70 years of bipartisan foreign policy consensus about America's role in the world. Rex Tillerson has been described as the most friendliest-to-Putin American executive. Runs ExxonMobil - ExxonMobil would benefit, of course, if sanctions against Russia for taking Crimea were lifted. Vladimir Putin personally gave Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013. And I think it's raising some alarm bells on the Hill. We have Lindsey Graham and John McCain, two Republican senators, suggesting that Tillerson might have the hardest time of all the Trump national security nominations up in the Senate. They're going to ask him some very tough questions about Russia.\\n\\nCHANG: NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
