Sheldon Adelson, Conservative Donor And Casino Titan, Dies At 87\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUpdated at 12:27 p.m. ET\n\nCasino magnate Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific donors in conservative politics, died Monday night at the age of 87 due to complications from treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to a statement from Las Vegas Sands, the company he founded.\n\nAdelson made his fortune — a net worth of around $35 billion according to an estimate by Forbes — in the casino hotel industry. He spent much of it backing conservative politicians in the U.S. and Israel, shaping the political debate of both countries.\n\nHe was in the first wave of superwealthy Americans to take advantage of the Supreme Court's controversial Citizens United ruling, which opened the doors to eight- and nine-figure political donations so long as the money goes to independent superPACs and not candidates or party committees.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP\n\nSerial entrepreneur\n\nAdelson grew up poor in Dorchester, Mass. His parents were immigrants. His father drove a cab.\n\nWhen I was 12, I bought my first business, said Adelson, who started out selling newspapers on the street. He told the story during a videotaped court deposition in 2008. You know, you hold the newspaper in your hand and say, 'Hey, get your Daily Record.' We would yell that out. We would hawk newspapers, Adelson said.\n\nBy age 16, he had bought his second business — vending machines. And he kept on selling — packages of toiletries, spray cans of windshield de-icer. He ran a tour business and got into venture capital.\n\nThen, early in the personal computer era, he bought an influential computer trade show called Comdex and held it in Las Vegas.\n\nComdex took off, so Adelson bought the legendary Sands Hotel and Casino and built a million-square-foot convention center behind it. It was the start of a new Las Vegas, a place that catered to big conventions all week long — not just the weekend crowd that came in for gambling and the shows.\n\nI think if you had to single out one individual who brought that kind of component to the city, it would be Sheldon Adelson, said Sig Rogich, a longtime Las Vegas communications consultant. He was a transformational figure in Las Vegas history.\n\nIn 1996, Adelson imploded the Sands and built the Venetian, a complex with more than 8,000 rooms and more than 150 stores and restaurants. It's a model that he replicated in Macau and Singapore with enormous profit.\n\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, and you can't get rid of it. So that's what I did, Adelson told the American Gaming Association convention in 2014.\n\nAlong the way, Adelson had battles. In the Comdex days, he fought the other casino owners. When he put up the Venetian, he froze out the unions that had represented workers at the old Sands.\n\nAnybody who stands up to him or stands in his way, he'll try to crush, said D. Taylor, international president of the labor group UNITE HERE and a long time labor leader in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2015, the Adelson family bought the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper, in a sale originally shrouded in mystery and investigated by the publication's own journalists. There were several newsroom resignations after that sale, including a columnist who was told he could not write about Adelson.\n\nThe Adelson primary\n\nThe fortune Adelson made in the casino business was spent generously on donations to Jewish causes, medical research and the Republican Party. He and his wife, Miriam, gave around $500 million over the past eight years to Republican and conservative campaigns.\n\nThe couple's prolific political giving led to what was sometimes called the Adelson primary, in which GOP presidential hopefuls would flock to Las Vegas to court Adelson and the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\nHey, listen, Sheldon, thanks for inviting me, said then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich at one such event in 2014. I don't travel to these things much, but this is one that I thought was really, really important.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential primaries, Adelson initially appeared to back Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who received the endorsement of Adelson's Review-Journal. Unlike Rubio, Donald Trump said he didn't need Adelson's money. If Sheldon gives to him, he'll have total control over Rubio, and that's the problem with the way the system works, said Trump in an interview with Fox News.\n\nBut after early reservations, the Adelsons backed Trump's 2016 election effort; they gave $5 million to his inaugural committee and then donated about $500,000 to the legal defense fund for his White House aides. During the 2018 midterms, the Adelsons donated more than $100 million to Republicans.\n\nTrump awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018; the citation praised her work and philanthropy in combating addiction. You have been truly incredible, Trump told her at the event, before looking out to the crowd. Here to celebrate Miriam's award is Sheldon. Where is Sheldon? Where is Sheldon? Where is he? There he is. Oh, you didn't make the front row. He's probably angry.\n\nIn statement Tuesday, Trump said, His ingenuity, genius, and creativity earned him immense wealth, but his character and philanthropic generosity his great name. Sheldon was also a staunch supporter of our great ally the State of Israel.\n\nWhile Adelson was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party, he wasn't always in sync with the party's positions, telling reporters in 2012, On the social issues, I'm not pro-life; I'm pro-choice.\n\nAdelson continued to support Trump in his reelection bid, though about a week after the election, his newspaper's editorial board said the defeated president was trying to delay the inevitable. The editorial column blasted the unfounded claims of voter fraud Trump and his allies were perpetuating.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBirthright Israel; Jerusalem embassy\n\nAdelson also spent heavily on conservative causes in Israel.\n\nHe was a primary backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a biography of the Israeli leader by journalist Anshel Pfeffer, Netanyahu helped the Adelsons secure unprecedented access to hold their wedding reception in the Israeli parliament building.\n\nIn 2007, Adelson launched Israel Today, a free daily that has become Israel's largest circulation newspaper. It features cheerleading coverage of Netanyahu and his family, a key asset in Netanyahu's longtime quest for positive press coverage in Israel. When Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress in 2015 against the Iran nuclear deal, Adelson was in the gallery.\n\nAdelson also helped bankroll Birthright Israel, a program partially funded by the Israeli government to send Jewish youth from around the world to Israel on free guided trips.\n\nHe was a forceful advocate for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Adelson heavily supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign in part because of his support for moving the embassy.\n\nWhile the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations rejected such a move, Trump's administration embraced the policy.\n\nAdelson even offered to pay for at least part of the cost of building a new embassy.\n\nAt the dedication ceremony for the new embassy in May 2018, the Adelsons sat in the front row just a few feet away from Netanyahu, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nNPR international correspondent Daniel Estrin contributed reporting to this story.
Democrats Want To Work On A Sound Border System, Rep. Thompson Says\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump made a case last night that he is not against immigrants. He says he is against those who break the law.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nINSKEEP: The president made that case from behind his desk in the Oval Office. It was a pose, before the cameras, that predecessors since Harry Truman have assumed. In this case, the president was demanding a border wall as his price for reopening parts of the government. Those listening to the speech included our next guest. He is Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. He is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which means he is the newly empowered chairman.\n\nMr. Chairman, good morning.\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you accept the President's contention there that illegal immigration is a drag on the country?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, I think, first of all, you have to say that the president didn't give us anything new. We have a problem with immigration, but we can fix it. What we're dealing with now, though, is a manufactured problem created by some policies implemented by this administration that has actually put a greater strain on our system of immigration.\n\nINSKEEP: Let me make sure I understand there. You say there's a real problem and a manufactured problem. Define the real problem, please.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, the problem is we have about 13 million people in this country who are here, in one form or another, illegally - visa overstays or what have you. But this notion that those individuals are terrorists, those individuals are murderers, robbers - very few of them. Our experience and information lead us to believe that many of them are just hardworking people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. Our system of immigration in this country needs fixing. And so what we're trying to say to the president is, you don't have to fan the flames of hysteria to fix an immigration system. You just need to do it. A wall won't fix an immigration system. Common sense, listening to the professionals who say technology and some other things is the way to go is how you begin the process of fixing an immigration system. So...\n\nINSKEEP: Now, the president is correct, though, that there are people who cross the border illegally or who arrive seeking asylum. And as you know, there has been an increase recently in the number of unaccompanied minors and families coming to the border. And in his speech last night, the president argued that a border wall is not just better for citizens, in his view, it's also better for migrants if they're deterred from coming. Let's listen to some of that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\n\nTRUMP: This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States - a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, Mr. Chairman, this is something the Obama administration could have said. And in fact, they did say this is a very dangerous journey, it's hazardous for people, it would be better for many if they didn't come. Is the president right?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. We wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. So what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. Teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. So what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. So again, let me be very clear. Democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.\n\nINSKEEP: Is homeland security at risk because of the shutdown? There are Coast Guard and other homeland security personnel who are not being paid even though they are working.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no real correlation between border security and this shutdown. The president has tried to manufacture and up the ante by this shutdown. We have some 800,000 employees. We have 450 airports in this country manned by TSA workers who may or may not get paid this Friday. That's not how you run an effective system of national security for those who travel. Our Coast Guard individuals, as you know, recently got paid because of a unique formula for handling the money. I'm not certain that they will be able to do it next time. Those men and women of TSA and the Coast Guard do a wonderful job.\n\nINSKEEP: So is homeland security at greater risk because of that situation?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question they're at risk because the morale of people working at airports - and they are some of the lowest-paid people in the system. And so now we are doing this to them. My comment is - Mr. President, put the people back to work so we can keep America safe.\n\nINSKEEP: Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciated talking to you.\n\nTHOMPSON: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: Bennie Thompson of Mississippi chairs the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Lehigh University Revokes President Trump's Honorary Degree\n\nLehigh University has revoked an honorary degree that President Trump held for more than 30 years. The Pennsylvania school's board of trustees held a special vote this week after Trump incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe decision came after a special session of the Executive Committee on Thursday and was fully affirmed earlier today, student newspaper The Brown and White reported.\n\nNumerous petitions had previously sought to rescind the honor for Trump, who was awarded the degree when he spoke at the school's commencement ceremony in 1988.\n\nThree years ago, one such effort garnered nearly 80,000 signatures. That petition drive also presented a point-by-point argument that accused the president of falling short of the university's values.\n\nThis individual should reflect the goals and values of Lehigh University, the petition noted, quoting the school's official policy for commencement speakers, who are routinely awarded honorary degrees. Nominees should be someone whose work and achievements reflect our value system at Lehigh.\n\nOn Thursday, Lehigh University President John Simon issued a statement calling the events at the Capitol a violent assault on U.S. democracy, the will of the American people and the transfer of power.\n\nIn response to those words, several alumni and faculty members renewed their call for the school to rescind Trump's honorary degree, posting a link to a new online petition.
In 2005, Trump Was Hit With A Tax That He Now Wants To Abolish\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nPresident Trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.\n\nA two-page tax return, filed by Trump for 2005 and revealed Tuesday, may suggest one reason. Because of the AMT, Trump was required to pay about $38 million in taxes on income of more than $150 million that year.\n\nWithout it, Trump's bill would have been a lot lower.\n\nThe AMT, which Trump has proposed eliminating, operates as a sort of parallel tax: If you claim too many of the wrong kind of deductions and try to get by with paying too little, you automatically find yourself bumped into the world of the AMT, where different rules — and higher rates — apply.\n\nIn other words, if you thought you were going to lower your tax bill by claiming a lot of deductions, think again.\n\nThe AMT was passed into law in 1969, amid public outrage over reports that some 155 ultrawealthy people had escaped paying federal taxes altogether by using loopholes and tax shelters, says Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut over time, it has morphed and changed and now sucks in a lot of taxpayers who are merely very comfortable.\n\nIt is a stupid tax. It's poorly targeted, Burman says.\n\nThe people most likely to be hit with the AMT are not billionaires, but people earning incomes of $500,000 to $1 million a year. Burman says 62 percent of them are expected to pay the tax in 2017.\n\nOf those who earn between $200,000 and $500,000 a year, 31 percent will pay the tax.\n\nBut among those making more than $1 million a year, only 18 percent get hit.\n\nThat's because the AMT tends to kick in for certain kinds of deductions more than others.\n\nIf you live in a high-tax place such as New Jersey or New York and deduct the state and local taxes you pay, that deduction will be counted toward the AMT. The same goes for people who claim children and other dependents as personal exemptions.\n\nBut the types of deductions favored by the ultrawealthy, such as tax shelters, don't get counted, Burman says. Income from capital gains also gets preferential treatment under the AMT.\n\nThat means someone like Warren Buffett, who gets most of his income from stock investments, can pay a very low rate without triggering the AMT, while a well-paid executive from Westchester County with lots of kids probably can't.\n\nWhy Trump got hit by the AMT in 2005 isn't clear without more details than were included in the two-page return released Tuesday night by journalist David Cay Johnston.\n\nThere are a bunch of technical preferences that can throw you onto the AMT, and it looks like Donald Trump fell afoul of one or two of them, Burman says.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the AMT meant Trump had to pay much higher taxes than he otherwise would.\n\nWithout the alternative minimum tax, Donald Trump would have paid a lower tax rate in 2005 than the poorest half of Americans — just 3.48 percent — despite income of more than $150 million. Trump wants to abolish the AMT. Now we know why, said Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente.\n\nTrump is by no means the first politician to take aim at the AMT. In fact, economists, tax lawyers and members of Congress have long discussed abolishing or reforming it.\n\nBut it's never happened, in part because it raises too much money. The AMT is projected to bring in some $40 billion to $50 billion a year to the federal government over the next decade.
Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed\n\nRachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nI'm joined now by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. He was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign. Scott, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.\n\nMARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.\n\nJENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.\n\nMARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?\n\nJENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.\n\nMARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...\n\nMARTIN: Although...\n\nJENNINGS: ...And gets us past this issue.\n\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.\n\nMARTIN: Which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. Republican strategist Scott Jennings for us this morning.\n\nScott, thanks, as always. We appreciate it.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you very much.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Tax The Ultrarich To Solve Poverty? Easier Said Than Done\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nichole Sobecki for NPR Nichole Sobecki for NPR\n\nA new report from Oxfam says that just 1 percent of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' fortune — estimated at $112 billion — would cover Ethiopia's entire annual health budget. That's health care for 105 million people.\n\nSo, Oxfam proposes, let's tax the rich to help the poor.\n\nIt's not a new idea. In fact, Oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity — $8.4 trillion in 2018 — with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity — $1.4 trillion. The reports coincide with the World Economic Forum, where elites gather in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.\n\nThe latest report — published on Monday and called Public Good or Private Wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. In 2017, it was 43 individuals.\n\nBut would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?\n\nOxfam thinks so. Its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to U.N. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.\n\nThe rich are doing very well — thank you very much — and those on the wrong end are working harder and harder for less and less everywhere we look, says Paul O'Brien, Oxfam America's vice president for policy and advocacy.\n\nReducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, Oxfam argues.\n\nAnd that's certainly a pressing issue. Even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the World Bank has warned that progress is slowing. What's more worrying, according to Oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to Forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.\n\nBut is a global wealth tax realistic?\n\nO'Brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. But he is optimistic about the odds. Major agencies like the International Monetary Fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the World Economic Forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.\n\nBut until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. The Oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.\n\nAccording to Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.\n\nFor example, a couple of years ago, the Tax Justice Network worked with the Australian Taxation Office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through Singapore. Oil and gas giant Chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.\n\nProper taxation is important, but it's one thing among many that we need to do to address poverty, says Vijaya Ramachandran, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\n\nRamachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. The Oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.\n\nCash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. The idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. The stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThen there are what Harvard Business School professor and co-author of The Prosperity Paradox Clayton Christensen calls market-creating innovations. Christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. But outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.\n\nOn the other hand, Christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in Mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. These types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.\n\nWhether through a global wealth tax or other practices, Oxfam's O'Brien just wants to see inequality reduced now.\n\nHopefully, we won't have to talk next year, he told me, because we'll have solved global extreme inequality!\n\nJoanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequality.

Despite Frigid Weather, The Snow In Pyeongchang Is Fake\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\nIf you've been watching the Winter Games on TV, you may have noticed there's not a lot of snow in Pyeongchang. While the South Korean region is known for its frigid winters, major snowstorms are rare in February.\n\nThat's where Snow Making Inc. (SMI), comes in. The Michigan-based company has installed snow-making machines at seven Winter Olympics, including Pyeongchang.\n\nDepending on which venue it is, we estimate between 90 and 98 percent of the snow that's there has been machine-made and produced in advance of the games, Joe VanderKelen, president of SMI, tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson.\n\nThe Games' organizers spent nearly $6 million to bring in snow cannons, which push cold water and pressurized air through a snow gun to produce artificial snow. At past Olympics in Sochi and Vancouver, the host cities also deployed fake snow on mountain ranges due to unseasonably warmer weather.\n\nMachine-made snow is like one-week or two-week-old natural snow that's been sitting there and takes a while to go into a different grain size, and actually can become a better surface once it's tilled for the athletes, VanderKelen says.\n\nSurprisingly, athletes prefer manufactured snow because it is more consistent, he adds. When preparing the courses, organizers will actually push off natural snow before spreading the fake stuff.\n\nThe racers like a very hard surface that minimizes rutting, so that between the 40 and 60 competitors that might race they're trying to keep that surface as consistent as they can as they carve those gates and those corners, VanderKelen says. So they really like a very hard surface, and they don't like natural snow at all.\n\nSMI's fully automated snow-making system consists of 100 snow cannons posted on towers and carriages at the Jeongseon Alpine Center, according the company's website. The entire system can store up to 33.6 million gallons of water, which is enough to fill 51 Olympic-size swimming pools.\n\nTake the Jeongseon Alpine venue. We've had people over there since early November, and they pretty much made snow from November 15 until about January 10, VanderKelen says. They converted around 200 million gallons of water into snow during that time and then stored it until the games began.\n\nThe next host of the Winter Olympics, Beijing, will almost completely depend on man-made snow, according to a 2015 report by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThere would be no opportunity to haul snow from higher elevations for contingency maintenance to the race courses so a contingency plan would rely on stockpiled man-made snow, the IOC wrote, a month before it designated Beijing the 2022 host.\n\nThough harmful to the environment, the technology behind man-made show has become more energy efficient, VanderKelen says.\n\nThe end result for the mountain resorts around the world is they're making a lot more snow, a lot more efficiently, at a lot warmer temperatures, for a lot less money, he says.\n\nBut a lack of snowfall has proven harmful to the commercial ski industry. A low-snow year can cost the U.S. winter sports industry up to $1 billion, according to a report by Protect Our Winters, a climate advocacy nonprofit. Less snow can deter people from hitting the slopes and delay the start of the season.\n\nSnow is currency, Auden Schendler, vice president of sustainability at Aspen Ski Resorts and a Protect Our Winters board member told NPR. Snowmaking is a stop gap, it's an insurance policy. But it doesn't replace the natural product.

Pope Francis Accuses Bishop's Critics Of Slander, Riling Sex Abuse Victims In Chile\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPope Francis has accused victims of sexual abuse in Chile of slander, saying their attacks on a bishop who's accused of covering up the abuse amount to calumny. The remarks triggered anger and demonstrations in Chile, where several churches have been firebombed in the past week.\n\nOn the last day of his visit to Chile, Francis set the simmering resentment some hold against the Catholic Church to a full boil with his defense of Bishop Juan Barros. The bishop has been hotly criticized ever since the pope appointed him in 2015. Barros was the protégé of Rev. Fernando Karadima, a notorious disgraced priest who served in the southern city of Osorno and who was found guilty and dismissed in 2011 for abusing dozens of minors over a decades-long period beginning in the 1980s.\n\nKaradima became the face of the church's sexual abuse scandal in Chile. And his victims say they believe Barros knew about the priest's abuse but did nothing to stop it or report it. As recently as this week, Barros has denied witnessing any abuse.\n\nIn trying to reconcile his church with its followers over decades of sexual abuse, the pope has embraced a zero tolerance policy. When a Chilean journalist asked Francis about Barros, the Associated Press reports, Francis replied, The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I'll speak.\n\nHe added, There is not one shred of proof against him. It's all calumny. Is that clear?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters\n\nThe comment immediately set off a backlash, with abuse victims speaking out on Twitter and elsewhere, with many saying the statement echoed the skepticism and denial that had met with their claims. One victim, Juan Carlos Cruz, replied, As if one could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others while Barros stood by.\n\nAdding to the drama, the exchange took place one week after the Associated Press reportedly Francis had written a letter in January of 2015 about the Vatican's attempt to cope with the fallout from Karadima. In it, the agency said, Francis acknowledged the controversy around Barros and referred to a previous plan to ask for Barros' resignation.\n\nOn Thursday, the pope's remarks dismissing Barros' critics came in Iquique, where the controversial bishop was on hand as Francis celebrated a mass at a beach.\n\nWith Pope Francis' visit to Chile now over, the newspaper Clarin is calling it the worst of his five years as pope, citing his remarks about Barros and comparatively low turnouts for Francis' public events in the country.\n\nDays earlier, Francis had asked for forgiveness and sought to heal old wounds over the Church's handling of abuse. On the first day of his visit to Chile, he spoke of the pain and shame, that I feel at the irreparable damage caused to children by ministers of the Church.\n\nShortly after making that statement on Tuesday, Francis met with a small group of victims of sexual abuse in Santiago, in a meeting at which the Vatican says the pope listened to them and prayed and cried with them.\n\nAt least five Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week, some with firebombs. The attacks have also included vandalism and graffiti, including accusations and threats against Pope Francis. After spending several days in Chile, the pope is now in Peru on the next stage of his tour.
Senate Leader McConnell Condemns GOP Objections To Election Results\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who worked for Sen. Mitch McConnell, about the outgoing majority leader, and the GOP's response to the mob that broke into the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nTwo Senate elections in Georgia have given Democrats control of the United States Senate. That means that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell loses his post after six years in power. McConnell's final act as majority leader is proving to be his response to the president's continuing attack on democracy.\n\nWhen Joe Biden's win became clear in early November, Mitch McConnell stood on the Senate floor. Instead of congratulating the obvious winner, he gave a carefully worded statement. He did not repeat the president's false claims of fraud but did say the formal process should play out.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.\n\nINSKEEP: Six weeks later, in mid-December, Joe Biden's win was confirmed after every legal challenge failed. McConnell then spoke again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.\n\nINSKEEP: In recent days, McConnell tried to prevent Congress from debating the baseless claims of fraud in yesterday's session, but it was not until yesterday that McConnell forcefully and in detail refuted the president's election claims as completely baseless. He added that Congress was no place to litigate them.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts and the states - they've all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.\n\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell said his vote to override objections to this election was the most important vote of his 36 years in Congress. As he spoke, insurrectionists were already descending on the Capitol. They briefly disrupted the proceedings, although they resumed and were completed overnight.\n\nScott Jennings is with us now. He is a Republican strategist who has worked with Mitch McConnell over the years. Mr. Jennings, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Thanks and good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell's speech yesterday was really quite powerful, but I have to ask if it was a mistake for him to wait two months to give it.\n\nJENNINGS: Well, he works at the speed of the institution. I mean, I think most Republicans said after the election that if Donald Trump had issues with the votes that he should take it to court. That's the proper venue for the adjudication of claims. He did that. Every single court that looked at it did not agree. The Electoral College met. And that's immediately when Mitch McConnell acknowledged that Joe Biden was the president-elect. And then yesterday, after the president would not stop indulging this fantasy that the election was stolen, Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor and made a powerful speech. And I thought, frankly, it was one of his finest hours. It's regrettable that he had to actually give that speech.\n\nDonald Trump is the cause of everything that happened yesterday. Some people stood tall, and some people gave in to it still. And I thought McConnell was one of those that stood tall.\n\nINSKEEP: You're exactly correct that McConnell did not give in to it yesterday, but I do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. Mitch McConnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. He did not always support the president. On a number of occasions, he criticized the president. But there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. Should he have said more sooner?\n\nJENNINGS: I think the president over the years had an agenda, and Mitch McConnell felt like that as the Republican leader, it was his job to try to help the president get outcomes on that agenda. He did that and, frankly, did it pretty faithfully and did get some outcomes for the president that I'm not sure he could've gotten without Mitch McConnell's skill in legislative maneuvering.\n\nBut, look; once the election was over and the claims had been adjudicated and the votes were counted, Mitch McConnell stuck by the institution and the norms and the gears of our democracy. And he was not about to let Donald Trump live in an alternate bubble. And I think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. And he - and - you know, convinced most of the Republicans in the Senate that the Republicans should not indulge what Donald Trump was doing. It's, I think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.\n\nBut I thought McConnell did what he did on the calendar of the institution, according to the gears of our democracy. Wasn't fast enough for some people, but he did it. And I think the message that he gave was exactly the right one.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's hear one of those who indulged the president yesterday, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Even after the violence and the disruption in the Capitol, when senators came back in and the House of Representatives came back in, he spoke on the Senate floor last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOSH HAWLEY: We do need an investigation into irregularities, fraud. We do need a way forward together. We need election security reforms. I bet my friends on the other side of the aisle don't disagree with that.\n\nINSKEEP: Which was a common theme of the people who supported the president here. They didn't repeat the president's lies quite so much as just saying, look; there are allegations we should investigate. But this is an obvious cynical ploy. Why do you think a large part of the party was addicted to that?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. And to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. The president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. These things are decided in the courts and at the state level. And to go on the Senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. They wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.\n\nAfter the insurrection, Hawley and Cruz and the rest had every opportunity and every reason to say, this has gone far enough. And the fact that they plowed forward and pushed it into the middle of the night still, I thought, was a disgrace to the institution and, frankly, a disgrace to the Republican Party.\n\nINSKEEP: So Mitch McConnell now becomes the minority leader, but I'm not even sure that's exactly the right term when it's a 50-50 Senate and Kamala Harris, the vice president, is necessary to break ties. So he will still be in a very powerful position, but not dictating the schedule of the institution. Do you think that he anticipates using his power to work with the new president, oppose the new president? What?\n\nJENNINGS: You know, I think they'll have a power-sharing agreement akin to what happened several years ago in a 50-50 Senate. Democrats will have control of the floor. It'll make it easier for Joe Biden to form his government. I don't think Republicans intend to try to stop Biden from forming a government. But certainly, they're not going to lay down their conservative principles.\n\nAnd I think McConnell's view is in a closely divided government, policy ought to be made between the 40-yard lines. I do think he considers Joe Biden a friend. He was the only Senate Republican to go to Beau Biden's funeral. I think he thinks there are areas where they can work together. And after what happened yesterday...\n\nINSKEEP: About 10 seconds.\n\nJENNINGS: ...I hope it was a wake-up call to everybody in Washington that living in this fantasy alternate reality has to stop because there are real consequences.\n\nINSKEEP: Republican strategist Scott Jennings, it's always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.\n\nJENNINGS: Thanks, Steve.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHRISTIAN SCOTT'S DANZIGER)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

How The Trump Campaign Weakened The Republican Platform On Aid To Ukraine\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the questions raised over the course of this year's presidential race is about how a President Trump would deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne reason to wonder: the Republican Party platform's new language on policy towards Ukraine.\n\nWhen Republican Party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in Cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of then-presumptive nominee Donald Trump on most issues — except when it came to a future Republican administration's stance on Ukraine.\n\nIt started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U.S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian government, which is fighting a separatist insurrection backed by Russia. Denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.\n\nDenman is a long time GOP activist from Texas. When she presented her proposal during a platform subcommittee meeting last month, two gentleman, whom Denman said were part of the Trump campaign, came over, looked at the language, and asked that it be set aside for further review.\n\nShe says after further discussion the pair had to make some calls and clear it. She says they found the language was still too strong.\n\nThe Trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change Denman's proposal. It went from calling on the U.S. to provide Ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.\n\nIt's more than semantics. Many Republicans have been demanding the Obama administration provide a more robust response to Russia's incursions in Ukraine.\n\nDenman was steam rolled, said Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC, think tank, who believes the language the Trump campaign approved is weaker. And she says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.\n\nHaring was referring to Trumps appearance on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos last month, when Trump said Vladimir Putin is not going to go into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he's not going to go into Ukraine.\n\nOf course, Russia did go into Ukraine when it invaded Crimea two years ago and backed separatist fighters in other parts of the country. Trump later said that he meant Putin would not go into Ukraine on his watch, if he were President.\n\nStill, that comment raised eyebrows, especially combined with his campaign chairman Paul Manafort's past work for deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally.\n\nAnother GOP delegate on the platform committee, Rachel Hoff, is a national security analyst with the American Action Forum and believe the final platform language signals that a Trump administration would refuse to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine.\n\nThis puts Trump out of step certainly with Republican leadership but I would also say mainstream conservative foreign policy or national security opinion, Hoff said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have approved providing arms to the Ukrainian government but the White House has resisted, saying that it would only encourage more bloodshed.\n\nIt's a rare Obama administration policy that the Trump campaign seems to agree with.
Former Defense Sec. William Cohen On Trump's 'Tough' Foreign Policy Rhetoric\n\nFormer Defense Secretary and GOP Sen. William Cohen talks with Steve Inskeep about the Trump administration's approach to the world, as reflected in recent actions and phone calls with world leaders.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nLet's try to make sense of the way President Trump talks about other countries.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nRussia is seen as undermining U.S. interests around the world, but the president speaks of a new and better relationship.\n\nINSKEEP: Australia is among the most vital U.S. allies, and the president harangued the prime minister by phone.\n\nMARTIN: Then there's Iran, China and North Korea. The president talks of getting tougher on all of them.\n\nINSKEEP: And when North Korea talked of testing ballistic missiles that could reach the United States, Trump tweeted, it won't happen. That got former Clinton-era Defense Secretary William Cohen wondering what step is next.\n\nWILLIAM COHEN: Well, it's one thing to talk tough about North Korea. The question is does the president have a policy in mind in terms of how he's going to alter the conduct that is currently being carried on because you can't tell what the North Korean leader might do in response to either verbal or rhetorical threats coming from the administration. So you have to take care.\n\nINSKEEP: Cohen is Republican, once a senator from Maine, and he worries about possible Russian influence on the president. He says President Trump's hints at dropping sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine could undermine longtime alliances.\n\nCOHEN: It may be that President Trump is fulfilling his negotiating strategy by setting out an extreme position and then having it walk back to something that's more responsible. If it is and it works, OK, he'll get credit for that. But to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.\n\nINSKEEP: You're saying that he could inadvertently encourage Russian aggression, inadvertently encourage North Korean aggression because those countries might get the idea that the United States is not really truly standing behind its allies.\n\nCOHEN: Or they may fear that he's about to take preemptive action, in which case they might try to preempt that. What I'm saying is that the president of the United States needs to take more care about what is said and how it's said.\n\nINSKEEP: I think we could recite the White House defense ourselves now. Why are you so bothered by this? It's refreshing the way that he talks. He's speaking his mind. People like that. What's wrong with that line of thinking?\n\nCOHEN: Well, it takes a long time to build an alliance. It can be destroyed very quickly. And it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what I would call, like a blind Samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of World War II. Those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera. If you take down the pillars, what replaces it?\n\nINSKEEP: Is the danger of war involving the United States greater than it was?\n\nCOHEN: Well, you have people like former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry now writing that his biggest fear is we're going to have a nuclear explosion in his lifetime. That's worrisome.\n\nINSKEEP: Why would that be more likely?\n\nCOHEN: Well, because the notion of nuclear weapons has been what we call normalized - this is just another weapon.\n\nINSKEEP: Remarks that the president made while campaigning.\n\nCOHEN: Yeah. The notion that proliferation of nuclear weaponry may be in the overall interests of the world I think contravenes every notion that we've had since the bomb was created.\n\nINSKEEP: I want to be as clear as we can that the president, I think, if you talk about inviting Japan to get nuclear weapons, he said different things. I think he may have even denied that he ever said the thing that he had in fact previously said. So he seems to have backed off. But it sounds like you're just arguing that that uncertainty about what the president means is the problem.\n\nCOHEN: The uncertainty and the notion that is so cavalierly discussed. With the amount of nuclear weaponry in existence today, the life of this planet is at stake. So it's really incumbent on all of us to find ways to prevent something accidental from taking place because the consequences are existential for us.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the president's tough talk to adversaries or potential enemies really that much different than other presidents? I'm thinking about the way that President Obama, before the Iran nuclear deal, made a blanket statement - Iran's not going to get a nuclear weapon. It would have been hard to mistake that as anything but a threat.\n\nCOHEN: Well, you have to put it in the context of President Obama and how he conducted himself throughout his eight years of the presidency. Every instinct on his part was to find ways not to talk belligerently or to take action. In fact, Ronald Reagan talked tough as well, but people had a sense of how Ronald Reagan was going to govern. President Trump comes in with no government experience in a - and accustomed to communicating in a manner which doesn't lend itself to accountability. So is this a way to conduct policy? I don't think so. But, you know, he's president and we're not.\n\nINSKEEP: William Cohen was a Republican senator and defense secretary under President Bill Clinton.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

The Republican Party After Trump\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nJust a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.\n\nWhat is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you.\n\nSIMON: I feel like I have to put it this bluntly. Has the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ed Brooke become the party of the Proud Boys and Confederate flags and racism?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.\n\nSIMON: But before you go on, Washington Post/ABC poll says nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want to follow Trump's lead.\n\nCOSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.\n\nSIMON: From your point of view, Mr. Costello, does the Republican Party need to renounce Donald Trump?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.\n\nAnd some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.\n\nSIMON: And - well, I have to ask, Mr. Costello, and I know polls can go up and down, but if more than half of the people who identify themselves as Republicans say the party ought to support Donald Trump, after all that's happened, he's still a Republican. Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?\n\nCOSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.\n\nBut to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.\n\nSIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?\n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.\n\nTo me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.\n\nAnd so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.\n\nSIMON: Ryan Costello is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Thanks so much, sir.\n\nCOSTELLO: Thank you very much. Take care.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

For These Families, Vouchers Bring A Needed Change\n\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\n\nDorothy, of Spring Hill, Fla., has a 15-year-old son with spina bifida and developmental delays, and her 13-year-old daughter is, she says, mildly autistic. Neither was happy at public school.\n\nMy son was in a lockdown classroom with gang members. It was a bad situation. I was afraid he was going to get hurt, Dorothy says. My daughter was getting bullied because she spoke out of turn or would get upset easily. Twenty kids in a classroom was a lot for her.\n\nToday, Dorothy is homeschooling her son and daughter with the help of a novel item on the school choice menu: the Gardiner Scholarship. This voucher program, created in 2014, can be used by students with specific disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. It has grown rapidly and is now used by 7,000 Florida students.\n\nA controversial education bill now before Florida's governor, Rick Scott, would add $30 million to the program's budget, amid other expansions to school choice.\n\nUsing the Gardiner, which provides an average $10,000 for each child, Dorothy has been able to purchase tablet computers, a camera, a telescope, books, online courses and other supplies and equipment to customize a curriculum for both teenagers.\n\nThey are doing better than I ever could have imagined, says Dorothy (we're not using her last name to protect her children's privacy). Neither take any [psychiatric] medication anymore. There are no overstimulation issues.\n\nOnly a few other states, including New Hampshire and North Carolina, support homeschoolers. Compared with charter school choice or private school vouchers, these programs give families the widest possible leeway to customize their children's education while still receiving public support to pay for it.\n\nPresident Trump has shed a spotlight on this idea. His 100-day plan mentioned redirect[ing] education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. However, some in the homeschooling movement oppose vouchers. The Home School Legal Defense Association has called them a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.\n\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\n\nCompared with other states, Florida has some of the stricter accountability requirements for homeschooling families, whether they use the Gardiner or not. They include maintaining a portfolio of student work, which is subject to inspection at any time by the district superintendent, and submitting an annual evaluation of student work, which can take the form of a state test.\n\nThe Gardiner has an additional layer of review. Amy Graham is the senior policy director for Step Up For Students, the nonprofit which administers the Gardiner. The group's role includes verifying that the expenditures that parents submit actually serve educational needs. We've had a variety of things that have been denied, she says, such as toys or entertainment videos.\n\nI spoke with four families using the Gardiner, and all said it was working out better for them than conventional school. Ewan, 14, lives in Merritt Island on Florida's Space Coast. He has autism and a passion for science. But, he struggled to adjust to public school. He once walked out of his kindergarten class, crossing six lanes of traffic, intending to go home for lunch.\n\nThe worst part for him was the noise. I hate the sound of children being loud. I just want to rip my hair out, he says. His school tried to help, giving him headphones to amplify the teacher's voice and cancel out background sounds. But that made it even more difficult than it already was to connect with peers.\n\nBy sixth grade, Ewan was placed in a class with students who had significant cognitive challenges. But, he told his parents and his teachers in a meeting, I just want to learn what everyone else is learning. His parents took him out and enrolled him in Florida Virtual School, an online charter program. With the ability to study in peace and quiet, and rewind and re-watch lectures, his mother says his grades went from Fs and Cs to As and Bs within one marking period.\n\nAfter a few years, seeking even more customization, his parents applied for the Gardiner. Now Ewan makes his own schedule, attending astronomy lectures at nearby universities, studying German, sampling free online college courses and learning to take photographs and use his own telescope. He is blowing me away with some of the stuff he is understanding, says his mother, Alicia. And that is because of the Gardiner.\n\nThe Gardiner is not a good fit for every special-needs student. Alicia points out that $10,000 doesn't go a long way for students who might need speech, occupational or behavioral therapy on a daily or weekly basis, as Ewan did when he was younger. In Dorothy's case, her children's therapies are paid for by Medicaid, because she adopted them from medical foster care. But, a lot of parents who do have children with more complex needs are still left in limbo, Alicia says.\n\nAccepting the Gardiner prohibits families from double-dipping into services or even extracurricular activities provided at public schools, says Amy Graham at Step Up For Students. A cross-check is done to make sure they aren't enrolled in public school.\n\nAnd homeschooling is only an economic option in the first place for families in which at least one parent has a flexible schedule. Both Alicia and Dorothy work from home while supervising their teenagers.\n\nAs we pointed out previously in NPR Ed's school choice series, special-needs families who accept private school vouchers often give up their federal rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This includes the right to a Free Appropriate Public Education, or FAPE.\n\nThe same is true of the Gardiner, says Amy Graham. We have language in the Gardiner Scholarship law that says that by participating in the Gardiner Program you're not allowed to have FAPE. You're giving that up. The state will still evaluate students, but if families take them out of the system, they are no longer eligible for services.\n\nAlicia, Ewan's mother, says that's a choice that families shouldn't have to make. Florida is all about school choice, says Alicia. But it's only a choice where the choices are equally beneficial for a student. Otherwise we're being herded into a decision.\n\nStill, for families like Dorothy's and Alicia's, the tradeoff is worth it. So, too, for Tracy, a mother in Citrus County, Fla.\n\nTracy's son, now 17, has an autism diagnosis and loves computer programming. We had a long, long fight with the public schools before the Gardiner came out, she says. Often the behavioral plans weren't followed. [Other students] beat him up and threatened to kill him... The school took his assistive devices and gave them to other children.\n\nToday, Tracy says, he is studying video game design with the help of a high-speed computer and online courses, all paid for by the Gardiner.
Pentagon Considers Canceling Program That Recruits Immigrant Soldiers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Pentagon is considering pulling out of a deal it made with thousands of noncitizen recruits with specialized skills: Join the military and we'll put you on the fast track to citizenship.\n\nThe proposal to dismantle the program would cancel enlistment contracts for many of the foreign-born recruits, leaving about 1,000 of them without legal protection from deportation.\n\nThe plan under consideration is laid out in a memo from Pentagon officials to Defense Secretary James Mattis. In the memo, obtained by NPR, high-level personnel and intelligence officials cite security concerns and inadequate vetting of recruits under a program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI.\n\nThe memo also cites the potential threat posed by individuals who may have a higher risk of connections to Foreign Intelligence Services, and it refers to an elevated risk of an insider threat.\n\nThe recruitment program began in 2009 to attract immigrants with medical or language skills, such as surgeons or Arabic speakers. It allows visa holders, asylees and refugees to bypass the green card process to become U.S. citizens.\n\nThe founder of the MAVNI program, retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, said the security concerns are overblown. If you were a bad guy who wanted to infiltrate the Army, you wouldn't risk the many levels of vetting required in this program, she said.\n\nNoncitizens have had a long history in the U.S. military. Immigrants have been eligible to enlist since the Revolutionary War.\n\nThree Defense Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the memo publicly, said the Pentagon is trying to balance national security concerns with the military's needs for specialized skills immigrants can provide. In some cases, the officials said, the Army wasn't using the program as intended, putting MAVNI recruits in roles that didn't match their skills.\n\nNearly 10,000 immigrants are in the MAVNI program, principally the Army, according to the Pentagon memo. The memo divides them into four groups based on their potential security risk, as determined by their level of vetting and their access to classified information.\n\nSome already are serving in the military and have been flagged for enhanced security screenings, while others are awaiting basic training and would be separated from the military or have their enlistment contracts canceled.\n\nAbout 1,000 of the recruits who have been awaiting naturalization would be at risk of deportation because their visas have expired. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had deferred action on deportation in these cases because the soldiers were in the MAVNI program.\n\nThe program has been frozen pending further review.\n\nQuestions about the program arose last year when officials discovered that some MAVNI recruits had offered false educational credentials, according to a legal brief from the Department of Justice. The brief was filed as part of a lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's decision to freeze the program.\n\nThe Pentagon responded to the discovery of some recruits providing fake university degrees by ordering security checks on all recruits in the program and barring new enlistments.\n\nBut that screening process has overwhelmed the Army's resources. According to the Pentagon memo, those security checks have diverted already constrained Army fiscal and manpower resources from their primary roles.\n\nStock said many MAVNI recruits were left in limbo.\n\nThe Army said you can ship to basic training after you complete the background checks. But now they've canceled all the background checks so nobody can ship to basic training, she said.\n\nIn one of two ongoing lawsuits, several noncitizens recruited under MAVNI and serving in the Army Reserve have sued. They argue that they were promised an expedited path to citizenship but that the Department of Homeland Security, at the behest of the Pentagon, has failed to process their naturalization applications, as required by law.\n\nIn the other case, the plaintiffs argue the Pentagon discriminated against naturalized U.S. citizens who were denied security clearances in the first terms of their enlistment. That meant that the military careers of the MAVNI recruits were effectively stalled out because they were unable to attend officer training school, for instance.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, Kirti Tiwari, is a native of India, with a master's degree in molecular biology. He was selected as an Army nominee for NASA's astronaut program, but that plan was put on hold when Tiwari couldn't get a security clearance in his first term of enlistment.\n\nThe Pentagon has since changed that policy, but plaintiffs' attorney Neil T. O'Donnell said naturalized citizen soldiers still face discrimination because some haven't been allowed to enter basic training.\n\nIn the memo, the Pentagon acknowledges that freezing the MAVNI program and subjecting recruits to more screening could be legally problematic. For example, some of the recruits are already naturalized citizens who have been deployed around the globe. There are significant legal constraints to subjecting this population to enhanced screening without an individualized assessment of cause, the memo states.\n\nThe memo also suggests devising a public affairs strategy before canceling enlistment contracts.\n\nStock, the founder of the program, said the proposal outlined in the memo could be a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThey're subjecting this whole entire group of people to this extreme vetting, and it's not based on any individual suspicion of any of these people. They've passed all kinds of security checks already. That in itself is unconstitutional, she said.
Pompeo Won't Say Whether He Owes Yovanovitch An Apology. 'I've Done What's Right'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated on Saturday at 3:01 p.m.\n\nWith the State Department facing continued questions over the treatment of Marie Yovanovitch before she was recalled as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would not say on Friday whether he owed the career diplomat an apology.\n\nI've defended every single person on this team, Pompeo said in an interview with NPR. I've done what's right for every single person on this team.\n\nPressed on whether he could point to specific remarks in which he defended Yovanovitch, Pompeo responded, I've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.\n\nThe exchange with Mary Louise Kelly, co-host of All Things Considered, follows the release by House Democrats last week of messages suggesting that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance in the days before she was told to return to Washington from her posting in Kyiv last year.\n\nThe messages were sent between Robert Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate and fervent Trump supporter, and Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. He was indicted in October on campaign finance charges.\n\nParnas has emerged as a central figure in efforts by Giuliani to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate political rivals of Trump. That campaign is now the focus of the ongoing impeachment trial against Trump in the Senate.\n\nPossible surveillance of a U.S. ambassador\n\nThe State Department itself is now investigating the possible surveillance of Yovanovitch, who during testimony before House impeachment investigators in November said she had felt threatened by Trump. Before her recall, Yovanovitch had been accused of disloyalty by allies of the White House, and during his now-infamous July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said of Yovanovitch, She's going to go through some things.\n\nIn an interview last week with the conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, Pompeo said he never heard that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance. In her testimony before the House, Yovanovitch said she was told by the State Department that she was being recalled because of concerns about her security.\n\nPompeo has come under criticism — including, at times, from career diplomats in his own department — for failing to more forcefully defend Yovanovitch in the face of political attacks. During testimony before impeachment investigators, for example, Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, said he resigned from the department in part over what he interpreted to be a lack of public support for Department employees.\n\nI'm not going to comment on things that Mr. McKinley may have said, Pompeo said on Friday. But he dismissed the suggestion that a shadow foreign policy involving Ukraine was in place.\n\nThe Ukraine policy has been run from the Department of State for the entire time that I have been here, and our policy was very clear, Pompeo said.\n\nImmediately after the questions on Ukraine, the interview concluded. Pompeo stood, leaned in and silently glared at Kelly for several seconds before leaving the room.\n\nA few moments later, an aide asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo's private living room at the State Department without a recorder. The aide did not say the ensuing exchange would be off the record.\n\nInside the room, Pompeo shouted his displeasure at being questioned about Ukraine and asked Kelly to identify the country on a map, which she did. He used repeated expletives, according to Kelly, and asked, Do you think Americans care about Ukraine? He then said, People will hear about this.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Pompeo disputed NPR's account of the interaction.\n\nNPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record, he said. It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, NPR Senior Vice President for News Nancy Barnes said, Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran\n\nThe interview began with a series of questions about the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. Pompeo defended the president's maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, saying it is absolutely working.\n\nThis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. And the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program, Pompeo said in reference to the international agreement signed by Iran, the U.S., the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in 2015. It was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off.\n\nAs the nation's chief diplomat, Pompeo has played a central role in shaping the president's more aggressive posture toward Iran. It's a policy Pompeo has described as reestablishing deterrence.\n\nThe policy has taken many forms. Less than two weeks after Pompeo was sworn in as secretary of state in 2018, Trump announced the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. The announcement was followed by the reinstatement of steep economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nUnder Pompeo, the State Department has also designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time the U.S. has given that label to the branch of another government.\n\nYet perhaps no action has been more controversial than the administration's decision this month to launch the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's influential Quds Force, outside the airport in Baghdad. While the administration has declined to offer specifics about the intelligence that prompted the strike, Pompeo has defended the president's order, saying it was carried out in response to an imminent threat of attack on U.S. embassies.\n\nFor days, the killing revived fears of an all-out war. Iran retaliated with strikes against two bases housing American troops in Iraq. No Americans died in the attack, though the U.S. military later revealed that 34 service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nTensions have since eased, but the episode has renewed questions about whether the president's maximum pressure campaign has emboldened Tehran. Since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, Iran has shot down a U.S. drone, targeted oil tankers in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, and been blamed for a debilitating attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nAt the same time, Iran has stepped away from key provisions of the nuclear deal. In an interview this month with NPR, the country's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said all limits on centrifuges used to enrich uranium are now suspended.\n\nHe's blustering, Pompeo said in Friday's interview. This is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today.\n\nThe secretary declined, however, to detail specifics of the administration's policy for preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, saying only, We'll stop them.\n\nPompeo would not say whether direct U.S. engagement is taking place with Iran but did say the administration has built a coalition that's working to put pressure on Iran to end its missile program, its processing of uranium and the reprocessing of plutonium.\n\nHe said the U.S. has also raised the cost for Iran's use of force through proxy groups in the Middle East.\n\nThis is beginning to place real choices in front of the Iranian regime, Pompeo said. You can see in the protests inside of Iran. You can see the Iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. All the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the American people are coming to fruition as a direct result of President Trump's strategy.\n\nHe would not comment on whether a new deal is being developed in order to prevent Tehran from acquiring a weapon, but instead said, The economic, military and diplomatic deterrence that we have put in place will deliver that outcome.\n\nThe Iranian leadership will have to make the decision about what its behavior is going to be, he said.
Despite Huge Backlogs, The Government Shutdown Halts Most Immigration Court Hearings\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP\n\nThe federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.\n\nCourt appointments scheduled during the shutdown will be reset to new dates in the future, per a notice from the Department of Justice dated Dec. 26. The only exception are courts operating in immigration detention centers, where federal immigration authorities hold immigrants pending deportation. However, court staff may not be paid while continuing to hear those cases.\n\nIn addition, some emergency motions in nondetained cases can still be filed to the judges that are working during the shutdown.\n\nShutting down the country's massive system of immigration courts will gum up an already congested judicial process, immigration judges and attorneys say.\n\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled.\n\nIn federal immigration court, judges often hear cases in quick succession, a process some have compared to hearing death penalty cases heard in traffic court settings. A swift deportation may become a death sentence if a person is forced to return to a violent homeland.\n\nEach day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in Los Angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.\n\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled, she said.\n\nCalls to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.\n\nIn recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the U.S. has swelled, as processing times lagged. The average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles statistics on U.S. immigration. That's up from 430 days a decade ago.\n\nSome administration officials and immigration hard-liners have criticized long processing times as contributing to practices that allow immigrants without strong cases to stay in the U.S. for years, rather than be swiftly deported.\n\nTo try to move cases through more quickly, the Trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. However, under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. If reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.\n\nBoth policies drew criticism from judges such as Tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.\n\nIt's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration, she said, referring to President Trump's desire for funding additional barriers at U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.\n\nRescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. For others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise, said Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz.\n\nFor example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. Or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the U.S. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.\n\nEvery immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said Philadelphia immigration attorney Matthew Archambeault. In either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.\n\nThe thing I tell them is, something's going on, their hearings may not go forward, but to prepare like they're going to go forward, said Archambeault. I don't get into it too much.
COVID-19 Supply Deal Lets Vaccine Maker Earmark Doses For Employees And Their Families\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nAs the nation grapples with a slower-than-promised coronavirus vaccine rollout, one federal deal to increase factory capacity includes an unusual condition: the manufacturer would be allowed to earmark doses to vaccinate employees and their families, giving them an opportunity to skip the line that public health policymakers have been crafting for months.\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's push to make a COVID-19 vaccine available in record time, added $628 million to a federal contract with Emergent BioSolutions, a Maryland-based contract manufacturer, to advance manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine as well as therapeutics, the Department of Health and Human Services announced in June.\n\nThe company has also inked separate deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine doses for AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, all three of which are part of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nAccording to Emergent's federal contract, the company can keep a reasonable quantity of vaccines to inoculate its employees and critical subcontractors, and their respective immediate families.\n\nIt's a unique and ethically fraught clause that doesn't appear in any of the other Operation Warp Speed contracts NPR has reviewed. Although the contract doesn't explicitly state that the company will vaccinate its workers ahead of people at higher risk of COVID-19, it could have that effect. And extending vaccination to family members heightened concerns that the provision would mean delays for other people prioritized for immunization.\n\nWhile vaccine manufacturers are no doubt essential, placing their workers in the highest risk group and allowing their families to get the vaccine at the same time they do is problematic, says bioethicist Ruth Faden, the founding director of the Berman Institute for Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University. She is also a member of the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts' Working Group on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nI am unaware of any context in which the family members of a critical class of workers have been included along with that critical class, Faden says. So let's take our health workers, right? Have you heard any discussion that immediate family members of even frontline health workers should get vaccines?\n\nIt's a rhetorical question.\n\nI haven't ... and that's because it doesn't pass an ethics smell test — as much as my heart breaks for the family members of health workers who have had to worry about what their loved ones are risking, she says. There are many more people at greater risk, for whom a stronger ethical case can be made.\n\nThere's a limit on how many doses Emergent can retain, but it's been redacted from the document. The contract says the company will also have to pay for the doses.\n\nWhen asked about the clause, the federal government and Emergent say company employees and their families won't get to cut in front of other people in line for the vaccine.\n\nVaccine manufacturers should coordinate with their state for any prioritization, according to the state's plans, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told NPR in an email. The HHS spokesperson didn't answer our question about how this part of the Operation Warp Speed contract came about.\n\nIt is expected that Emergent's employees will receive COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with the vaccine distribution plans of the states in which they reside, says Emergent spokesperson Nina DeLorenzo.\n\nThe company didn't answer NPR's follow-up question: If that's so, what's the point of the clause in the contract at all? Emergent's response was a restatement of the previous answer.\n\nBased on a review of the contract clause, Ameet Sarpatwari, assistant director of Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law, says it is intended to allow employees and their family members to get vaccinated when the company wants, regardless of public health officials' vaccine rollout queue.\n\nThe only reason that clause is in there is that they considered the possibility of jumping the queue and it allows them the option of doing so, he says, adding that Emergent's insistence that it intends for its employees to wait their turn doesn't mean much.\n\nI think the federal government did a disservice to the public at large, many of whom are wondering when they are going to get their vaccine and in some cases if they are going to get the vaccine by agreeing to this clause, he says.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices worked throughout 2020 to hammer out recommendations for who should get the COVID-19 vaccine and when. The CDC recommends prioritizing health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities before vaccinating front line essential workers like firefighters, for example. States then made their own plans based on the CDC's guidance.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration said that states should immediately make COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone 65 and older as well as people with health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. That's a change over previous recommendations to prioritize certain essential workers and people over 75 years old in the next phase of vaccination.\n\nSarpatwari says companies shouldn't be able to use their contracts to jump ahead in the queue policymakers designed because the decision as to who gets this scarce resource is already so ethically fraught.\n\nEvery dose matters right now, and we're trying to get them into the hands or into the arms of the people who need it the most, he says. And there's not a strong case that these are the people who need it the most.\n\nEmergent isn't the only vaccine maker that has looked at ways for its staff and their families to get access to shots.\n\nModerna has a different plan for immunizing a range of employees and affiliates, though it doesn't appear in the company's Operation Warp Speed contract.\n\nModerna announced Dec. 29 that it would be vaccinating board members, employees, contractors and their adult household members to provide an additional layer of COVID-19 protection and to reduce the risk of absenteeism and disruption due to a COVID-19 infection in an adult household member. Participating is voluntary, paid for by Moderna and separate from the 200 million doses the federal government has already agreed to purchase.\n\nFor transparency, the Company notified appropriate health authorities about the program in advance and is participating in all relevant monitoring and reporting obligations under the Emergency Use Authorization, Moderna said in a press release.\n\nModerna employees will sidestep state vaccine prioritization plans. But instead of cutting the line, the company is creating its own separate line with a small number of additional doses not available to the general public.\n\nThe supply is in addition to the commitments to the US, so the supply actually increases the capacity and number of individuals in [the] US who can be vaccinated, and in effect speeds up vaccination for those not in Moderna's program, Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan told NPR.\n\nPublic Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, first told NPR about the clause in Emergent's contract. Zain Rizvi, a law and policy researcher focused on pharmaceuticals at the organization has been combing through the Operation Warp Speed contracts for months. This one was posted as part of an Emergent financial filing. Others have been harder to come by because the federal government has been slow to respond to public records requests.\n\nIt just raises questions about the government deal-making process and what information the government is actually disclosing to the public as well, Rizvi says. I think it's a perfect example of why the government needs to be much more transparent when it comes to the terms of its deals with these giant pharmaceutical corporations.\n\nYou can contact NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin at slupkin@npr.org.
Omissions On Death Certificates Lead To Undercounting Of Opioid Overdoses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media\n\nIn a refrigerator in the coroner's office in Marion County, Ind., rows of vials await testing. They contain blood, urine and vitreous, the fluid collected from inside a human eye.\n\nIn overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.\n\nWe send that off to a toxicology lab to be tested for what we call drugs of abuse, said Alfie Ballew, deputy coroner. The results often include drugs such as cocaine, heroin, fentanyl or prescription pharmaceuticals.\n\nAfter testing, coroners typically write the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate — but not always.\n\nStandards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. As a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. The country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in February in the journal Addiction.\n\nWe have a real crisis, and one of the things we need to invest in, if we're going to make progress, is getting better information, said Christopher Ruhm, the author of the paper and a health economist at the University of Virginia.\n\nData from death certificates move from coroners and medical examiners to states and eventually the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes reports on overdose counts across the U.S. According to the CDC, more than 42,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2016, a 30 percent increase from the year before.\n\nBut that number is only as good as the data states submit to the CDC. Ruhm said the real number of opioid overdose deaths is closer to 50,000. He came to the higher estimate through an analysis of overdoses that weren't linked to specific drugs.\n\nOn a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. In some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said Ruhm. In the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.\n\nSome states do worse than others. In 14 states, between 20 and 48 percent of all overdose deaths weren't attributed to specific drugs in 2016, according to a breakdown from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nMany overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, Ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. According to Ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, Indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. He estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.\n\nIn some states such as Indiana, independent county coroners investigate deaths. Coroners are usually elected, and they aren't necessarily medical professionals. Other states, though, have medical examiners, who are doctors. Some even have a chief medical examiner who oversees death investigations for the whole state.\n\nStates that have centralized oversight with medical examiners tend to do better than those with coroners, said Ruhm.\n\nIn some places, death investigators don't list substances on a death certificate because they haven't tested for them. Brad Ray, a policy researcher at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said toxicology reports cost hundreds of dollars each, which could strain county budgets.\n\nAdditionally, toxicology reports are currently optional for Indiana coroners. So if you're not required to pay for it, and you're not required to report it, why would you? said Ray.\n\nIndiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and Gov. Eric Holcomb is expected to sign it. Starting in July, coroners will have to run toxicology screens and report the results to the state health department. The state will also help cover the added costs.\n\nMore accurate data will likely make the opioid problem look worse as the numbers go up. But Ray said realistic data could help the state access federal funds to tackle the opioid epidemic and keep better track of drug problems.\n\nSo we can see when trends are happening. We can see when there tend to be increases in cocaine and meth and decreases in opioids, if that happens, said Ray.\n\nMarion County's Ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. Her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.\n\nWe'll say 'drug overdose' or 'drug intoxication,' and then we identify the drugs, she said. So if it's five drugs that have caused or contributed to the death, then we put those five drugs down.\n\nBallew plans to travel the state and train other coroners to do it the same way.\n\nThis story was produced by Side Effects Public Media, a reporting collaborative focused on public health, in partnership with NPR and Kaiser Health News.

Twitter Suspends Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Account\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTwitter locked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene out of her account on the social media platform on Sunday, citing violations of a company policy that it recently used to remove thousands of QAnon-related accounts. The suspension is in effect for 12 hours.\n\nGreene has repeatedly endorsed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which has sought to portray President Trump as being undermined by a deep-state cabal.\n\nWhen reached on Sunday, a Twitter spokesperson told NPR that the Georgia Republican's account has been temporarily locked out for multiple violations of our civic integrity policy.\n\nThe company's policy was updated after the recent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — a deadly event during which Greene and others were seen not wearing face masks in a secure room where a crowd of people were sheltering.\n\nGreene's account is still viewable to the public. The newly elected representative's most recent messages on the platform repeat false claims that elections that resulted in Trump's defeat and key Republican losses in the Senate were flawed. Key election officials in Georgia, she said, had been begged by Republicans to fix our elections.\n\nTwitter affixed a warning notice to Greene's message about the recent national election stating, This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can't be replied to, Retweeted or liked to a risk of violence. Those limits on engagement were introduced as part of the social media company's new approach to messages that are deemed to violate its civic integrity policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Twitter announced that it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts that were used to share content about QAnon.
Biden's Plan To Release More Vaccine Is A Gamble. Is It Worth The Risk?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is planning to take a dramatic step aimed at increasing the amount of vaccine available to states.\n\nHis transition team says he'll change a Trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.\n\nInstead, the Biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. For people who've gotten initial shots, the Biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.\n\nThe two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.\n\nAccording to CDC, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.\n\nThe President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.\n\nSome public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health — who advises both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration on the federal COVID-19 response — tells NPR there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.\n\nThe Biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. They are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. They feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.\n\nThe Biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.\n\nWe have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, Biden's incoming press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing Friday. The president-elect has said he will use the Defense Production Act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.\n\nHowever, Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the Trump administration, defends its current policy.\n\nIf President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.\n\nA key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.\n\nThe head of the Association of Immunization Managers, Claire Hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. The goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. Get it, thaw it, give it. [Then] order the second dose. Don't try to store it at CDC, don't try to store it at McKesson.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that this is a good move. He says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.\n\nAs the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, Lipsitch says.\n\nThere is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. This is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.\n\nThe danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. It could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.\n\nRasmussen and others worry that a weak immune response could actually lead to the virus developing new mutations that are even more dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement earlier this week confirming the importance of the booster shots.\n\nBut many approve of the Biden policy announced Friday.\n\nThis strategy makes tons of sense, Dr. Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco wrote in an email to NPR. We know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.\n\nDr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials or ASTHO, calls the Biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. The big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.\n\nOur hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.\n\nIf it turns out there are production issues down the line, the Biden decision could be reversed, suggests Julie Swann, a supply chain expert and professor at North Carolina State University.\n\nI think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [If] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.\n\nPien Huang contributed to this report.
6 Takeaways From President Biden's Inauguration\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden.\n\nThat's going to take some getting used to after these past four years.\n\nThe new president was sworn in Wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. Biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing Americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the U.S. faces, as he sees it.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Biden's inauguration:\n\n1. A starkly different tone was set.\n\nIf there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that Biden struck. Gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of Donald Trump. Instead, America saw a staid and humble President Biden. Instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.\n\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, Biden said. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.\n\nFor a significant portion of the country, Biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the Trump presidency. Some Republicans even praised his speech. For another large group of Americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.\n\nOverall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to COVID-19 and threats, it seemed like Washington was headed for something of a return to normal.\n\nFor a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the U.S. Capitol on the first three Wednesdays of this January: one of the Jan. 6 violence, one of Trump's impeachment and then one of Biden's inauguration.\n\n2. Real unity will be tough to come by.\n\nTrying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, Biden did something Trump rarely did — reach out to those who didn't vote for him. And he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all.\n\nTo all those who did not support us, Biden said, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n\nCertainly, this was no Trump American carnage speech. But tone is one thing, and policy is another.\n\nA return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but only very narrowly. Biden will likely need Republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.\n\nAnd it won't solve the problem of the tens of millions of Trump supporters who are fed and believe a daily diet of false information — and who make up the base of the Republican Party.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n3. Biden laid out his priorities.\n\nSpeaking of those priorities, Biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in America. They include addressing COVID-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. He is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address.\n\nBiden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. But you can bet that Republicans will find plenty to disagree with Democrats about in how to solve those issues. And what of unity then? More importantly, what of solving those issues when Biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of Republican opposition?\n\nBiden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more.\n\nBut there's only so far those executive orders can go.\n\n4. Truth matters again.\n\nWhen hearing of Trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many Trump supporters dismissed the criticism that Trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: Oh, come on. All politicians lie.\n\nWell, not like what was seen these past four years. Trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to The Washington Post. That's an average of 20 per day.\n\nWhat usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. Then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. But Trump could not be shamed.\n\nThe news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. And Biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. But there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.\n\n5. Inaugurations may have changed permanently.\n\nBiden got out of the presidential limo and walked hand in hand with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, to the White House. For a brief moment, in a tight shot on television, it could have all looked like any other inauguration.\n\nBut it was not. The walk was drastically curtailed and more heavily guarded compared with past presidential inaugurations. And while there were some people on the street during the walk, there weren't throngs of people lining the streets.\n\nIt's very likely that inaugurations as we knew them have changed permanently. There may be a return of people to the National Mall and even a parade when the coronavirus pandemic finally clears.\n\nBut from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events.\n\n6. The presidency is overwhelming — for anyone.\n\nDespite his decades serving as a senator in Washington and even his eight years as vice president, Biden was clearly moved by the reality of his new position.\n\nTrump even appeared cowed Wednesday by leaving it. On Trump's exit from the White House, he stopped to talk to reporters. He looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind — and even thanked the media.\n\nAfter walking up to the White House, Biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. He then hugged his wife and held the embrace. They took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.
Gov. Wolf just set a lofty climate goal. What will it take to get there?\n\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf kicked off the new year with an ambitious climate change goal: reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.\n\nPennsylvania is the nation's fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. If cutting emissions to arrive at Wolf's targets is achievable, it will require a host of strategies.\n\n\n\nOne involves far more electric vehicles on the road. In the Pittsburgh area, less than 1 percent of car sales are electric, said Sarah Olexsak, manager of transportation electrification for Duquesne Light.\n\nThe power utility began greening its own fleet in 2017, purchasing electric sedans and trucks to use in lieu of ones powered by gasoline or diesel.\n\nStanding next to one of the electric trucks recently, Olexsak paused to listen to a faint stream of white noise emanating from it.\n\nThis is all you're going to hear, the sound of the fan and the batteries, she said.\n\nThat's less of a nuisance for residents when workers are fixing nearby lines. Plus, there are zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nDuquesne Light is also working with parking authorities and local businesses to help install chargers for the public, offering guidance on where to place them and whether to require payment for their use.\n\nYour car is going to sit eight-plus hours a day at a work site, Olexsak said. It's a great place to charge up.\n\nBetter planning and incentives to increase electric vehicle use would result in significant greenhouse gas reductions for Pennsylvania. That's one suggestion for cutting emissions included in the state's most recent blueprint for addressing climate change, the draft of its Climate Action Plan released by the Department of Environmental Protection every three years.\n\nWolf based his new climate goals off models identified in the plan, which use 2005 as a baseline year for emission levels. As coal-fired power plants shut down amid competition from cleaner natural gas and renewables, Pennsylvania is already halfway to his 2025 target.\n\nMaking that goal is feasible, said Carnegie Mellon University professor Jay Apt, a director of the school's electric industry center.\n\nWolf has joined other governors in setting similar short- and long-range targets.\n\nThe idea of having a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2050 will inform choices that we make now because energy investments are very long-lived, Apt said.\n\nA gas power plant, for example, will operate for decades.\n\nThat's a big shadow that an investment today casts, Apt said. Having a goal now that articulates out 30 years into the future is quite reasonable.\n\nMany in the environmental community were glad to see the governor set ambitious targets.\n\nIt's absolutely the goal we need, but the market by itself is not going to get us there. We really need to do it through policy, said Mark Szybist, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nEstablishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a limit on emissions is one option. The state could also boost its Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, a law that requires a certain percentage of the state's power mix come from renewables. Those ideas will be tough to get through a Republican-led Legislature.\n\nLawmakers this year are expected to debate whether to rescue the state's nuclear industry. Like coal, it's struggling to compete with gas and renewables. Nuclear reactors provide Pennsylvania's largest source of carbon-free power, but several are slated to close prematurely.\n\nKeeping those nuclear power plants operating as they are now is a very good low-pollution strategy, Apt said.\n\nIn announcing his climate goals, Wolf did not say if he would support such a plan. He did indicate he wants to go after more natural gas development while striving for lower emissions.\n\nSzybist with the NRDC said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. Gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.\n\nThe emission reductions we've seen the past few years, I think are not durable, Szybist said. They're vulnerable to going back up again unless we figure out energy policy that will really drive development of renewables.\n\nThe state has made progress on some policy fronts, joining a group of states developing a clean transportation policy, cracking down on methane leaks and releasing a plan for greater solar energy development.\n\nPolicy is most important to drive all this, but businesses and citizens can step up as well, Szybist said.\n\nDEP's draft climate action plan, which is expected to be finalized soon, accounts for what further action the state could take. It includes policies tied to nuclear, renewables, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and more options for emission reductions.\n\nYou're not going to reach the goal with just these strategies, said Robert Graff of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, who's also a member of the state's climate change advisory committee.\n\nThey only get Pennsylvania halfway to its 2050 target. But, he said, the plan is a starting point. He said he believes the governor's decision to announce those goals will get people to give the plan more consideration. The state received a federal grant to help develop it, and Graff said it's more thorough than in previous years.\n\nMaybe, technological advances in energy storage or capturing and storing carbon emissions will make an 80 percent drop easier to achieve, he said. It's also possible that at some point, the federal government could step in with sweeping policies aimed at reducing emissions, or that the public will become more willing to change carbon-intense habits by driving or flying less, for example.\n\nYou have to walk a narrow path between what's effective and what's economically feasible and also what will have less disruption to the way people like to live, Graff said.\n\nEditor's Picks
After Mass Shootings, Action On Gun Legislation Soars At State Level\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nThere's an all-too familiar fight that takes place after horrible events like those in Dallas and Orlando, centered around firearms and how — or even whether — to regulate them.\n\nGun-control advocates and Democrats call for tighter regulations. Gun-rights groups and Republicans argue that blame shouldn't be put on inanimate objects, but on the people pulling the trigger. Both sides dig in. And it seems that nothing changes.\n\nA frustrated Dallas Police Chief David Brown challenged federal lawmakers to debate gun control earlier this week, saying, Do your job. We're doing ours.\n\nState Vs. Federal\n\nWhile it's true that Congress has failed to pass new gun laws after mass shootings, despite Democrat-staged sit-ins, presidential pleas and other vocal efforts, the sense that nothing changes is wrong. At the state level, a lot changes in terms of laws.\n\nMore than 20,400 pieces of gun-related legislation have been proposed following mass shooting events in the past 25 years. Of those bills, more than 3,000 have become law, according to a working paper recently released by researchers at the Harvard Business School.\n\nIt's not that nothing changes after a mass shooting, says Deepak Malhotra, one of the paper's authors. A lot of the action on [gun control] happens across states instead of at the federal level.\n\nThe researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation — whether it tightens or loosens gun laws — depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.\n\nIf you have a Republican legislature in your state and you have a mass shooting, the net effect if you look at the actual bills that get passed is there's a significant increase in bills that loosen gun restrictions, Malhotra says.\n\nDemocrat-controlled states showed no such effect. Bills that tightened gun regulations did get proposed after mass shootings, just not at a noticeably higher rate.\n\nA good example of this is California, where the state's governor recently signed six gun-control bills into law, many of which were in response to the shooting in San Bernardino, where 14 people were killed.\n\nWe've covered a large spectrum when it comes to gun safety measures, says state Sen. Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, from high-capacity cartridges to domestic violence and temporary restraining orders.\n\nSix gun laws sounds like a lot, but for comparison, California passed 11 gun-related laws in 2013 and approved four others in 2014. It's not unusual for the deeply blue state to pass a number of laws tightening restrictions on firearms in a given year.\n\n'Instruments Of Defense'\n\nRepublican-controlled states are different. Gun-related legislation doesn't come up as often as it does in Democrat-led states, and when it does, the aim often isn't to tighten regulations, but to loosen them.\n\nTake Tennessee: Last July, a gunman killed four people and injured three more at a military recruiting station and a Navy building in Chattanooga — two places that were gun-free zones for everyone except police.\n\n[The shooting] confirmed even more the idea that gun-free zones left those servicemen and women as literally sitting ducks, says state Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden.\n\nIn response, the state has since approved five bills related to guns, including one sponsored by Holt that allows full-time employees of public universities to carry handguns on campuses, where guns were previously banned.\n\nWhen we put instruments of defense in the hands of law-abiding citizens, in my opinion, I think we see a decrease in criminal statistics, Holt says.\n\nSimilar opinions have been voiced in Florida, another Republican-controlled state, since the Orlando shooting. Nightclubs like Pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. At least one Republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in Florida.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists — similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.\n\nCertainly, it's not going to be an easy vote to win, says state Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando. But we put something forward that I believe is narrowly tailored for both parties to get behind.\n\nIt's hard to predict how the Republican-led legislatures in Florida and Texas will respond to the recent shootings. The scale of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. And the fact that the five victims of the Dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.\n\nIf history is any indicator, though, it's likely that both states will pass gun-related legislation in the coming year.
Trump Administration Proposes Major Changes To Bedrock Environmental Law\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Mone/AP Jim Mone/AP\n\nUpdated at 1:40 E.T.\n\nIn one of his most sweeping environmental proposals so far, President Trump says he wants to streamline an outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process that can delay major infrastructure projects for years.\n\nSupporters from the fossil fuel, construction, ranching and other industries welcome the move, which they've long sought. Environmental groups warn it would sideline the climate impacts of highways, pipelines and other projects, and they promise a legal challenge.\n\nThe proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which has not been updated in decades. As one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. It also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.\n\nAmerica is a nation of builders, Trump said announcing the move at the White House, whose gleaming new infrastructure used to be the envy of the world. Now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the U.S. like a Third World country. It's really sad.\n\nA key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country.\n\nUnder the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. That could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.\n\nEnvironmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.\n\nMary Neumayr, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.\n\nThis delay, she says, deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families.\n\nIndustry groups say streamlining NEPA regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. In a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.\n\nEnvironmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.\n\nThe proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to NEPA review. For example, it would exempt non-federal projects with little government funding.\n\nIn another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.\n\nThis is a clearly a conflict of interest, says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president at Center for American Progress. She was a managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration.\n\nIt's baffling that the Trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster, says Goldfuss.\n\nThe White House CEQ will collect public comments for at least 60 days before making the rule final. But there are hurdles that could keep it from taking effect.\n\nFor one thing, if Trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. Even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. And experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.\n\nThe law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,'  says Bruce Huber of Notre Dame Law School. If the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law.
A Former Immigration Judge On The Current Situation\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThe Trump administration zero tolerance policy has increased an already enormous backlog of cases for the nation's immigration courts. There are currently more than 700,000 cases pending. Paul Wickham Schmidt was an immigration judge for 13 years. He retired in 2016. Judge Schmidt joins us now. Thanks for being with us.\n\nPAUL SCHMIDT: It's my pleasure, Scott.\n\nSIMON: Is the immigration court system up to handling even more cases?\n\nSCHMIDT: No, they're not even up to handling the ones they have now.\n\nSIMON: Well, help us understand that. How long does it take, for example, for a case to work its way through the courts?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, when I retired, I was setting cases on the last day - I was on the bench June 30 of 2016. I think I was setting them for the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. I've heard they have more judges now, so maybe they've brought some of that in. But I think it's probably still 2020, 2021.\n\nSIMON: And why?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, there's too many cases and not enough judges. And the dockets have been mismanaged by the Department of Justice over the last three administrations - something I call aimless docket reshuffling.\n\nSIMON: What's that?\n\nSCHMIDT: Each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. And therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. And the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. So some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. And, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. But sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. So that disrupts dockets.\n\nSIMON: President Trump rejected a call for more immigration judges this week. He said, quote, we don't want judges. We want security on the border. How do you react?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, I don't think he understands the law and the constitution. According to the Supreme Court, everybody in the United States, regardless of status, has a right to due process under law. And you're not going to get due process from more border patrol agents. You're going to have to get judges of some type - give individuals fair hearings before an impartial decision-maker.\n\nSIMON: So the piercing cries of children that so many of us heard this week - those youngsters might not have the cases of their parents heard for - what? - two, three, four more years?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, that is if they could get out of detention. But, of course, the administration has announced that they're going to detain 100 percent of the new arrivals who cross at a place other than a port of entry. And they're going to expedite their cases. In fact, the president, as part of his executive order, ordered a new round of aimless docket reshuffling, which means those cases will go to the top of the front of the line. Other cases that are ready to be heard will go to the back of the line. And judges that are handling dockets here and in other places will, in all likelihood, be moved to the border to hear these cases leaving nobody to hear the cases on their dockets - in Arlington, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, wherever they regularly sit. So it will be a total mess in my view.\n\nSIMON: Retired Immigration Judge Paul Wickham Schmidt, thanks so much.\n\nSCHMIDT: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Biden Surrogate John Kerry: '70 Is The New 50'\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry has been making this joke at the last few events for Joe Biden: 70 is the new 50.\n\nKerry, a Biden surrogate, is alluding to the belief among some Democrats that the party should pick a nominee younger than the 77-year-old — and is batting it down.\n\nBut Biden draws a lot of his support from older voters, and at his events over the last few days, the crowds have been filled more with baby boomers than millennials.\n\nThat was largely the case Sunday when Biden kicked off his final full day of campaigning at Clarke University on the banks of the Mississippi River in Dubuque.\n\nAround the corner from the campus snack shop, Nicholas Wade, a freshman, wanted to see Biden in person, but he's supporting Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThey say in the primary, vote with your heart. And I like Elizabeth Warren's ideas the best, he said. But it's tough, because I think Joe Biden has the best chance of winning in 2020. I think sometimes he does struggle to connect with younger voters.\n\nRoss Benjamin, 30, traveled here this morning from just across the border in Wisconsin. He's planning to vote for Biden because he thinks Biden has the best shot to win over moderates and Republicans. But Benjamin says if he weren't worried about all that, he'd rather pick Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who last night packed an arena for a partylike rally featuring the band Vampire Weekend.\n\nI've seen both Warren and Bernie, and they really bring the energizing core to our generation, he said. If it wasn't about electability, it would be one of them two. I want someone who can actually get Donald Trump out of office, so I guess I'm sacrificing self-interest for the bigger picture.\n\nPeter Jarka-Sellers, 23, drove down from Minnesota last night to see Biden. He describes Biden as a good, decent guy whose life experiences really resonate with him. And he thinks Biden's policy platform is more realistic.\n\nWe're not going to get to do any of the things we want to do if [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is blocking them, and I think Biden will help us pick up some of the key Senate seats, so I'm trying to think how we can get the most done, he said. All of these people are saying stuff that's further than Congress will let them do. You're not going to get more than a public option [on health care].\n\nTucker LaBelle, a sophomore at Clarke, says he used to swing Republican and now is undecided between Sanders, 78, and Biden.\n\nA lot of people will say we need someone younger in the White House, but with the experience and history they have, it's kind of a no-brainer. They're legends, he said. I just like Bernie a little more over Biden because of the way he handles himself in public. I'm a communications major, and I focus on how people speak, and at that last debate especially, I saw a lot more personality out of Bernie.\n\nAt campaign events, Biden has heavily featured freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer as a surrogate, who in 2018 flipped a Republican district here in eastern Iowa at age 29.\n\nWhen it comes to Iowa, it is about the future of our state as well, not just our country, Finkenauer told NPR in an interview after the event. And making sure we have somebody like Joe who embodies the values I grew up with here in Iowa, where you care about your neighbors and you step up for folks, and you also get things done. And that matters — I don't care what generation you are. To see somebody who has done that his entire career, who has worked for working families, and that means everything to me, and that's what we've been talking about on the trail.
CEOs' Dilemma: Supporting Trump's Agenda, Opposing His Behavior\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUnder Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank set off a social media firestorm last February when he voiced some overly positive words about the new administration of President Trump.\n\nTo have such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset for this country. I think people should really grab that opportunity, said Plank, whose company makes sports apparel.\n\nOn Monday, Plank became the latest corporate CEO to publicly cut ties with the president, giving up his seat on a White House advisory council on manufacturing amid criticism over the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.\n\nThere is no place for racism or discrimination in this world, Plank said in a tweet.\n\nOthers quitting the council are Merck's Kenneth Frazier and Intel's Brian Krzanich. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry group, also announced his departure Tuesday, tweeting, I'm resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it's the right thing for me to do.\n\nAnd AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka also stepped down from the council.\n\nI think these leaders are waking up to the fact their continued silence in the face of mounting evidence of immorality is tantamount to consent, said Nicholas Pearce, clinical associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe departures underscore the dilemma facing corporate chief executives at a highly polarized and partisan time, said David Ulrich, professor of business at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and a partner at the consulting firm RBL Group.\n\nThey may share Trump's pro-business agenda, but find it difficult to ignore his personal behavior, Ulrich said.\n\nHow do you begin to manage the balance between the person and the policy? And I can imagine these CEOs are really struggling to find that right balance between those two things, Ulrich said.\n\nHe noted that corporations have a big stake in policy decisions being made right now, and giving up a seat at the table means having much less influence in Washington.\n\nIt's pretty easy for a CEO to say, 'These are my values. You violated them.' But the CEOs who are smart know, 'Once I back out of that opportunity to shape policy, the voice that I could have had is now lost,'  he added.\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday that he would have no trouble replacing the departed members of the advisory council and dismissed them as grandstanders.\n\nAnd some high-profile companies have said they are staying on the council.\n\nWe must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it, said Alex Gorsky, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering, and we will remain active champions for these efforts, said a spokesman for Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison.\n\nThe decision to leave is harder for some companies than others.\n\nAmong those staying on the council are the CEOs of several major companies that have substantial federal government contracts, including Lockheed Martin and United Technologies.\n\nGiven Trump's tendency to hit back hard against anyone who crosses him, such companies may be especially reluctant to anger the White House.\n\nIn this environment, it's easier for an executive to release a boilerplate statement condemning hatred than it is to open him or herself or their company up to the president's Twitter-ranting, Pearce said.
California Lawmakers Prepare For Trump, Hire Ex-Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nDemocratic leaders of the California Legislature signaled their intention Wednesday to fight any challenges to state policies by the incoming administration of Donald Trump by hiring as outside legal counsel former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe announcement came in a joint statement issued by California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\n\nWith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead, said the lawmakers.\n\nHolder will assist Gov. Jerry Brown, yet-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Javier Becerra and the Legislature to protect California's economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration. This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great.\n\nThe move comes amid escalating rhetoric from California leaders, all Democrats, since the election in which Trump lost the state by more than 4 million votes.\n\nLast month Rendon called the Trump administration a major existential threat. Days later, Brown delivered a full-throated warning that California has no intention of reversing its climate change policies.\n\nWe've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight, Brown told a group of scientists in San Francisco. We're ready to defend. California is no stranger to this fight.\n\nHolder was attorney general in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015. He's currently a partner in the law firm Covington & Burling. According to the Associated Press, the firm will be paid $25,000 a month for three months starting in February. The deal will be renegotiated afterward.\n\nBut it's not going over well with Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe state's incoming attorney general has spent decades in Washington working on federal policies, said Assemblyman Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, in a statement quoted by the Sacramento Bee. It's not clear why legislative Democrats needed to hire a D.C. insider to litigate the exact same issues.\n\nIn a statement offered by de Leon's office, Holder said he was honored to help the Legislature as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California's residents and policy priorities. I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the legislature.
Treating Opioid Addiction With A Drug Raises Hope And Controversy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nScientists and doctors say the case is clear: The best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.\n\nYet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the U.S. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.\n\nOne reason is the limited availability of the treatment. But it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. A phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. While doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.\n\nNow, the White House is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. In his 2017 budget, President Obama has asked Congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.\n\nThe White House is also highlighting success stories. At the National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit held in Atlanta in March, Obama appeared on stage with Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio. Oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. She tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. I personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, Oertle said in Atlanta. I couldn't tough it out. I know some people can. I couldn't do it. This last time has been the most successful recovery for me.\n\nHer experience isn't unique.\n\nI've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says Michael Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. We wouldn't do that with any other disease. If one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nBotticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. Researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.\n\nWe have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says Dr. Marc Fishman, medical director at Maryland Treatment Centers in Baltimore. He says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. Studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.\n\nShots - Health News We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment Listen\n\nStill, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. Their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.\n\nFor years, Juan Ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. When you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.\n\nA friend told Ramirez about a doctor in Baltimore who prescribed Suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. He liked the way Suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. He stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. Still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. I was still an addict, he says. It was just legal.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nThat line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including David Lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in Hagerstown, Md. The home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. In addition to beds, Lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. The emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. It's what worked for Lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.\n\nWhen he started his work as a recovery advocate, Lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. Soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's Suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting Suboxone. That to me just looks like heroin, Lidz says.\n\nSo he made a decision: He wouldn't accept anyone on it.\n\nToday, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. Now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on Suboxone, Lidz says.\n\nHe worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like Charles Testerman, who came to Lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. Testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. He drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. When he couldn't afford heroin, he bought Suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. It didn't work.\n\nI was doing Suboxone in the mornings, as well as Adderall to bring myself up. Then at night, I was taking Xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, Testerman says. It was just a constant cycle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nToday, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called The Stoner Farm, Anglicized from Steiner, the name of the family who built the place. Testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. I feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. It's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nFishman, the addiction doctor in Baltimore, knows there are people like Testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. But, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. He wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.\n\nThis doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. But we don't have the penicillin for addiction. These are not curative medications. In having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations I think would make us more credible.

If a Wealth Tax is Such a Good Idea, Why Did Europe Kill Theirs?\n\nEnlarge this image Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNOTE: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\n\nIn late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.\n\nIt's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.\n\nThe disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.\n\nEuro Flop\n\nNormally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.\n\nIn 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.\n\nUC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.\n\nHe argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.\n\nWarren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.\n\nAlso important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.\n\nBureaucracy and the Constitution\n\nBut having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.\n\nAnd a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.\n\nWhile the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.\n\nA Local Problem with a Global Solution\n\nIt's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.\n\nHis solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

Trump Took Fight For Border Wall To El Paso — Where O'Rourke Was Ready For Him\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump took his fight for a wall to the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday night, promising a crowd in El Paso, Texas, that he would press forward for its construction — even as news was breaking in Washington that a deal reached between congressional negotiators would fall far short of his funding demands.\n\nAnd in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, Trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by Democrat Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with Democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a White House bid that could especially challenge Trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a Southern border wall.\n\nBut the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that Trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. As another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on Capitol Hill emerged with a deal Monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's Department of Homeland Security funding bill). This will fund about 55 miles of fencing.\n\nOn stage, Trump claimed he didn't know the details and didn't want to hear about it, sticking to his robust talking points on the border wall.\n\nAs I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway, he said to raucous applause, underneath Finish The Wall banners.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Fox News conducted on the sidelines of the rally, Trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: We'll see what happens. About his push for a border wall, Trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. A wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. It's a moral thing, the president also said in the interview.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. And the selection of a rally in El Paso was no accident either — Trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the U.S. border town compared to its Mexican counterpart. However, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in El Paso.\n\nTrump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.\n\nThe president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in U.S. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. Multiple polls also showed most Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.\n\nIf Trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight Saturday — though Trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.\n\nThe whole rally largely stuck to Trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his State of the Union address.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\n\nBut Trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally O'Rourke, El Paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily Democratic city. Exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, Trump claimed that O'Rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.\n\nThat may be the end of his presidential bid, Trump said, mocking O'Rourke as a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.\n\nHe's supposed to win in order to run, the president jabbed. Beto was defeated, Trump said, referring to the race against Cruz, as the president boasted of his own undefeated record in his first bid for office.\n\nAccording to NBC News, O'Rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. And Bloomberg News reported that O'Rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. At various points during his own rally, Trump claimed that 69,000 people had RSVP'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. But NBC News reported that Trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.\n\nO'Rourke directly took on Trump over border security and Trump's desire for a wall or other physical barrier. He said El Paso was a peaceful and safe city because we treat one another with dignity and respect.\n\nWe know that walls do not save lives; walls end lives, O'Rourke also told those gathered at his rally.\n\nHe also criticized the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.\n\nWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 Democratic candidate said. We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\n\nWe will not take advantage of them, O'Rourke added about immigrants. We will not send them back to certain death. We will not believe that walls can or should keep them out. Instead, we welcome them with open arms.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\n\nTrump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. Instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.\n\nThe Democrat Party has never been more outside the mainstream. They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, Trump said. He criticized Democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.\n\nI will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country, Trump said.
Trump And China: Intentionally Provocative Or Unprepared?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, Donald Trump directed some of his strongest words toward China. He called the Chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of America's leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on China.\n\nNow, as president-elect, Trump is sounding the same notes. He caused a veritable earthquake in U.S.-China relations just by taking a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. This challenged the bedrock of U.S. relations, the One China policy, under which the U.S. officially recognizes only the government in Beijing, though it also conducts business with Taipei.\n\nAnd at his confirmation hearing last week, Trump's choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, unleashed another salvo. Though it was just one line in a nine-hour hearing, he suggested a Trump administration would be willing to wage a showdown over China's recent island building in the South China Sea.\n\nWe're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island building stops, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP\n\nSince 2013, China has built seven islands in the South China Sea. An international tribunal last year rejected China's claims to those artificial islands — and its claims to much of the South China Sea. In the meantime, China has also militarized the islands by building airstrips and installing anti-aircraft guns on them.\n\nSince Trump is not yet in office, and Tillerson hasn't yet been confirmed, it remains unclear whether Tillerson's statement was a genuine policy position or just get-tough rhetoric as Trump and his team prepare to assume power.\n\nA number of Asia analysts believe Tillerson likely misspoke or overstated the positions a Trump administration will take.\n\nWhat I think he meant was that we will not let the Chinese use these new airbases on these reclaimed islands to establish dominance in the South China Sea, says Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nGreen, a former National Security Council senior director for Asia, says the Trump administration could increase the U.S. Navy's presence in the South China Sea and the frequency of patrols — strategies the Obama administration pursued, but only to a limited degree.\n\nMy guess is that [Tillerson] was referring to options such as that — but not stating that the U.S. would blockade or interdict Chinese ships approaching those islands, says Green.\n\nGreen says the lack of clarity may be due to the lack of seasoned policy makers in the Trump transition team and the limited input from the State Department.\n\nI think the process has been less conducive to a careful and thorough consideration of exact wording than in the past, he says.\n\nThe Chinese media was less charitable in its assessment. The China Daily called Tillerson's remarks a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies.\n\nSo was David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.\n\nThis is insane and totally unenforceable, not to mention very ill-informed, ill-considered, probably not logistically feasible, and highly provocative and war-risking, he says of Tillerson's comments.\n\nTaken at face value, the remarks call for a Cuban Missile Crisis-like blockade that would prevent the Chinese from accessing the islands they claim in the South China Sea.\n\nDoing that would be no easy task for the U.S. Navy.\n\nChina's Navy has been rapidly modernizing in recent years and while it is not going to be able to defeat the U.S. necessarily, they will certainly be able to punish U.S. forces in the region in a way they couldn't before, says Avery Goldstein, director of Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe danger is that a small incident in the South China Sea could quickly escalate into a major conflict.\n\nThere is another way to look at Trump's approach so far.\n\nAlmost every recent U.S. president has said on the campaign trail that he would take a tougher stance with China. That list includes Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nThis approach is not unprecedented, says CSIS's Green. Typically, what happens in every case is that within a few months or a year or two, the policy calibrates and they go back to the norm.\n\nGoldstein, of the University of Pennsylvania, says Trump might be using tactics he learned in the business world, where you often stake out your toughest positions in the beginning.\n\nPerhaps this is just an attempt to gain bargaining leverage so that at some point, you make a deal that is better than the one you would've gotten if you'd been flexible at the beginning, he says.\n\nIt might work. Or backfire.\n\nChina has come a long way in recent years and is increasingly assertive in the international arena. President Xi Jinping is no one's idea of a pushover.\n\nThe devil, says Goldstein, is in the details. All we have so far are comments and tweets. Until they take office and formulate and implement policy, we can't be sure.\n\nNishant Dahiya is NPR's Asia editor.
Off-Duty Police Officers Investigated, Charged With Participating In Capitol Riot\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNearly 30 sworn police officers from a dozen departments attended the pro-Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol last week, and several stormed the building with rioters and are facing federal criminal charges as well as possible expulsion or other discipline.\n\nThe officers are from departments large and small. There was veteran officer in Houston, the nation's eighth-largest department; a sergeant in the small town of Rocky Mount, Va., and a group of Philadelphia transit officers.\n\nFive people were killed in the riots, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer when she attempted to breach a barricaded door inside the Capitol.\n\nHouston police officer Tam Pham, an 18-year veteran, resigned Thursday in the wake of federal charges against him, Houston Chief Art Acevedo said in a tweet. Photos emerged showing Pham inside the Capitol during the riots holding a Trump flag alongside other pro-Trump extremists. Federal prosecutors are investigating.\n\nThere is no excuse for criminal activity, especially from a police officer, Chief Acevedo said. I can't tell you the anger I feel at the thought of a police officer and other police officers thinking they get to go storm the Capitol.\n\nIn Virginia, photos emerged showing Rocky Mount Police Sgt. T.J. Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker inside the Capitol with other rioters. Robertson told The Roanoke Times that he and officer Fracker did nothing illegal. Where I was at there was no violence. There was no fighting with police officers.\n\nFederal prosecutors say otherwise.\n\nEach officer has been charged with one federal count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Both were arrested and released without bond.\n\nIn a since-deleted Facebook post, Fracker wrote after the riots: Lol to anyone who's possibly concerned about the picture of me going around... Sorry I hate freedom? ...Not like I did anything illegal...y'all do what you feel you need to. And in screenshot of a Facebook post circulating, Robertson wrote: CNN and the Left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business ... The right IN ONE DAY took the f——— U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.\n\nAsked for comment, Town Manager James Ervin said in an email to NPR that the town supports their employees' rights to engage in speech and assembly but expects the actions taken while doing so to be lawful. Ervin declined to comment further, citing the criminal probe. The officers are currently on paid leave, Ervin says, as per town policy.\n\nThe federal charges and ongoing investigations are likely to further erode public trust in police and again raise concerns about oversight and accountability, especially in the wake of 2020's nationwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice following the killings of Black men and women by police officers.\n\nChuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told NPR the charges against off-duty officers are all the more reprehensible because many officers on duty at the Capitol acted heroically that day.\n\nPolice officers should know more than others that engaging in mob behavior is abhorrent. At a time when people are questioning police legitimacy, this isn't helpful. It's worse than that, it's despicable. It's despicable because you have 50 officers hurt and one who died. This is just unconscionable, Wexler said, adding, those officers who engaged in mob behavior should be held accountable and should not be police officers. Period.\n\nSue Rahr is the former King County, Wash., sheriff who now runs the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission.\n\nOne of the top philosophical statements we make to recruits is you are guardians of the democracy. You're not just there to investigate crimes, but you're there to actually uphold the democracy, because our country depends on the rule of law, Rahr told NPR. And what happened at the Capitol was completely against everything that the concept of the rule of law stands for.\n\nIn Texas, Bexar County Sheriff's Lt. Roxanne Mathai, an eight-year veteran of the force, is on unpaid administrative leave after posting photos of herself in the pro-Trump mob on a Capitol balcony after rioters stormed past police lines. She called it on Facebook one of the best days of her life. She also faces possible federal charges. A post on her Facebook page also says and we are going in... in the crowd at the stairs...not inside the capitol like the others. Not catching a case lol.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told KSAT TV: My intent is that she never set foot in this building again.\n\nMathai's lawyer, Hector Cortes, told the news station that her role in the chaos is really just attending a political rally for a president who she supports. A department spokesman, Deputy Johnny Garcia, told NPR that Mathai already was on administrative leave from a previous incident involving an inappropriate relationship with an inmate in the jail. Garcia declined to elaborate on either case since both are under investigation.\n\nThe New York Police Department is looking into allegations one of their officers was among the rioters. John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said on Thursday, We're taking outside tips, we're getting information from the FBI, adding that internal affairs is the recipient of any allegations that anybody who is an employee of the NYPD conducted any illegal activity.\n\nSeven off-duty transit police officers in Philadelphia also face scrutiny after they attended the Trump rally preceding the attack on the Capitol, NPR member station WHYY reports.\n\nThey are being investigated to see if they were involved in riotous behavior or for violations of our social media policies, said Chief Thomas Nestel of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.\n\nIn Seattle, two police officers who attended the rally are also under investigation. Interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz in a statement said that while he fully supports all lawful expressions of free speech, if any SPD officers were directly involved in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, I will immediately terminate them. While OPA investigates, these officers have been placed on administrative leave.\n\nIn Chicago, there are calls for the resignation of John Catanzara, who heads the powerful police union. Catanzara at first strongly defended the rioters, called them nonviolent and echoed the president's false claims about election fraud in an interview with NPR station WBEZ. He later apologized.\n\nIn Oklahoma, social media posts raise questions about Canadian County Sheriff Chris West, because of statements attributed to him on a since-deleted Facebook account. West said at a press conference that he only attended the rally and did not push past police or enter the Capitol. Last Friday, West said the egregious crimes on our beacon and bastion of last hope for our nation, breaking into that and terrorizing it, I rebuke all of that, every bit of it.\n\nBut KFOR TV in Oklahoma reports that a man named Bryan Harter claims he was in the Capitol with the sheriff during the insurrection, posting on Facebook, I was in DC for the protest at the capitol with sheriff west. I took a weeks vacation spent my own money and drove 40 hours round trip! After 23 years of military service, I felt it my duty to stand for us. For fair elections. Honestly they are lucky we just occupied. We literally pushed past the police said we are here and left. Burned nothing looted nothing. Now we are called terrorists. People better wake Up, before its too late.\n\nAnd in the deleted Facebook account, KFOR reported, Sheriff West appears to embrace the baseless claims of election fraud pushed by President Trump. If they're okay rigging an election and foreign help to steal the white house and control of WeThePeople, then I'm okay with using whatever means necessary to preserve America and save FREEDOM & LIBERTY.\n\nPolice training executive Rahr says she sent a memo to all her recruits and staff reminding them of the important role law enforcement can play in reassuring the public that our democracy can survive the politically divisive conflicts that are erupting. Rahr adds the majority of law enforcement officers in this country are just as ashamed and disgusted as I am because the storming of the Capitol is, there's there's no defense for that. There just isn't.\n\nNPR's Martin Kaste contributed to this story.
Evaluating Trump's Foreign Policy From A Conservative Perspective\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump is a Republican who hasn't had a particularly conservative foreign policy. He called the Iraq War the single worst decision ever made. He's lauded Russia, praised North Korea and said he'll withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Syria. This week, he came back from Hanoi with no deal with Kim Jong Un. There's the prolonged humanitarian political crisis in Venezuela and shifting - are they staying or going - policies of U.S. troops in Syria and Afghanistan. Is this administration's foreign policy unraveling?\n\nWe're going to take stock with two foreign policy experts who are conservatives. Danielle Pletka is with the American Enterprise Institute. Thanks so much for being with us.\n\nDANIELLE PLETKA: A pleasure.\n\nSIMON: And Christopher Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute in our studios - thank you for being with us.\n\nCHRISTOPHER PREBLE: Thank you for having me.\n\nSIMON: Let's start with North Korea and you first, Danielle Pletka. Does flying halfway around the world to get nothing suggest the administration just isn't doing its homework?\n\nPLETKA: Well, yes, frankly, it does. I mean, I think that a lot of people felt, let's say, tolerably comfortable with the idea that Donald Trump wanted to start things off with a person-to-person meeting with Kim Jong Un. But by the second meeting, it appeared that it was meeting for meeting's sake and that the North Korean leader was taking the president of the United States for a ride.\n\nSIMON: Mr. Preble - Mr. Preble, sorry.\n\nPREBLE: I don't think there's ever an argument against meeting, per se. I take Danielle's point, but there's also - it's also true that we don't have regular dialogue prior to this meeting last year. And so continuing that dialogue at some level seems to me like a good idea. I would hope...\n\nSIMON: Just at some level - what about below that?\n\nPREBLE: Right. Well, that's the point. Right, that's my point. So I do think that thinking that you can start this from the top down, that perhaps may be true, but you also need to have a working-level dialogue. And I would hope that that will continue even though this particular meeting in Hanoi did not produce any breakthrough.\n\nSIMON: But did just having these two summits and President Trump's almost rhapsodic praise boosted Kim Jong Un's prestige?\n\nPREBLE: I don't endorse the praise, but I don't - I also don't believe that meeting with a leader necessarily implies an endorsement of their behavior and their - the treatment of their people. The president, after all, has met with a number of other leaders who have horrendous human rights records, including, for example, our allies, the Saudis. So that by itself does not trouble me.\n\nSIMON: Danielle Pletka, I want to get you to talk about Venezuela, if I could - President Maduro refusing to step down despite international and U.S. pressure. Do you see a discernible U.S. policy there?\n\nPLETKA: Actually, I think Venezuela is a real success story for this administration and in a very conventional way, actually. You know, here we see that the administration actually did some homework. They built the foundations. They worked with our allies. They worked with the multilateral, in this case, the Organization of American States. They really have brought together, you know, a coalition of, at this point, dozens of countries that recognize the now constitutional leader of Venezuela, Mr. Guaido. And they are ratcheting up pressure in ways that are, I think, quite careful.\n\nI recognize that this is going to be a hard slog. Maduro and his backers in Havana are very, very committed to hanging on. They have that exploited the Venezuelan people and the economy much to their personal financial advantage. And they don't want to let that go. But I do think the administration has actually shown a lot of skill in this area. I've been very impressed. And they've been quiet about it as well, which is something that we so rarely see from Donald Trump.\n\nSIMON: I want to get you to talk about that, too, Mr. Preble, but let me insert would it help for the United States to give a pledge of no military intervention to assuage people who are concerned that that's where it's headed?\n\nPREBLE: Well, I think people are concerned about it, and I think they should be concerned about that. The United States has a track record of using military force and violating the sovereignty of a number of countries, not just in this hemisphere but around the world. So I think that it is important to emphasize that there is a constitutional process that Juan Guaido is - has a legitimate claim. And I think it's equally important that the Lima Group, not just the Organization of American States but an organization - a loose coalition of states not led by the United States has endorsed Guaido is significant. But I think the United States could complicate things if it implies, as some have, that ultimately the United States is going to determine this by force.\n\nSIMON: Let me ask you both and begin with you again, Danielle Pletka - has the United States abdicated a leadership role in the world? And has that - does that really assist the world at this moment?\n\nPLETKA: That's a very tough question. You know, I mean, I firmly believe that the world is a better place when the United States leads. You know, the world is not a place where when we step back that nobody else steps in. There are plenty of eager players on the global stage, whether it's the Chinese with the rules that they like to promulgate or the Russians or even regionally whether it's the Iranians or others. You really do see that there are actual challenges to our global leadership.\n\nThe question of whether we've abdicated, though, is a - much more than a Trump question because this really began in the Obama administration. President Obama was much less committed to the American global role. And, you know, let's set aside these questions of exceptionalism that's obsessed, you know, the front pages but just less committed to an American leadership profile abroad...\n\nSIMON: Leading from behind was the phrase I remember from Libya, yeah.\n\nPLETKA: Yes, a most regrettable phrase for a most regrettable - a badly managed, badly led and badly concluded operation in Libya. So, you know, this has been a trend. And the one thing I think is absolutely clear, and I expect that Chris will disagree with me about this, but the one thing I think is clear is that without presidential leadership, the American people don't actually understand or want to sign up to anything that we do overseas except perhaps global trade. And even there now, we see a question.\n\nSIMON: Christopher Preble.\n\nPREBLE: Well, actually, Danielle and I agree on the importance of trade, and I think the president has taken a bad step in the wrong direction on that. But in terms of U.S. leadership, we have to remember where this all started. After World War II, the entire world was shattered, and the few countries that were capable of doing anything about it, one of them was the Soviet Union. And so in that context, I was pretty happy to see the United States take a leading role. But it's striking to me that Danielle mentions Russia and China and even Iran regionally but not any of the other countries in the world - of which there are roughly 190 other countries in the world - which might actually take a more leading role, at least in their own region. And, again, that's why I point back to what's happened in Venezuela and the response of other countries in the region. I just...\n\nSIMON: Are you speaking of, let's say, for example, India and Southeast Asia?\n\nPREBLE: Right, sure, of course, India or in Europe, there are still a number of important, powerful players. You look at the way that the other parties to the Iran nuclear deal are continuing to abide by that deal and try to move it forward. These are countries that have identified what their interests are, and they do not necessarily align with the United States.\n\nSIMON: Christopher Preble is vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. You have a book out next month - Peace, War, And Liberty: Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute; thank you both very much for being with us.\n\nPREBLE: Thank you.\n\nPLETKA: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Feds To Waive Penalties For Some Who Signed Up Late For Medicare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images/iStockphoto Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nEach year, thousands of Americans miss their deadline to enroll in Medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. That failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.\n\nNow Medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from those late-enrollment penalties for anyone who kept the ACA policy after becoming eligible for Medicare Part B. For those 65 and older and for people with disabilities, Medicare Part B covers doctor visits and outpatient care.\n\nMany of these people who missed the deadline did not receive the information necessary ... through the marketplace to make an informed decision regarding Medicare enrollment, says a Medicare spokesman, explaining the policy change.\n\nAutumn deadline to request a waiver of the late-enrollment penalty\n\nPeople age 65 and older who have a marketplace plan or had one they lost or canceled, as well as people who qualify for Medicare because of a disability, but chose to stay with a marketplace plan, may qualify for the penalty waiver or a reduction. They'll now have until Sept. 30 to request the waiver, according to federal health officials.\n\nThis has been a problem from the beginning of the Affordable Care Act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for Medicare, says Bonnie Burns, a consultant for the consumer group California Health Advocates. Once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for Medicare, nobody told them to make that change.\n\nLisa Grimes' 49-year-old sister is one of those people. She receives Social Security disability benefits because of mental illness. She became eligible for Medicare automatically because of the disability benefits, but she had marketplace coverage at that time. (Grimes agreed to be interviewed as long as her sister was not identified.)\n\nGrimes' sister mistakenly opted to keep her marketplace plan and drop her Part B coverage, probably because her marketplace premium at the time cost half as much, says Grimes. That decision has kept Grimes, a St. Louis real estate lawyer, busy for months, unraveling the consequences.\n\nOnly after the sister's $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did she and Grimes learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join Medicare.\n\nThe rules are tricky, and mistakes are common\n\n\n\nOther Medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn't need Part B if they had a marketplace plan, or retiree coverage from a former employer, or health coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or via a current employer with fewer than 20 workers. Beneficiaries didn't realize that none of these is a substitute for Medicare Part B.\n\nGrimes says her sister couldn't afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. After that, the Social Security Administration denied her appeal to reinstate her Part B coverage with no penalty or wait period. Then she learned about the new Medicare waiver — from a Missouri counselor at the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\n\nIt took several hours for Grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. But with assistance from the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received Part B coverage without a late fee or waiting period. It was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.\n\nUsually people need to sign up for Part B within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to Medicare rules. Most people under 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits qualify for Part B after 24 months of benefits.\n\nUnder the ACA, people who qualify for Medicare will lose subsidies if they choose to remain in plans purchased on the federal or state exchanges. And being enrolled in one of those plans does not protect them from a permanent late enrollment penalty from Medicare.\n\nMarketplace insurers, who are often the first to spot when a member is turning 65, are barred under the health law from canceling coverage because that member may qualify for Medicare, Burns says.\n\nLast summer, Medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. The notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in Marketplace and Medicare coverage. Officials also began contacting individuals who already have both Medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.\n\nHow to get a waiver of the penalty\n\nYet many people have missed the warnings.\n\nThese are very complex rules, says Stacy Sanders, federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, which spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors' advocacy organizations to convince Medicare officials to address the problem.\n\nThe lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying Part B, Sanders says.\n\nIn March, Medicare began emailing letters about the temporary waiver to some people 65 and older who are enrolled in plans sold on the marketplaces run by the federal government. But others who may be eligible for a waiver are not getting those notices.\n\nCalifornia, which has the largest state-run marketplace, serving 1.4 million consumers, is planning a similar information campaign. So are some other states that run their own marketplaces, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.\n\nPeople who may be eligible for the waiver, officially called time-limited equitable relief, must submit a request by Sept. 30. You can find information on how to apply on the Medicare Rights Center's Medicare Interactive website or can call the center's helpline at 800-333-4114.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Remembering Adrian Cronauer, The DJ Who Inspired 'Good Morning Vietnam'\n\nCronauer, who died last week, hosted an armed forces radio show in Saigon during the Vietnam War and later was the subject of a film starring comic Robin Williams. Originally broadcast in 1988.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM)\n\nROBIN WILLIAMS: (As Adrian Cronauer) Good morning, Vietnam. Hey, this is not a test. This is rock 'n' roll. Time to rock it from the delta to the DMZ. Is that me, or does that sound like an Elvis Presley movie? Viva Da Nang. (Singing) Oh, Viva Da Nang.\n\nGROSS: That's Robin Williams in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam playing a fictionalized version of Adrian Cronauer. Cronauer died last Wednesday at the age of 79. In 1965, during the war in Vietnam, he was a DJ in Saigon on Armed Forces Radio hosting a Top 40 radio show called Dawn Buster in which he signed on each morning with the now-famous words, good morning, Vietnam. After returning to the States, he continued working in broadcasting. But with the money he earned from the movie, he went to law school.\n\nI spoke with him in early 1988 when he was a second-year law student at the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to become active in veterans' causes and served as an adviser to the State Department's Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Office. I asked him what the Armed Forces Radio station in Saigon sounded like when he got there.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nADRIAN CRONAUER: If you've seen the film, you'll notice at the very beginning there was a very dull, dry, boring, soporific announcement about how to get your hold baggage if you'd lost your duffel bag or your trunk out of Tan Son Nhut Air Base. That is as accurate depiction as is humanly possible of what the station sounded like when I got there. And one of my aims was just to make it sound more like a stateside station.\n\nGROSS: How did you sign on the first morning that you did your show?\n\nCRONAUER: The same as I did every other one. We would have a little bit of music from an album called Like Tweet by Joe Puma and the Audiobon All-Stars.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCRONAUER: And then I would say, good morning, Vietnam, and then start into the program that way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: Did you get an immediate reaction from the soldiers who were listening to your show?\n\nCRONAUER: No. The reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. We did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. First of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. But secondly, there was a reaction that I would get mostly when I went out into the field. We would get an occasional card and letter. But if I'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? And I'd say Cronauer. And they'd say, oh, yeah, I think I - and I'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. And I found out later on that many times the GIs, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if I'd do the good morning, Vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the GI equivalent of get stuffed, Cronauer.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) What did you play the most when you were on the air?\n\nCRONAUER: Whatever happened to be currently popular, again, looking at what were the popular songs in the States and assuming that the GIs who came over from the States would want to hear what's popular back at home. Our whole idea was whether it was in the music policy or the production that we did on the air, it was to make it sound as much as possible like a stateside radio station to give them a little link with home as a morale factor.\n\nGROSS: In the movie, the Robin Williams version of Adrian Cronauer is censored when he wants to read the real news that comes across the wire. All the news that comes over the wire is first presented to censors. And in the movie, the character witnesses a bombing at a restaurant that a lot of the Army men hang out in, and he's not allowed to mention that on the air. Similar things happened to you?\n\nCRONAUER: On the subject of censorship, the movie is very accurate, except in one small detail. We did not have censors on premises at the stations. It was done by phone. But there was indeed a restaurant called the My Canh floating restaurant. It was built on a boat that was moored in the Saigon River.\n\nAnd one evening, I had dinner there with some friends from the station. And after dinner, we were still hanging out in the area when the Viet Cong sprayed the boat with shrapnel from a Claymore mine. And then, about three or four minutes later, when everyone was panicking and trying to get off the boat, they aimed another Claymore mine directly at the gangplank and did a lot of carnage. And I heard the report of the explosion and the commotion and went back to see what was going on, tried to help out a bit and then went back to the station to see if I could put the item on the air.\n\nAnd I called the duty officer for permission to put the story on the air and was denied permission. And I asked for a reason. And he said, we have no official confirmation of this happening yet. And I explained that I had been there in person, had seen it with my own eyes. And the answer was still, no, we have no real confirmation of any casualties. And I said, sir, with my own eyes, I've seen heads severed from torsos. Barring the second coming, they will not get up and walk away. And the final answer was no. And the final reason was, well, suppose we're wrong.\n\nGROSS: So you didn't defy the order and then go on the air, right (laughter)?\n\nCRONAUER: No, I did not go and lock myself in the studio and put it on anyway. No. In fact, there are a lot of things in that movie that Robin does - if I had actually done them, I would have been court martialed, and I'd still be in Leavenworth.\n\nGROSS: When you were on the air, were there any signs in the control room that there was actually a war going on?\n\nCRONAUER: It was basically a traditional, ordinary, run-of-the-mill radio station control room. The only real reminder of the war was the fact that on the console beside the turntables was a loaded .45. Over in the newsroom, there was another one beside the teletype machines. And we were instructed that if it was necessary, we were expected to use it.\n\nGROSS: You were in Vietnam in 1965. And that was a year that the war really escalated. What were some of the things that you saw that made you realize that the war was really changing?\n\nCRONAUER: When I got to Saigon in May of '65, it was a sleepy, little French colonial town. And in one year's time, I saw it turn into a nightmare. The massive influx of American personnel, equipment, armament, money turned the city upside down. There were the - when I left, the black market was flourishing. The economy was in disarray. The traffic was unmanageable. The entire city was ridiculous. And although I found it a very enjoyable place to be when I first got there, in the context of a - that it was a war going on, it was - I was very glad to get out.\n\nGROSS: What was your reaction the first time you saw the completed movie?\n\nCRONAUER: For about five minutes or so, it was difficult to get used to the idea that, well, that's Adrian Cronauer up there, but I'm Adrian Cronauer. But he's me, but I'm here. And then finally, I just settled down and said, all right, relax. Enjoy the movie.\n\nGROSS: Well, Adrian Cronauer, I want to thank you very much for talking with me.\n\nCRONAUER: My pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Adrian Cronauer, recorded in 1988 after the release of the film Good Morning, Vietnam, in which Robin Williams played a fictionalized version of Cronauer.

After Holland approves a case, it then goes to the desk of Maj. Gen. Kelly McKeague, JPAC's military commander. He has never denied a request, but he says the extreme scrutiny is more than justified. The work JPAC does, McKeague says, matters more than work the FBI might do in a death penalty case.\n\nThere's much more at stake, he says. It defines us as a nation.\n\nMcKeague then cites a quote attributed to Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States: The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself forgotten.\n\nThird, the process is mired in bureaucracy. The disinterments JPAC does approve must go through additional government layers to the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the Army for final approval. While these steps tend to be a rubber stamp — the Army has never turned JPAC down — DNA can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.\n\nHolland acknowledges that the best way to honor those individuals would be to identify them, and that the quickest way to do that would be to exhume them and use DNA. Still, he's conservative; he says he's handcuffed by Pentagon policy and hesitant to lose any more autonomy by pushing for more disinterments.\n\nAnd there's an additional complication: Disinterred remains that JPAC can't identify end up sitting in boxes on shelves in a closet. Most people agree that's not the way to honor soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice, and JPAC told NPR and ProPublica that the standard for disinterring U.S. service members is very high. They don't want to dig up remains unless they are pretty confident they can identify them.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the 45,000 MIAs and POWs the Pentagon believes are recoverable are interred as unknowns in American military cemeteries around the world.\n\nOne of them is Bud Kelder. He is buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, and his family still wants him to come home.\n\nBud lived through hell, says his cousin, Ron Kelder. Of his 26 years of life, the last seven months was sheer hell. That's not where Bud would want to be. Our government has a policy of returning everybody, leave nobody behind. I think they should honor it.
Flint Pediatrician Says Charges Against Ex-Governor Help 'Wounds Finally Close'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nThe Flint, Mich., water crisis resulted in charges Wednesday against former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who is now facing two counts of willful neglect of duty.\n\nThe misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. They come almost seven years after the city of Flint began taking in water from the Flint River in an attempt to save money. The water wasn't properly treated, and it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. More than 100,000 Flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead.\n\nDuring an arraignment Thursday, Snyder pleaded not guilty to the charges. Several additional officials are also facing charges over their alleged roles in the crisis, including the state's former health director and Flint's former director of public works.\n\nThe charges drew mixed reactions from people who have been working to help the city deal with the crisis and its aftermath.\n\nAccountability is great, but even with accountability, even if Rick Snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with residents, said LaTricea Adams, who heads Black Millennials For Flint, which advocates for the rights of Flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.\n\nMona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who was among the first to raise a red flag over the contamination, said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition that having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nYears ago, Hanna-Attisha began noticing that her young patients in Flint were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood following the change in the water supply. She called a press conference in September 2015 and warned residents, especially children, to stop drinking the water.\n\nMore than five years later, Hanna-Attisha is now the director of Flint's pediatric public health initiative. She is also the author of What the Eyes Don't See, a book about her experiences in the crisis.\n\nBelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nCan I ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong. What was going through your mind?\n\nIt was the summer of 2015. I was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. And she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that Mona, the water isn't being treated properly in Flint. And because of that, there's probably lead in the water. And that's the moment that my life changed. When I heard the word lead, it was a call to action. I respect the science of what lead does. I understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. And I also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. It's the last thing our kids in Flint needed. That's the moment I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating, I lost about 30 pounds. And I began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.\n\nWhat do you make of these charges now?\n\nIt's a bit of disbelief. It's been so long. And for so many people in Flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied — that there was never going to be this level of accountability. And as a physician in Flint, I never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. There [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. And as I began to practice more in Flint and interact with the families in Flint, I began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. Because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. And it's been open for about seven years. And having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nYou've written a book, and in it you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. Can you explain how you see that?\n\nSo many people ask me, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? And there's not one villain. There's not 10 villains. There [are] many villains. And this is what I say in my book:\n\nThere are lots of villains in this story. A disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. Many people stopped caring about Flint and Flint's kids. Many people looked the other way. People in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. While charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. Because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. The real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.\n\nAnd these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison Flint with policy. And I hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.\n\nWhat could that possibly look like now? Even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?\n\nThat has been my work since Day 1. From the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. You can think of what happened in Flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. And we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. So what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support Flint families — like child care, like Medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. Because what Flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. And people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.\n\nWould the crisis have happened had Flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?\n\nOf course not. Flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. It never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. There's a long history of racism in Flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.\n\nAs the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is.\n\nMy focus is to make sure that the kids of Flint have the brightest future possible, that we can not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.\n\nCatherine Whelan produced the audio version of this story.

Remembering A Congressman Who Bucked His Party On An Impeachment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nWhen I met Tom Railsback a few years ago, he told me he'd worried about going to a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Peoria in the fall of 1974.\n\nTom Railsback of Illinois was a middle-aged Republican congressman from a state in the middle of America when he was on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 that heard the case for impeachment against President Richard Nixon.\n\nMr. Railsback greatly admired President Nixon. His opening of the door to China, he told me, had to be the most brilliant foreign policy move ever.\n\nBut, when President Nixon refused to turn over records and recordings requested by Congress, Tom Railsback took to the floor to say, If the Congress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to exonerate, we'll be regarded as a paper tiger.\n\nTom Railsback worked with Democrats to draft an article of impeachment that charged President Nixon with abuse of his authority to obstruct the Watergate investigation. It was this article that won support from six Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. And when Richard Nixon realized he could not take Republican support for granted, he resigned in August of 1974.\n\nTom Railsback, as of this moment, is a dead duck, declared the Journal Star of Peoria, a city near his district.\n\nHow will this play in Peoria? was an old vaudeville phrase that people in the Nixon administration also used to ask if a policy would be popular in what they took to be the heart of America.\n\nSo, when the congressman was invited for lunch at the Peoria Chamber of Commerce just a few weeks later, he knew friends and neighbors who had supported him would be there, and be upset.\n\nBut I figured, he told me, you have to look the people you represent in the eye. Give them a chance to tell you you're wrong.\n\nTom Railsback remembered that when he walked into the Peoria dining room, it fell silent. Then he heard one person start to applaud; then a few more; and soon people all over the room stood up to applaud.\n\nPeople came up to shake my hand, he said, and tell me, 'Tom, I disagree with that vote. But you did what you thought was right, and I'm glad you represent me.' \n\nTom Railsback died this week at the age of 87. He was reelected to Congress after his impeachment vote, time after time after time.
In Japan, Pence Talks Trade And North Korea's Threat To The Region\n\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda is focused. The other major issue is trade. Pence met with Japan's prime minister.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where so much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda has been focused, especially with these tensions with North Korea. In Tokyo this morning, the vice president repeated what he had said the day before in South Korea.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The United States will continue to work with Japan and with all our allies in the region, including South Korea, to confront the most ominous threat posing this region of the world - the regime in North Korea.\n\nGREENE: Of course, North Korea is not the only subject on the vice president's mind. And NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following the trip and joins us from Tokyo. Anthony, good morning.\n\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\n\nGREENE: So trade is the other big issue here on this visit. The Trump administration, as we know, has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that was so prominent on the campaign trail. And they keep talking about, quote, bilateral agreements. What is the point of stressing that word?\n\nKUHN: The idea, David, is that the U.S. wants to renegotiate trade deals not with the whole region of Asia but with individual trading partners and that includes Japan. And Pence emphasized that they want a more level playing field, better terms of trade that gives American companies better access to the Japanese market, allows them to sell more products and create more jobs in the U.S.\n\nGREENE: So is Japan open to this? Is there a way that they can get something out of a new deal with the United States?\n\nKUHN: Well, you know, Japan feels that they worked so hard for so many years on the TPP. And they got a - what they thought was a pretty good deal. So basically they would like not to kill it off. They would like to keep the TPP alive with the other 11 countries, keep it in some form and then do a separate, perhaps, bilateral deal with the U.S. later.\n\nBut they are wary of any new deal that would challenge their protection of certain sectors, most importantly agriculture. Rice, as you can imagine, is a very politically symbolic industry in Japan.\n\nGREENE: So interesting too because Shinzo Abe, the Japanese leader, the first leader to meet with Donald Trump, gave him a golden golf club, I mean, has really been trying to develop this relationship and probably hoping that he has some sort of leverage.\n\nKUHN: That's right. But, you know, the relationship has changed a lot since President Trump or Trump back in the 1980s started railing against the imbalances in trade. You know, the Japanese economy has stagnated for more than two decades. And it's been eclipsed by China as the second largest economy.\n\nAnd Japan is just not seen as the economic threat and competitor that it was. And at the same time, you know, the importance of Japanese-invested factories that create jobs in places like Indiana, where Mike Pence was governor before, have become very important.\n\nNow, there are also new things. Japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when President Trump would like to build more infrastructure in the U.S. And also remember that in 2011 following the Fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, Japan shut down its nuclear plants. So now Japan is a very good market for U.S. exports of oil and natural gas.\n\nGREENE: So it almost sounds like Donald Trump had this line from the 1980s and maybe he's using the same line for a country that really has changed a lot?\n\nKUHN: Yes, that's true in China as well. He blamed both countries for devaluing their currency when it hasn't been the case for quite awhile. Trump is still very concerned about keeping the yen on, you know, the yen weak to the dollar - I mean, excuse me, strong to the dollar so that Japanese exports don't flood the U.S. market.\n\nGREENE: OK. NPR's Anthony Kuhn covering the vice president's trip to Japan, speaking to us from Tokyo. Anthony, thanks a lot.\n\nKUHN: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Appears To Back Off 2-State Solution In Meeting With Netanyahu\n\nMeeting Israel's prime minister, President Trump said he does not think a Palestinian state next to Israel is necessarily the way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, representing a shift in U.S. policy.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nNow let's look at what Donald Trump had to say about Israel as he stood alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.\n\nMICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: For decades, the U.S. approach to the Middle East peace process was based on the idea of two states for two peoples, the Palestinians and the Israelis. But Donald Trump is shaking this up.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.\n\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Laughter).\n\nTRUMP: I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one.\n\nKELEMEN: That's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chuckling in the background. When an Israeli journalist pressed him on this, Netanyahu said he didn't want to get bogged down in labels. The Israeli prime minister says he's looking for new ways to reach peace with the Palestinians.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nNETANYAHU: And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach, from involving our newfound Arab partners.\n\nKELEMEN: It's been dubbed the outside-in approach, and the idea is that Arab states will encourage the Palestinians to make peace with Israel, and Israel will get broad recognition in the Muslim world. David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy says Arab states may be working more closely now with Israel on security issues but don't want to stick out their neck for Netanyahu.\n\nDAVID MAKOVSKY: Right now, the Arab states have an under-the-table relationship with the Israelis, and whatever they get from Israel under the table they get for free, so to speak. So I don't know if they have an incentive to go above the table, and I don't know if that's going to bring the Palestinians in or not.\n\nKELEMEN: Makovsky doesn't believe the Trump administration is really backing away from the idea of a two-state solution. He says Trump's remarks were mainly for political tactical reasons to help out Netanyahu, whose critics at home made this a key issue.\n\nMAKOVSKY: In many ways, the question of whether we're going to hit a two-state solution is like saying, how are we going to get the runner home from third base when we don't even have a runner on first base yet?\n\nKELEMEN: Palestinians, though, are calling on Trump and Netanyahu to be clear about the alternatives - either a non-democratic Israel that treats Palestinians as second-class citizens or a country that no longer has a Jewish majority. We reached Hanan Ashrawi of the PLO's executive committee in Ramallah.\n\nHANAN ASHRAWI: If they want one state, let's deal with citizenship and equal rights. And we'll all become citizens of that one state, and we will act democratically.\n\nKELEMEN: Ashrawi says President Trump is going against the global consensus on the Middle East and listening so far mainly to right-wing leaders in Israel and to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose family has supported Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank.\n\nASHRAWI: They know that they cannot make any moves, or they cannot launch any kind of peace initiative if they want one without addressing the Palestinian question and talking to the Palestinian political leadership. And I think they will sooner or later. Right now, I think they're feeling their way. They're not sure. I'd much rather they study the file, they study the case before they jump to conclusions.\n\nKELEMEN: There are some signs that Trump may already be moderating his positions. He says he's still studying whether to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. Arab leaders have been privately urging him not to do that, and they've raised concerns about the Israeli government's plans to expand settlements in the West Bank. Trump had a message for Netanyahu on that today, too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made.\n\nKELEMEN: Netanyahu seemed to be taken aback and was making no promises to rein in building projects. He argued that this is not the core of the problem. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

China Cuts Tariffs On Autos, Possibly Easing Trade Tensions With U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption -/AFP/Getty Images -/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:18 p.m. ET\n\nChina is cutting tariffs on vehicles from the U.S., but the biggest benefits could go to German automakers — and Tesla, the American electric-car maker.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping signaled in a speech last month that the tariff cut would be coming. The foreign ministry confirmed it Tuesday: Tariffs will drop from 25 percent to 15 percent for imported cars. Tariffs on imported auto parts will fall to six percent.\n\nU.S. manufacturers and policymakers have been arguing for years that China should lower its tariffs. President Trump railed against the imbalance in trade tariffs in April, tweeting that they amount to STUPID TRADE. The U.S. imposes a tariff of just 2.5 percent on vehicles imported from China.\n\nThe tariff reduction is seen as an olive branch to the Trump administration. It comes as the two countries work to avoid a trade war after the tough-talk and tariff escalations last month.\n\nChina is a huge market for the U.S. auto industry. America shipped almost $10 billion worth of vehicles to China in 2017, according to the Commerce Department, plus another $3.5 billion in vehicle parts.\n\nBut much of that trade originates from companies whose headquarters are outside the U.S. BMW and Mercedes-Benz, for example, build cars in the U.S. to be shipped to China. BMW sold nearly 107,000 U.S.-made vehicles to China last year, while Mercedes-Benz sold more than 72,000, according to LMC Automotive.\n\nBusiness U.S. Puts Trade War On Hold While Talking With China, Mnuchin Says U.S. Puts Trade War On Hold While Talking With China, Mnuchin Says Listen · 4:34 4:34\n\nThe two biggest U.S. car companies, General Motors and Ford, don't rely as much on exporting to China. Instead, they build the majority of cars they sell in China in that country. The Chinese market is important for both of them — GM sells more cars in China than it does in the U.S. But because most of those cars are built and sold in China, the sales are not subject to the tariffs.\n\nThere is at least one U.S.-based car manufacturer that could win big from the reduction in Chinese tariffs. Tesla has been looking to break into the Chinese market, but the 25 percent tariff has put its already-expensive electric vehicles out of reach for most Chinese consumers. Tesla sold nearly 15,000 cars in China last year, according to LMC.\n\nChina says the new tariff policy will take effect in July.
Libertarian Candidates Pitch Themselves As Antidote To Partisanship\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\n\nLibertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees.\n\nBoth are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues.\n\nWe want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think that, said Weld, the party's vice presidential nominee.\n\nJohnson, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 before becoming the Libertarian nominee four years ago, said if they are elected, the two longtime lawmakers will almost act as co-presidents — sharing a staff and planning to do this as a partnership.\n\nTwo heads for the price of one, and that it would be a plus for the country, believing that, the former New Mexico governor said.\n\nI think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House, and we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party, the smartest people from the Republican Party and the best people from the Libertarian Party, Weld added.\n\nThe two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.\n\nA third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void.\n\nThe idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington, Weld said. That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.\n\nJohnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was beholden to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that smacks of pay-to-play.\n\nBut Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq.\n\nHe's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man, Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.\n\nJohnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though.\n\nA wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil, he told a questioner.\n\nJohnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that religious freedom, as a category was a black hole, and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding.\n\nI fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against, Johnson said. There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.\n\nShetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.\n\nMy head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up, Johnson said. This discrimination does exist.\n\nOn the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.\n\nWe both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists, Johnson said. We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists. We don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe.
New York, Illinois Governors Issue Stay At Home Orders, Following California's Lead\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 5:48 p.m. ET\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday afternoon issued an order for all Illinois residents to stay at home, as the deadly coronavirus has spread to a quarter of the state's counties and infected more than 500 people.\n\nThe stricter limits go into effect on Saturday.\n\nThey follow a similar order by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who issued a mandate earlier on Friday, and another by California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday. The governors of Connecticut, Nevada and New Jersey also say they want people to stay at home.\n\nWe know this will be hard, Pritzker said in a news conference, adding that the new rules are expected to last until April 7.\n\nThat gives us time to see whether or not this social distancing ... is having the desired effect of slowing the spread of COVID-19, he said.\n\nPritzker said essential services including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open, and restaurants will be allowed to continue take-out services. But most other places will have to shut down.\n\nHowever, he pleaded with people not to rush out to a grocery store or gas station to stockpile essential goods.\n\nHealth care professionals and other essential workers will be provided with safe child care, according to Pritzker, who offered no details on how such programs will work. Students will also continue receiving free meals, he said.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took what what he calls the ultimate step in his state to protect the public, signing an executive order mandating that 100% of workforce must stay home, excluding essential services.\n\nThe order, which Cuomo announced Friday, excludes businesses such as pharmacies and grocery stores, along with essential services such as utilities and Internet providers.\n\nWhen I talk about the most drastic action we can take — this is the most drastic action we can take, Cuomo said.\n\nIn addition to the workforce order, all nonessential gatherings of individuals in New York state are now canceled — of ANY size for ANY reason, Cuomo said via Twitter. The ban applies to any party, celebration or social event.\n\nYouTube\n\nNew York has confirmed more than 7,100 cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, making it by far the largest single source of the nearly 15,500 cases now reported in the U.S. As of Friday, 38 people in the state had died from the respiratory disease. Nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for killing at least 205 people.\n\nNew York has tested more than 32,000 people for the virus, including 10,000 in one day, Cuomo said. And he said the high number of new cases — New York added some 2,900 coronavirus cases from Thursday to Friday — should not in itself worry people.\n\nIt was the reality, he said. The tests are just demonstrating what was.\n\nBut in a separate part of his news conference, the governor also said his state must add more hospital beds and ventilators to accommodate the influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe rate of increase in the number of cases portends a total overwhelming of our hospital system, Cuomo said.\n\nNew York is working to boost its number of hospital beds, which currently stands at around 50,000. The governor's office says around 18% of the state's coronavirus cases, or 1,255 people, are currently hospitalized.\n\nI believe these policies will save lives. And I'm not willing to put a price on a human life, Cuomo said at a news conference late Friday morning.\n\nStaying at home doesn't mean not being permitted to exercise outdoors.\n\nIt's running. It's hiking, Cuomo said of the preferred activities. It's not playing basketball with five other people. That's not what it is. It's not laying in a park with 10 other people and sharing a beer. That's not what this is.\n\nThe New York order is similar to escalating steps taken in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home indefinitely to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nAs of noon ET Friday, Washington state had reported 1,376 coronavirus cases, and California had reported 1,030, according to a COVID-19 dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, which reports coronavirus numbers in near real time.\n\nCoronavirus: Know The Basics (And Wash Your Hands)\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people also experience fatigue, headaches and, less frequently, diarrhea. Cases can range from mild to moderate to severe. About 80 percent of cases so far seem to be mild, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nTo prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer if a sink isn't available. The WHO says people should wear face masks only if they're sick or caring for someone who is.\n\nWhat should I do if I think I'm sick?\n\nIf you think you've been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Many state and local health departments have set up hotlines to answer questions, so that's another good place to start. It's important that you don't expose others. Call your doctor before you go to their clinic so they can take necessary precautions.\n\nHow do I protect my home?\n\nWash your hands as soon as you walk through the door. Avoid sharing personal items such dishes, cups, utensils. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces like door handles and cellphones every day.\n\nHow do I self-quarantine? And what does it mean?\n\nThe CDC has a guide for caring for yourself at home if you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
Trump Officials Approve Tennessee's Controversial Request To Revamp Medicaid Funding\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nWith less than a dozen days left in power, the Trump administration on Friday approved a radically different Medicaid financing system in Tennessee. With this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from Washington, allowing Tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend Medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.\n\nInstead of the open-ended federal contribution to the funding of Medicaid in all other states — which increases with higher enrollment and associated health costs — Tennessee will instead get a capped amount of money, via an annual block grant.\n\nThe annual funding cap will increase if enrollment grows. What's different is that, unlike with other states, Medicaid funding to Tennessee won't automatically keep up with rising expenses.\n\nThe approval is a 10-year experiment, according to Friday's announcement by Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. They think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.\n\nBut Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center sees the move as a step backward for the state's Medicaid program.\n\nNo other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, Johnson says. It gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.\n\nTennessee is one of 12 states that have not approved expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act – a decision that's left tens of thousands of working adults in Tennessee without health insurance.\n\nWhether this change in the way Tennessee's Medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. The incoming Biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.\n\nImplementing such a fundamental change via an executive branch action rather than getting Congress to amend Medicaid law is also likely to be met with court challenges.\n\nIn any event, the changes to the state's program will take months to implement because the shift in policy requires final approval by the legislature, and officials in Tennessee must also negotiate quality of care targets with the administration.\n\nTennCare, the state's Medicaid program, says the new system would give it unprecedented flexibility to decide who is covered and what services it will pay for.\n\nUnder the agreement, TennCare will have a specified annual spending cap, to be based on historical spending, inflation and predicted future enrollment changes. If the state can operate the program at a lower cost than the cap and maintain or improve quality, the state then shares in the savings.\n\nTrump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. If Medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. If enrollment drops, it will get less money.\n\nThis groundbreaking waiver puts guardrails in place to ensure appropriate oversight and protections for beneficiaries, while also creating incentives for states to manage costs — while holding them accountable for improving access, quality and health outcomes, Verma said. It's no exaggeration to say that this carefully crafted demonstration could be a national model moving forward.\n\nThe agreement is somewhat different from traditional block grants championed by conservatives, the CMS notes, since it allows Tennessee to get more federal funding as enrollment grows. And while the state is given flexibility to increase benefits, it can't on its own cut benefits.\n\nHowever, opponents — including most advocates for low-income Americans — say the approach will threaten care for the 1.4 million people in TennCare — a group that includes children, pregnant women and the disabled. Federal funding covers two-thirds of the cost of the program.\n\nDemocrats have fought back against block grant Medicaid proposals since the Reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of Republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act. Even some key Republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.\n\nThe approval of Tennessee's request comes as Medicaid enrollment is at its highest-ever level.\n\nMore than 76 million Americans are covered by the state-federal health program — a million more than when the Trump administration took charge in 2017. Enrollment has jumped by more than 5 million in the past year as the economy slumped with the pandemic.\n\nMedicaid, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. As a result, the more money states spend on Medicaid, the more they get from Washington.\n\nThe newly approved demonstration project in Tennessee calls for CMS to work with the state to set spending targets that will increase at a fixed amount each year.\n\nThe plan also includes a safety valve to increase federal funding in the case of unexpected increases in enrollment.\n\nThe safety valve will maintain Tennessee's commitment to enroll all eligible Tennesseans with no reduction in today's benefits for beneficiaries, according to a CMS written statement.\n\nTennessee has committed to maintaining coverage for eligible beneficiaries and existing services while staying under the spending targets.\n\nIn exchange for taking on this financing approach, the state will receive a range of operating flexibilities from the federal government, as well as up to 55% of the savings generated on an annual basis when spending falls below the aggregate spending cap and the state meets certain quality targets, yet to be determined.\n\nThe state can spend that money on various health programs for residents, plus areas that Medicaid funding typically doesn't cover, such as improving transportation and education and employment for enrollees.\n\nTen years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the Trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.\n\nThe block grant is just another example of putting politics ahead of health care during this pandemic, says Johnson of the Tennessee Justice Center. Now is absolutely not the time to waste our energy and resources limiting who can access health care.\n\nState officials in Tennessee applauded the approval.\n\nIt's a legacy accomplishment, says Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. This new flexibility means we can work toward improving maternal health coverage and clearing the waiting list for developmentally disabled.\n\nThis means we will be able to make additional investments in TennCare without reduction in services and provider cuts.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

Why This Progressive Says She's Backing Biden In New Hampshire\n\nState Senator Marsha Fuller Clark tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro that she's focused on a candidate who can win over the general electorate and beat President Trump in November.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nDemocrats have just begun to cast their votes for who they think can take on President Trump in November. Coming up is New Hampshire, then on across the country. But where there was once a feeling of celebration at the wealth of nominees, there is now anxiety among some. No clear front-runner has emerged, even as the nominees have been winnowed down.\n\nJoining me now is Martha Fuller Clark. She's a state senator from Portsmouth, N.H. And she's just announced a surprising endorsement which may illuminate some of the tough calculations Democrats are making.\n\nWelcome to the program.\n\nMARTHA FULLER CLARK: Why, thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: In 2016, you endorsed Bernie Sanders. He represents the progressive wing of the party. But now you are backing Joe Biden, who certainly does not. Why?\n\nFULLER CLARK: It's a very different election in 2020. And I think the one significant question that we as Democrats have to ask over and over again - which Democrat is best placed to beat Donald Trump? That's why I am supporting Biden.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Why did you turn away from Sanders this time?\n\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think that Bernie deserves a lot of credit for having changed the conversation in terms of policy within the Democratic Party. That was very strong in 2016. But what he's promising - is it really realistic to be able to achieve those goals under his administration and his leadership? I don't think that that's viable in this country at this time from what I see and what I understand.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. If you're going to pick a moderate, though, why not an Amy Klobuchar or a Pete Buttigieg?\n\nFULLER CLARK: I think they don't have the same level of experience as Joe Biden, and they certainly don't have the credentials with regard to foreign affairs and international policies, which are so key and at great risk with our current president. So I also think that Joe Biden is very well-liked. He's very compassionate. He has great integrity. He's trusted by voters from all different political directions. That's really important if we're going to be able to win in November.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I think what I'm hearing you say is that for you - and I will say for probably many other Democrats - your personal policy preferences are sort of being left to the side. And what is more important is what the general electorate might go for - this idea of electability - not what you might want, but maybe what the country might go for.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Right. And I think the country is looking for a president who is going to be able to bring us all together, regardless of our backgrounds.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But polls show that for Democrats in New Hampshire, the most important thing is not policies. It is, as you say, beating Trump. But people have very different opinions on what's needed. And do you think that's why Democrats are so fractured right now? - because each candidate has some weaknesses when you look at that equation.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Right. There is no perfect candidate. What we're seeing over and over again is there still is a high number of undecided voters. It may be one reason why the turnout was less than had been predicted in Iowa. I think on another level that voters are exhausted by the trauma of Washington.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: When you're in the room with other Democrats, I imagine the debates must be pretty heated. People have their preferences. What does it sound and look like? I mean, are you worried about...\n\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...The unity of the party?\n\nFULLER CLARK: No. I think everybody is unified on the issue that we cannot allow Trump a second term and that everybody is going to come together at the end of the primary with whoever the candidate is.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We will have to wait and see. That is New Hampshire state Senator Martha Fuller Clark.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

He's Not The Palestinian President, But He Played One On TV\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Schifrin/NPR Nick Schifrin/NPR\n\nThe streets are packed on a recent Saturday afternoon in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government in the West Bank. As he weaves through the families and shoppers, 24-year-old Waad Qannam is the center of attention.\n\nDana Adiq, 27, stops Qannam to call him strong, cultured and intellectual.\n\nTasneem Hushiyea, who is 25, asks for his plans to help young Palestinians.\n\nAnd 23-year-old Annas Karoty addresses him by his title: The president of Palestine.\n\nQannam smiles brightly, but also a little bashfully. He's not the real Palestinian president. He just played one on TV.\n\nIn June, he won a TV show called The President, a reality show similar to American Idol. But instead of voting for its favorite singer, the Palestinian audience voted via text message for its favorite would-be leader.\n\nQannam beat out a diverse mix of 23 other contestants, who held election rallies and critiqued sitting ministers. He is from East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope will be the capital of a future state, and is the son of refugees — two traits he says made him popular in the West Bank.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Schifrin/NPR Nick Schifrin/NPR\n\nWhen he won, he dropped to his knees and cried.\n\nI felt that that moment was the key to giving the youth a chance to participate in Palestinian politics, Qannam says.\n\nThe show, broadcast on the Maan satellite network, was popular — and he is recognized on the streets of Ramallah — in part because he's the closest Palestinians have gotten to choosing a leader in more than a decade. The real president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a five-year term.\n\nThe program The President sends a very strong message to the [Palestinian] leadership and says, there is a real need for the democratic process, Qannam says. The second message that it gives is the interest on the part of the youth to participate in making their ideas heard.\n\n\n\nSeventy percent of Palestinians are under 30, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, and many describe themselves as politically starved. They're frustrated not only by a lack of elections but also by a lack of political and economic development. Some accuse the Palestinian leadership of being focused only on keeping itself and its closest supporters in power.\n\nThose age 18 and older will get their chance to make their voices heard Oct. 8. That's when Palestinians are scheduled to hold their first contested elections in 11 years. They will choose 416 spots on local councils, which help elect mayors and other local officials and help administer services such as power and water.\n\nAs of now, the election will include both major parties — Fatah, which largely runs the Palestinian Authority from Ramallah, and Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States.\n\nBut there are no plans for either a Palestinian legislative or presidential election.\n\nKaroty, who met Qannam during the show's taping and considers him a friend, calls the current Palestinian leadership out of touch.\n\nIt is time for us to get rid of people who have been sitting for years and have not done much for the people, Karoty says. Concerning the ones that have been keeping their seats as mayors and others for many, many years, we want to get rid of those people.\n\nQannam — perhaps trying out a politician's answer — is more diplomatic.\n\nWe do not seek to cancel the role of the older generation, says Qannam, who is a member of Fatah. We rather want to encourage our role, to find a role for us.\n\nHe says he met with Abbas and urged him to install a quota among the municipal representatives for young members. He says he has not heard back.\n\nThe only time that I will feel that the youth have an impact in Palestinian politics, Qannam says, is when I see the youth of Fatah or other parties playing a practical role in the running of the affairs of the country.\n\nIn the nearby Amari refugee camp, 29-year-old Mohannad Samara doubts that will ever happen. Between customers at his mirror and glass shop, he explains that he's an Islamist and fears that Hamas and other Islamist groups won't be allowed to fully participate.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad said our victory comes through the engagement of the youth, Samara says. But if Islamist youth gets engaged in the upcoming elections, they will either get arrested or cornered.\n\nHe believes the Palestinian Authority, run by Abbas, and Israel will team up to block young Islamists, either by preventing them from voting, arresting their members or not respecting the results of the vote.\n\nIt will be the first and foremost the Palestinian Authority that will block the youth, he says, and whatever the Palestinian Authority cannot carry out on its own, Israel will do it for them.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Israel's internal security services announced it arrested Hamas' election committee representative, accusing him of being a threat to local security. Hamas accused Israel of trying to influence the election.\n\nQannam is trying to fight youth cynicism. He stands in a group of young Palestinians in Ramallah, and 16-year-old Jihad Adnan asks him how he will increase youth participation in politics.\n\nQannam tries to convince them their voices will be heard. He is only a few moments into his pitch when he's interrupted by Hushiyea. She says she is desperate to talk to any leader, even a TV president. She challenges Qannam and asks how he could prevent nepotism.\n\nQannam seems prepared for that question.\n\nThe only way to deal with the issue of nepotism, he says, is to make Palestinian institutions bigger and put the right person and the most qualified person in that job.\n\nHe smiles and admits he might even run himself.
Reporter: White House Knew Of Coronavirus' 'Major Threat,' But Response Fell Short\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.\n\nDan Diamond, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.\n\nDAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.\n\nI think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.\n\nThe president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.\n\nAnd then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.\n\nBut at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. As I was walking into the studio, Terry, I saw the European Union had put out a statement slamming the U.S. for taking this step without even informing them.\n\nGROSS: What are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.\n\nGROSS: We seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. The NBA suspended the season. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. So have we reached a new stage? And what does that mean?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in many ways, the World Health Organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. This virus is here. It is around the world. It is spreading. It is putting many people at risk.\n\nBut I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. A lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the United States.\n\nAt the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of Americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.\n\nGROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?\n\nDIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.\n\nCities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.\n\nBut at this point, we do not have, from the White House, any clear directive on what the country should do. And with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.\n\nGROSS: You know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the Trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. What went wrong?\n\nDIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.\n\nThe CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.\n\nGROSS: And it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.\n\nDIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.\n\nGROSS: Why didn't the U.S. use the World Health Organization's test?\n\nDIAMOND: If you or your listeners know the answer to that, I would love...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.\n\nGROSS: It's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the United States is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.\n\nDIAMOND: I think at this point, Terry, South Korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the United States has done in the past two months. South Korea can do 10,000 tests per day. At last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.\n\nGROSS: What do you think the impact is of the lost time?\n\nDIAMOND: I think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and I think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. We are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the United States. If there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.\n\nSome of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S DERVISH)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?\n\nDIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.\n\nAt the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.\n\nAnd I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.\n\nGROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.\n\nAnd when I look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. The president has driven a lot of those people away. That has weakened the response across government. It has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. And in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.\n\nGROSS: Are there cuts the Trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? For example, wasn't there a National Security Council health task force that was disbanded under Trump?\n\nDIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.\n\nGROSS: Something I found very interesting - and I'd love to hear your take on this - is that Tucker Carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on Fox News - he has been one of Trump's strongest advocates. And Trump seems to listen, you know, to watch Tucker Carlson's show. So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself. What do you make of that?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.\n\nThe president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. After a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WOJCIECHOWSKI'S TWIRL)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.\n\nSo how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.\n\nDIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.\n\nWhat's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.\n\nGROSS: What is it about his management style that's so alienating?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. But his critics would say that Alex Azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.\n\nGROSS: My impression is that he is anti-abortion. He has described HHS as the department of life. He described the Trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. He said that in a very admiring way. How has that affected him as the leader of HHS? And was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?\n\nDIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.\n\nWhat that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.\n\nGROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.\n\nDIAMOND: Oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.\n\nGROSS: OK. Thank you for the (laughter) clarification. So how does their desire to please Trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? And that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.\n\nDIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nMore recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Azar has been the point person on President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices. Azar has pitched himself as the fixer. He worked in the drug industry at Eli Lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.\n\nWhen the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, and he's been covering the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nSo you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?\n\nDIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.\n\nBut at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a look at Robert Redfield, who's the head of the Centers for Disease Control. And he was a well-known AIDS researcher, and you say he was a favorite of Christian conservatives when Trump appointed him in 2018. He helped fight HIV-AIDS in Africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nDIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.\n\nThose views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.\n\nGROSS: So is there a decision, for better or worse, that Redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the U.S. for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.\n\nGROSS: Vice President Pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. Seema Verma, who is the head of Medicare and Medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of Indiana. Jerome Adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the Pence administration. When Alex Azar was in Indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he became connected to Mike Pence.\n\nSo it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.\n\nDIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.\n\nWhile Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.\n\nBut I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' SMALL PLANET)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico. He investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nIn your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?\n\nDIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.\n\nAnd the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.\n\nThat story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back. I'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.\n\nGROSS: What's another?\n\nDIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.\n\nBehind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.\n\nGROSS: Like on fighting the virus, not on fighting for his job (laughter).\n\nDIAMOND: Yes, on fighting the threat to the American people, not fighting who has which title.\n\nGROSS: Is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the U.S.?\n\nDIAMOND: The information that I have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. One reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.\n\nIn a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.\n\nThe efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. There's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.\n\nGROSS: All right, well, thank you so much for your reporting, and thank you for being on our show.

Wolf sets goal for Pa. to cut greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGov. Tom Wolf has set a new goal for the state to combat climate change: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025.\n\nLong-term, the governor wants to see an 80-percent reduction by 2050.\n\nHe announced the goals Tuesday in Pittsburgh, saying they are based off the state's 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels.\n\nWe're about halfway there, which means we have work to do, he said.\n\nThe goals stem from the state's draft Climate Action Plan, released in November by the Department of Environmental Protection. The draft states that if every state and nation met comparable goals, global temperature rise could be kept below the 2-degree Celsius threshold that experts say is necessary to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change.\n\nIn his announcement, Wolf called for more wind and solar energy. He said he is open to beefing up the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — which requires utilities to buy certain amounts of power from alternative sources — though that would require the Republican-controlled legislature to act.\n\nWolf also cited recent efforts already underway to reduce emissions, such as a proposed rule to cut methane emissions from natural gas well sites and a new law bolstering in-state solar energy.\n\nWolf did not say whether the state should act to help the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power generation does not release carbon emissions, but it's struggling to compete with cheap natural gas and renewables.\n\nI haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, Wolf said.\n\nAsked about emissions tied to the state's growing petrochemical industry — including an ethane cracker plant under construction in Beaver County — he indicated his support for the industry.\n\nWolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like Shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.\n\nIf you want an either-or situation, I'm not your guy, he said. I want to do both. I want to have an energy efficient future, I want to have a strong environment and I want to have a good economy in Pennsylvania, and I think we can do all of those things.\n\nThe shift away from coal-fired electricity to natural gas power generation has helped the state achieve greenhouse gas reductions below its 2005 levels, according to the state's draft climate action plan.\n\nWe encourage policymakers, including Gov. Wolf, to support common-sense energy and climate-related solutions that encourage responsible natural gas production and use given the overwhelmingly clear benefits of this American resource, said David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade group for Pennsylvania's natural gas industry.\n\nMany environmental groups praised Wolf's emissions reduction goals, including the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nAndrew Williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for EDF, said Wolf's efforts to cut methane emissions are a good step. To achieve major reductions, he said he would like to see even more action.\n\nThere needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.\n\nA program like that would set a limit on the state's emissions and allow companies to buy or sell allowances based on what they emit. Other northeast states have joined together to form a regional cap-and-trade program, but Pennsylvania is not a member.\n\nSome environmental groups urged the governor to be far more ambitious in setting goals. Food & Water Watch, for one, said the state should aim for 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 with significant job growth in clean energy.\n\nWolf on Tuesday also announced the GreenGov Council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. The council has several of its own targets:\n\nA 3 percent reduction in overall energy consumption per year.\n\nReplace 25 percent of the state car fleet with electric vehicles by 2025.\n\nOffset at least 40 percent of the commonwealth's annual electricity usage with renewable energy.\n\nEditor's Picks
Trump Hosts Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump wants to see Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace deal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There is no reason there's not peace between Israel and the Palestinians, none whatsoever.\n\nINSKEEP: And today, President Trump hosts Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House. We're going to talk about this with Ghaith al-Omari, who is here in our studios. He served in various positions within the Palestinian Authority. Thanks for coming by.\n\nGHAITH AL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: Is President Trump, from a Palestinian point of view, an honest broker?\n\nAL-OMARI: You know, the issue of an honest broker is not an issue that the Palestinians think about too much. For the Palestinians, the U.S. is an effective broker. And that's much more important than things like honest or in certain such abstract concepts.\n\nINSKEEP: And so are you hopeful that President Trump is a person who could move Israelis and Palestinians toward a two-state solution or a solution? He doesn't seem to care what the solution is.\n\nAL-OMARI: What is very clear is that he is committed towards doing something. What is less clear is how he is going to do it. Things are complicated. The issues are complicated. There is no trust between the leaders. And on the Palestinian side, at least, there are domestic political problems that can be an obstacle and so in Israel. So unless we deal with these, I don't see how we can move forward.\n\nINSKEEP: I guess one of the domestic political problems is whether Mahmoud Abbas is really the leader of the Palestinians, given that Hamas has great power, and he doesn't control all the territory.\n\nAL-OMARI: That's one of the problems, the Hamas-PA split with Hamas controlling Gaza, the PA, the West Bank. But even within the West Bank itself, there are challenges to his legitimacy from his own political party. There has been no election for around 14 years now. So these are all issues that has to - have to be dealt with before we can actually make the difficult decisions needed for peace to be achieved.\n\nINSKEEP: So President Trump from the outside can seem to have evolved on this. He started out in the campaign saying, first thing when I'm elected, I'm going to move the Israeli - the embassy, the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which would effectively recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Then he backed off of that. Then he advised Israel against building more settlements. What's happening to the president?\n\nAL-OMARI: I think what's happening is when you sit in that office, you realize that there are complexities, there are national interest concerns that you simply don't see from the outside. And I think his policy, whether to this conflict or to the Middle East in general, has evolved as he saw the complexities and what is at stake for the United States in the region.\n\nINSKEEP: You think he saw the complexities. You think he actually has learned and changed here?\n\nAL-OMARI: What we see right now is indications that we have a more realistic, more grounded policy, at least that's the indications. Whether this will be turned into concrete policies, it's too early to tell. It's only been three months. But certainly the trajectory is very different from what we see - what we saw from Trump as a candidate versus Trump the president.\n\nINSKEEP: What's the role of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner?\n\nAL-OMARI: That's also quite vague at the moment. He's in charge of the file, but he has remained very silent about it. The day-to-day management is done by the president's peace envoy, Mr. Jason Greenblatt. Kushner remains as the overall figure. But we have not seen any direct engagement from him, so it remains a bit murky.\n\nINSKEEP: Assuming that this does end up as a two-state solution, if it were to, let me just ask one bottom-line question. There are people who doubt whether Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu is serious about endorsing a two-state solution even though he's formally endorsed it. Of course, the opposite question is posed to President Abbas.\n\nWhen I've moved around the West Bank, I see maps of Palestine - Palestine including all of Israel. Are Palestinians really ready to recognize Israel as a country, and as Israelis would want, as a Jewish state?\n\nAL-OMARI: I think if the right conditions are there, if the right package that includes resolution of all of the issues is there, Palestinians would be ready. Will they fall in love with Israel? Most likely not. Will we have a peace that is stable? I think so. Look at the peace that Israel had with Egypt and Jordan.\n\nEgyptians and Jordanians are no big fans of Israel, yet the peace itself stuck. If the two sides get their interests met - their interests for the Palestinians is about independence and dignity - they would be - you would have a stable peace deal. For the Israelis, it's about security and recognition. You get these components, you get a peace. Peace is not about love. It's about accommodation.\n\nINSKEEP: A cold peace, as people have said.\n\nAL-OMARI: A cold peace is better than a warm conflict.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Ghaith al-Omari, thank you very much for coming by, really appreciate it.\n\nAL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: He is currently with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Critics Say Israel's Nation State Law Discriminates Against Religious Minorities\n\nIsrael passed a law last month that is still causing controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. The Druze religious minority held a weekend protest.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nIsrael passed a law last month that continues to cause controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Critics say this law discriminates against religious minorities like Muslims and Christians who make up about a fifth of the Israeli population. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv, this law is sparking protest from a religious group that's one of Israel's staunchest supporters.\n\nDANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: The Druze religious minority in Israel held an unprecedented protest this weekend. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's main square chanting the Hebrew word for equality - shivayon (ph).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Shivayon. Shivayon. Shivayon.\n\nESTRIN: The Druze are a religious group, an offshoot of Islam. They're ethnic Arabs. But unlike most other Arab citizens, they've committed to serving in the Israeli army. They get a lot of praise from Israeli leaders, and they're outspoken Israeli patriots, which is why it was unusual for the Israeli Druze community's religious leader, sheikh Moafaq Tarif, to say this at the protest.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nMOAFAQ TARIF: (Through interpreter) Despite our unquestioned loyalty to the country, the country does not see us as equal.\n\nESTRIN: After impassioned debate, Israeli lawmakers narrowly passed the Nation State law last month. The law downgrades the Arabic language in Israel from official to special status and commits resources to Jewish settlement. Critics say that could lead to an unequal distribution of land and resources. Palestinian-Arab citizens have long complained of discrimination, but the Druze community's outcry is something new.\n\nANWAR SAEB: They put all the Jewish under this law and others out of this law.\n\nESTRIN: Anwar Saeb is one of the senior Druze reserve army officers leading the protest. He heads a company that produces drones for the Israeli military. He served in the army for 27 years and commanded an infantry unit.\n\nSAEB: I was injured three times in Lebanon, in Gaza and in the West Bank - my hand, my chest and my ears.\n\nESTRIN: He's part of a Druze delegation that's been meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSAEB: I told the prime minister that we are not guests here. We are the real citizens, and we do actually the whole commitments. And we need to get all the rights.\n\nESTRIN: Netanyahu defended the new Nation State law yesterday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking in Hebrew).\n\nESTRIN: He said the law does not infringe upon individual rights of citizens but does prevent collective national rights for non-Jews. He said the law would ensure Israel accepts Jewish immigrants while preventing Palestinian noncitizens from gaining citizenship. Israeli columnist Shmuel Rosner says many Israelis support the law, partly in reaction to international activists leading a boycott campaign against Israel.\n\nSHMUEL ROSNER: A sense within Israel and among many Israelis that there is a growing tendency to delegitimize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, to somehow argue that even being a nation-state is in some way not legitimate. So many Israelis feel as if Israel is under siege, and they felt the need to make a statement.\n\nESTRIN: Netanyahu has tried to smooth things over with the Druze community. He's proposed laws to invest in the community and to guarantee benefits for religious minorities who serve in the military. But he has not agreed to a Druze demand to amend the Nation State law with language ensuring equality for all minorities. Druze representative Saeb is torn.\n\nSAEB: Now the country going very, very extreme to the right. It's not good for this country. This is a democratic country. It's a great country. I want to still live in Israel. It's my country. I love this country. My son today is in the army.\n\nESTRIN: Druze protesters have found allies among some former top military and defense officials, including from the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies who came to this weekend's protest. The Jewish Federations of North America, a nonpartisan umbrella group of U.S. Jewish communities, offered rare criticism of Israeli policy. It says the Nation State law is, quote, a step back for all minorities. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Living Well Now: What Does It Take?\n\nRandall Curren is a professor of philosophy at the University of Rochester. His work spans sustainability studies, the philosophy and psychology of well-being, social and political philosophy, and ancient Greek philosophy. You can follow his work here.\n\nParenting, teaching and leading all require us to believe in the prospects for living well on this planet — and to have confidence in our capacity to equip others to live well without destroying those prospects for others.\n\nThese roles require us to both hold these beliefs and to be spokespersons for the world — ones who can make our belief in a future of opportunity credible to those we must raise, teach and lead.\n\nWhatever forms these endeavors might take in the absence of such credible belief and confidence, they would not succeed in their proper ends. They would not enable the human beings we influence to live well together.\n\nHowever, as a society we have barely begun to think about what is essential to preserving opportunity to live well.\n\nOur policies have been dominated by the idea that a growing economy is what best enables everyone to find happiness in their own way, even as evidence has mounted that the damaging impact of human activities on planetary systems makes the explosive economic growth of recent decades unsustainable. The emergence of sustainability science, movement toward a post-carbon economy, and greater consideration of the environmental impacts of personal and institutional decisions are all signs that we are at least beginning to come to grips with the reality that we cannot persist in destabilizing the natural systems on which humanity relies without suffering severe and ultimately irreversible consequences.\n\nThe recognition that preserving opportunities to live well requires preserving the integrity of the natural systems on which we rely is a critical first step. Identifying the distinct forms of human impact and critical thresholds or planetary boundaries is an important further step that has been underway for some time. Nine such boundaries have been identified, including safe rates of biodiversity loss, nitrogen removal from the atmosphere, phosphorus flowing into the oceans, consumption of freshwater, and land cover converted to cropland. From a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the Paris climate accord.\n\nWithin the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. A central argument of my book, Living Well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously — and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.\n\nA central feature of Americans' understanding and promotion of opportunity to live well has been a focused on fair terms of access to employment. Promoting fair competition for employment and equal access to the education and training needed to acquire job qualifications makes sense.\n\nHowever, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. The evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. Comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. Nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.\n\nTo make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. And we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. Those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).\n\nSo what is inherently involved in living well?\n\nIn addressing this question, my geoscientist coauthor Ellen Metzger and I have had the benefit of collaborations with psychologist colleagues, Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. Their research in self-determination theory, conducted over the course of four decades with a network of 500 collaborators in 39 countries, has found that the experience of happiness is regulated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs to feel competent, self-determining, and positively related to other people in the activities of one's life. These are universal needs, observed across all stages of life and in every culture in which studies have been conducted, and they help explain the truth in the ancient ideal of eudaimonia, or human flourishing.\n\nAccording to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. My work with Ryan and Deci identifies three broad forms of potential — social, intellectual, and productive/creative — the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. Fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.\n\nA related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. Societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. It should be evident to any observer of life in the U.S. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most Americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may seem, we could be happier both now and in the future if we could overcome the blind faith in wealth accumulation that shaped the socially, politically and environmentally unstable world with which we must now contend.
Bloomberg Promises $15 Million To Help Make Up For U.S. Withdrawal From Climate Deal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christophe Ena/AP Christophe Ena/AP\n\nMichael Bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.\n\nAmericans will honor and fulfill the Paris Agreement by leading from the bottom up — and there isn't anything Washington can do to stop us, said Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who now serves as the U.N.'s special envoy on cities and climate change.\n\nMayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing [on to] a statement of support that we will submit to the U.N., Bloomberg said, and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the U.S. made in Paris in 2015.\n\nDozens of cities have said they are committed to the Paris climate accord, with at least 86 mayors signing a statement saying they will adopt and uphold the agreement's goals.\n\nUnder the Paris accord, the U.S. sent some $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund that is guided by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. The U.S. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but Trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.\n\nBloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the U.N.'s climate change agency.\n\nWe are grateful to Bloomberg Philanthropies for this generous contribution, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a news release about the funding pledge.\n\nWhile government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\n\nThe announcement follows Trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that nearly 200 nations agreed to in late 2015. As NPR has reported, the only other countries not part of the agreement are Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which argued that the Paris accord did not go far enough to curb global emissions.\n\nThe architects of the Paris Agreement included Christiana Figueres, who until recently led the UNFCCC.\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris deal sparked pledges of money and solidarity, Figueres said via Twitter on Friday, Thank you Trump. You have provoked an unparalleled wave of support for Paris and determined resolve on climate action. Deeply grateful.
Republicans Now Poised For Biden-Burisma Subpoena With Romney On Board\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nSen. Mitt Romney has cleared the path for his Republican colleagues to intensify their investigation next week into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter.\n\nThe Utah Republican said Friday that he'll go along with his fellow members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and authorize a subpoena as part of an investigation into what Republicans call potential conflicts of interest from Biden's tenure in office.\n\nRomney had wavered about joining the other Republicans on the panel, who control the majority but would have needed him to break a tie if all the Democrats present opposed a subpoena.\n\nOn Friday, a spokeswoman said that Romney and Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the committee, reached an accord that made Romney comfortable with going along.\n\nSenator Romney has expressed his concerns to Chairman Johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle, said spokeswoman Liz Johnson. He will therefore vote to let the chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.\n\nJohnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have been seeking interviews with witnesses and documents about Hunter Biden for several months. They've contacted the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and a political consultancy, Blue Star Strategies — among others — with requests for responses.\n\nJohnson and Grassley, who is not on the homeland security committee, have said they haven't gotten satisfactory responses to their formal requests, which is why Johnson's committee is expected to begin issuing subpoenas now that Romney is on board.\n\nJohnson wants to subpoena records and an interview from Andrii Telizhenko, a former consultant for Blue Star. The Wisconsin senator says he wants to find out more about accounts that Blue Star, which represented Ukraine, sought access to Hunter Biden in order to gain access to Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time, and to influence the State Department.\n\nThe Republicans' latest actions putting the Biden investigation back into the spotlight have followed Joe Biden's successes in the Democratic primaries, reviving his prospects of becoming the party's presidential nominee.\n\nThe Burisma connection\n\nHunter Biden made lucrative business connections at a time when Joe Biden was handling key foreign policy matters for President Barack Obama.\n\nThe younger Biden was paid as a member of the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and also received payments and, reportedly, gifts from Chinese business counterparts.\n\nThe Bidens traveled together to China aboard Air Force Two during the time Joe Biden was vice president. Johnson and Grassley also have asked DHS, which oversees the Secret Service, whether it has records about other trips they might have made.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign has been embarrassed by the consistent exhumations about that story, but the men haven't been accused of any lawbreaking.\n\nTrump's desire for Ukraine to launch an investigation into the Bidens' activities was one basis for the actions in the Ukraine affair for which he was impeached last year and then acquitted earlier this year.\n\nRomney has played a key role all throughout as one of a handful of Republicans who've been willing to break with Trump. Romney cast the lone GOP vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment in Senate.
Facebook Taps Former Obama Official As Vice President Of Civil Rights\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Facebook Facebook\n\nSocial media behemoth Facebook announced Monday it has created a new executive role at the company and that it will be filled by a veteran of the Obama administration.\n\nRoy Austin Jr. has been named vice president of civil rights with the mandate to oversee Facebook's accountability on racial hatred and discrimination on its platform. He's slated to start Jan. 19.\n\nNaming Austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.\n\nThe auditors had several recommendations, such as calling on Facebook to do more to rein in hateful speech on its platform, and stricter penalties for users who post items that violate company standards.\n\nThe auditors also advised Facebook to create a position to lead the company's efforts on civil rights, even after acknowledging the company had taken several positive steps in that direction. Those included barring advertisers from using tools that target housing, employment and credit ads at individuals based on gender, age or ZIP code.\n\nI am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, Austin said in a statement.\n\nTechnology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it's important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it, he added.\n\nFacebook said Austin will be based out of Washington, D.C.\n\nHe comes from the law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, where he was a partner focusing on criminal defense and civil rights law. Earlier in his career, Austin held several positions within the U.S. Justice Department, including senior assistant U.S. attorney in the Civil Rights Unit of the Washington, D.C., U.S Attorney's office, and deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from 2010 to 2014.\n\nAfter that Austin worked on the White House Domestic Policy Council in the Obama administration. He also worked on President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and was a member of Obama's My Brother's Keeper Task Force.\n\nLaura Murphy, a former American Civil Liberties Union executive, who was hired by Facebook to lead a two-year investigation into the company's polices, applauded Austin's hire.\n\nThe appointment of a Civil Rights Vice President is an historic, positive and timely milestone in the evolution of Facebook, Murphy said in a statement.\n\nRoy Austin is a great choice for this role; I worked with him extensively during his tenure at the White House. I urge Facebook to give him the latitude and resources to tackle the audit recommendations and any other civil rights issues that arise, she added.\n\nJust how much latitude Austin ultimately gets remains to be seen.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, has the final say in any decision made at Facebook.\n\nPressure has been building for Facebook to implement changes to its platform following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police on Memorial Day.\n\nThe audit was released in the immediate weeks following Floyd's killing, just as national protests calling for a reckoning on race, police brutality and social injustice were gaining momentum.\n\nAs NPR's Shannon Bond reported in July, the audit of Facebook came at the same time hundreds of companies pledged to pull advertising from the platform to protest its lax approach to policing harmful posts.\n\nBond also reported at the time that advocacy groups, including Color of Change, the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League held a conference call with Facebook executives to press for change, but hung up disappointed with the social media network's response.\n\nThey showed up to the meeting expecting an 'A' for attendance, Rashad Robinson, President of Color of Change told NPR at the time.\n\nEditor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.\n\nNPR's Shannon Bond contributed to this report.
President-Elect Trump Eyes Rex Tillerson As Possible Secretary Of State\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nThis weekend, reports emerged saying the CIA believes Russian hacking during the U.S. presidential election was intended to sway the election in favor of Donald Trump. The president-elect had this to say on Fox News this morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know why. And I think it's just, you know, they talk about all sorts of things. Every week, it's another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\n\nCHANG: Joining us now to talk more about Russian hacking and Trump's possible pick for secretary of state is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: So what do you make of Trump's reaction to the latest news on the Russian hacking?\n\nLIASSON: Well, it was pretty extraordinary. He rejected the consensus view of the intelligence community, that Russia wasn't just interfering in the elections to sow chaos, actually trying to put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump. He put out an official statement - not a tweet - where he insulted the intelligence community, said these are the same people who brought us flawed intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction. He also suggested this morning that President Obama might be trying to undercut his win, which, although it was decisive and even stunning, it was certainly not historic landslide, as Trump just described it, because his 306 electoral votes rank him 46th out of 58 Electoral College victories.\n\nThe other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. He said in that interview on Fox, he says I'm a very smart person. I don't need briefings every day. I don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. And that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about China or North Korea or Iran? Is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?\n\nCHANG: There was also some reaction from Congress this morning. We saw a statement from a bipartisan group of senators. They said this is not a partisan issue. What do you make of that?\n\nLIASSON: Well, what I make of it is there's not only a big breach between Trump and the intelligence community. There's also a breach between Trump and a bipartisan group of senators on Capitol Hill who say there should be hearings. There was the initial reaction from some Republicans where they didn't want to undermine Trump's victory, but other Republicans want to get to the bottom of this. They consider this a cyberattack. They don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. We also have the report that the Obama administration has asked for to be completed before Obama leaves office. That means it would probably come out right before Trump's inauguration.\n\nCHANG: OK. So now let's talk about the secretary of state nomination. The front-runner now, according to multiple news outlets, is oil executive Rex Tillerson. He's the CEO of ExxonMobil. No confirmation yet, but if Trump chooses Tillerson, what would that say about his foreign policy plans, and what does that signal to the rest of the world?\n\nLIASSON: I think it signals that he might be ready to break with 70 years of bipartisan foreign policy consensus about America's role in the world. Rex Tillerson has been described as the most friendliest-to-Putin American executive. Runs ExxonMobil - ExxonMobil would benefit, of course, if sanctions against Russia for taking Crimea were lifted. Vladimir Putin personally gave Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013. And I think it's raising some alarm bells on the Hill. We have Lindsey Graham and John McCain, two Republican senators, suggesting that Tillerson might have the hardest time of all the Trump national security nominations up in the Senate. They're going to ask him some very tough questions about Russia.\n\nCHANG: NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.
