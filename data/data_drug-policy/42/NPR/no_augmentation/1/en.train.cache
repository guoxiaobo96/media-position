but the vaccination campaign has gotten off to a sluggish start in the u.s. instead of 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020 — a frequent promise of the trump administration — only around 6 million people have gotten their first dose so far. explanations for this include the holidays, snowstorms and the need to train health care workers to give the shots.
inskeep: really appreciate it. that's npr white house correspondent scott horsley on this day when the president is on the way to make an announcement about cuba but is making much other news besides.
you know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. i had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently, newsom told kqed. it allowed me to think outside the box. i've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.
democrats certainly don't want to couple those programs with tax cuts they feel overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. you didn't hear much of anything about working families, oregon democrat ron wyden told politico. i'm certainly not going to support a tax proposal that gives crumbs to working families and cakes to the fortunate few.
for some, though, the idea of having more children could prove a difficult sell. as bloomberg notes, high living costs, long work hours and surging child-care expenses mean that many couples feel that they can only afford to have one child — or none. a survey by zhaopin.com, a job recruitment site, found that 33 percent of women had their pay cut after giving birth and 36 percent were demoted.
i did a portrait of [jacquelyne kay] with her arms around [husband sgt. tim johannsen] in a wheelchair. and it became what i saw as this transference of power. she's his wife and saying, i've got him home now, no one is going to hurt him anymore. the picture is divided into two halves. i remember thinking consciously, do i show his legs cut off? maybe i should be more sanitized about it. then i thought, no. you have to acknowledge both — the love and tenderness, and the brutality, danger, pain and trauma that's also there.

mr. allen: in other words, there would be some kind of criminal prosecution. look, i - first of all, i'm dreadfully sorry for what happened to you, and i'm glad that, ultimately, you are able to prevail. i don't know exactly what should happen, because i know that the vatican has to set policy for a global church. but i do know that when i talk to just ordinary people, the kinds of disappointment that bette is describing, particularly about how the bishops seem - how the church seems to have dealt with its priest problem, but not its bishop's problem - that, to me, does seem to be the single biggest sort of neuralgic point in all of this. and somehow...

noorani's workers will choose from a few investment options. these plans are similar to state-designed 529 college savings plans. the state creates the framework, but the investments are managed by a private company — in oregon's case it's state street global advisors.
that diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of americans have a positive view of socialism. socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. since trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.
harder to change are formal regulations, such as one effectively banning planned parenthood from the federal family planning program, title x. they are governed by a law, the administrative procedure act, that lays out a very specific — and often time-consuming — process. you have to cross your i's and dot your legal t's, said nicholas bagley, who teaches administrative law at the university of michigan law school.

mary louise kelly, byline: in the crowded shipping lanes of the persian gulf, iran and the u.s. have long played a game of cat and mouse. lately, the mouse has been poking hard. this month, an iranian vessel came within 100 yards of a u.s. navy ship. and remember the confrontation in january, when iran took u.s. sailors into custody after their ship strayed into iranian territorial waters. the u.s. has condemned iran's actions. at his florida campaign stop, trump advocated going considerably farther.

fadel: i'm curious, though - a meeting like this, how much water does it hold with a leader like president zelenskiy? president trump has a history of contradicting people in his own administration on policy issues, so when you go into this meeting, do they have faith that you're bringing a real message from the u.s.?
in addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of faqs provided to npr by ocasio-cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals:
the proposed law would make it legal for anyone over the age of 18 to possess marijuana, provided that it is less than 30 grams (just over an ounce). it also allows canadians to grow up to four marijuana plants in their home.

and the way that i think about it is that i have to insist all the time that i am not an immigrant and that i - the story that i'm telling in my novel is not an immigrant story. i'm a refugee and the story i'm telling is a war story because one of the ways that the united states tries to contain the meaning of these histories is to think that all of these asians are here because they're immigrants, and that their story begins once they get to the united states. but again, my understanding is that many of these asians are here because of the consequences of wars. and many immigrant stories and refugee stories need to be understood as war stories.

desantis: my concern is simply that, you know, we have worked so hard to make sure we have adequate hospital space in the event of a covid-19 surge that we wouldn't want, you know, those valuable beds to be taken because of the cruise ship.

nobody thinks legislation can end this [coronavirus crisis], mcconnell said wednesday. we cannot outlaw the virus. and no economic policy can fully end the hardship so long as the public health requires that we put so much of our commerce on ice. this isn't even a stimulus package. it is emergency relief. that's what this is.
klobuchar was one of four senators still running for president while also serving as jurors in the impeachment trial of trump. the trial's schedule disrupted the final weeks of campaigning around the hawkeye state.
even as there is increasing demand, there are fewer resources to care for psychiatric patients. it can be difficult for doctors to find an inpatient bed — the numbers are have decreased dramatically over the decades. rogers says there have been significant cuts to community and outpatient resources — so the emergency department is often the only place for psychiatric patients to go.
not every mission is going to have those stats you look for — enemy killed in action, enemy wounded in action, the team leader said. it really is about the overall objective. and so it may seem frustrating, because obviously, at all points, you want to engage the enemy. but as long as the mission is accomplished, it is good for everybody.

bouie: because of the brownness of the democratic party, because that democratic party is increasingly college educated - much like nationally, the democratic party in virginia no longer wins the votes of what you would, i guess, call working-class whites. its white support comes from college-educated whites in northern virginia and then throughout the state where there's sort of high concentrations of them, like in charlottesville.

trump said this week he might consider jan brewer, the former governor of arizona, who shares his position on immigration, or joni ernst, a freshman senator elected with tea party support. ernst has been critical of trump's comments about women, but she hasn't ruled out taking the vp spot. trump's negatives with women are sky high. a woman on the ticket might help. plus, ernst is from the swing state of iowa.

under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came. and they'll be brought great distances; we're not dropping them right across. they learned that, president eisenhower, they dropped them across, right across, and they'd come back. then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. we will take them great distances, but we will take them to the country where they came from. ok?
joanne silberner: well, picture a tiny tube. its very small. it's small enough to fit inside a blood vessel. its steel mesh and its put at the end of a catheter, something - they can actually push this tube up and around. it goes up, usually through your groin. they feed it through blood vessels. it gets to your heart blood vessel, the one thats blocked. there is, actually, also a little, tiny balloon inside this little, tiny, steel mesh stent. the balloon is inflated. that pushes the stent up so that its holding that artery open, so that the blood flow can go through. and that prevents a heart attack from developing.

arnold: so driscoll says he's happy to see that cohn's in the president's inner circle. but critics say, while all that may be true, cohn is also putting wall street ahead of main street. cohn stood by the president's side as he signed an executive order that in effect suspends a rule from the obama administration, a rule that says financial advisers need to act in their client's best interest. here's cohn on cnbc.
anderson: i think it's easier to notice when congress changes the law than these incremental changes inside government bureaucracies. and what we've seen is the travel ban, a measure on what's called extreme vetting of visas, a buy american and hire american executive order and the public charge change by the state department. and when you combine all those together, what we've seen is decreases in legal immigration, and even in people trying to come here as tourists or as students.

natapoff: so fees are different than fines. a fine is a punishment. it's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. it's typically set by statute. the judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. but fees are not punishment. they are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. they're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.

women using these services in cities say they like the speed and no-hassle privacy they get by making a purchase through the app. and in some rural areas where women's health clinics are few and far between, being able to buy prescription contraceptives online — starting at around $15 for a month's supply — can be not only much more private, but much more affordable and less time-consuming than driving an hour or more to the closest clinic, or paying for a doctor's appointment.
he had said in a november debate of the current $7.25 federal wage, i hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. yet, last month, he said he was open to doing something about the wage because he's very different from most republicans. but it's unclear what trump would do exactly. there is no policy position on his website relating to education or the minimum wage in any way.
[the children's health insurance program insures more than 8 million children annually and costs more than $13 billion. insuring 3 million more kids represents an increase of about 37 percent. when you factor that increase into the cost, you'll see an increase slightly under $5 billion — which is probably what makes the word nearly important in this claim. - meg anderson]

liasson: well, you're right. in a lot of ways, this campaign is frozen. even though, if you turn on your tv in a battleground state, you will still see lots of attack ads against both trump and biden. but, yes, biden is being deprived of oxygen. he's kind of stuck in his makeshift tv studio in his basement. most people are interested in hearing from democratic governors, like andrew cuomo, who are on the front lines of this pandemic. so it is harder for him to fundraise and unite the party.

arthur laffer: i think they are terrific. i think the corporate tax in the u.s. today is not only global in scope, which is a mistake - we have the single highest tax rate in the oecd - and it's discouraging businesses, jobs, output, employment coming to the u.s. it's driving business away through inversions and through formation of companies elsewhere. dropping that tax rate to 15 percent would have a huge impact on the u.s. economy and would have very little impact, if any, on tax revenues from corporations, from businesses.

biden will flip this logic. the president-elect has outlined concrete diplomatic objectives concerning iran — including reaffirming the importance of the 2015 nuclear agreement. the nuclear deal, signed by iran and six world powers, imposed limits on iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. biden and his team, which played key roles in securing that agreement when he was vice president, have proved they can negotiate in good faith and keep their word. by taking a more realistic approach, biden can unlock the power of the leverage trump accumulated.

they were not close calls on the merits, o'connell says. why get involved with this? it only hurts the military, hurts the rule of law and hurts the image of the u.s. as a law-abiding nation.
it was a [simulated] nighttime patrol mission. i just lay there. he steps over me and just carries on walking. i wanted to say, but i'm a new yorker photographer! i'm just here doing portraits! but obviously you daren't speak.

hud's new guidance warns that landlords could be breaking the law when they refuse to rent to people with criminal records — even if they have no intention to discriminate — because such a policy would likely have a disproportionate impact on african-american and hispanic applicants.
gross: something else that didn't work out as planned - mark zuckerberg was hoping to use his hundred million dollars to, in part, negotiate different contracts with teachers to have more flexibility in who got hired and who got fired and who got placed in what school. and then he found out something he didn't know initially, which was the seniority thing was controlled by new jersey law.
a former harvard law professor whose research on personal bankruptcy led her shaped her progressive outlook, warren entered politics via her interest in policy. she was a key architect of portions of the 2010 dodd-frank financial overhaul bill, especially around the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau. but she could not secure senate confirmation to lead the agency and wound up successfully challenging gop sen. scott brown in 2012.
on june 6, trump signed a law designating the courthouse on church street in nashville, tenn., as the fred d. thompson federal building and united states courthouse. thompson served in the senate, representing tennessee from 1994 to 2003 and briefly ran for president in 2008. but he is best known for playing district attorney arthur branch on the long-running police procedural drama law and order on nbc. he died in 2015. there was no formal signing ceremony for that bill.

nguyen: it's my revenge on hollywood (laughter). and, you know, my lonely, small effort - not even lovely and small. many vietnamese-american artists and writers are doing very similar things to try to get americans to understand that vietnam is a country and not a war. and they're also trying to get vietnamese people to understand this war in a different way, too, because the vietnamese understanding of it in vietnam is equally problematic from a very different way. but, you know, we write novels. and what that means is my novel, even though it won this prize, is just a book.
graves: this is a new trend. and it's a growing trend, where we see state legislatures intervening in local actions on a variety of issues, including local measures to increase minimum wage, to provide for paid sick leave for workers, to address fracking - which involves the hydraulic pressure drilling for natural gas in people's backyards almost literally. you also see measures, for instance in tennessee, where a city wanted to try to ensure that there were rewards for contractors who employed low-income workers or a small percentage - 10 percent - of low-income workers. that was preempted.
second, tehran is trying to create a ticking clock with its nuclear program. the parliament passed legislation that sets up a series of dates when iran is to take new nuclear steps. the most provocative next step, a significant reduction in international inspector access, is slated for late february. but these deadlines are purely artificial. iran's nuclear policy is ultimately under the control of khamenei, not the rambunctious, hawkish parliament or the lame-duck president. deadlines can and will be fudged depending on the overall political environment.

in both the screen and stage versions, beale's rants touch a nerve with his television audience and his ratings spike. the network executives seize the opportunity to build an entertainment program around his newscast: the anchor becomes a celebrity, and infotainment is born. keep in mind, screenwriter paddy chayefsky predicted this more than 40 years ago, and it won him an oscar.

hurt: you know, morale for republicans right now is low. this is more of the same in a way from president trump, questioning the election and putting really direct pressure on republicans that previously endorsed him and that he endorsed. but this is next-level. and there are republicans who are speaking out and saying, i'm - i've never felt this way before about it. and the question, though, of course, is, does this affect any republican voters? does this make anyone second-guess their vote? does this make anyone second-guess voting at all? and that is what is striking fear in the hearts of many republicans - has been for a while, but it has not eased up. in fact, this call has just made it worse.
some landowners agree to that, while others negotiate a lease that prohibits it, says attorney john mcfarland, who represents landowners with the texas-based law firm graves, dougherty, hearon and moody. many others sign leases that don't address it at all. even when possible deductions are addressed, mcfarland says, the lease language can be vague. that leaves room for a gas company to take deductions even if a landowner objects.

garcia-navarro: it's important to say at this point that the trump administration says this is not a religious ban. this is not a ban on muslims. this is to protect the country from terrorism. when we look at our foreign policy, we've already seen reaction from around the middle east. what do you think the effect is going to be in places like iran and iraq?
ever since donald trump entered the presidential race, his comments on illegal immigration have been pored over in the press — from vows to deport millions of people to promises that any enforcement plan would have a lot of heart. observers asked, again and again, how rhetoric would translate into actual policy.
we're not bringing a criminal case right now. we're not arresting anybody. we're not asking to forfeit property. we're not looking to be heavy-handed, mcswain says. this can serve everyone's interest, in order to find out what the court thinks of this. but this, in our view, is illegal.

garcia-navarro: there has been a lot of criticism, though, of some of the policies of not only ice but the border patrol agents. we've seen cases of what people feel are sort of egregious actions against undocumented people. there was a case last fall of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy. she had been brought over the border illegally when she was 3 months old. and then she was detained by immigration authorities in texas. can you speak to that? i mean, there is a concern that these expanded powers are being abused.

again, it's complicated. members of congress allowed them to unionize in the 1980s—but because of that, they couldn't be federal employees anymore. so they became private employees of these third-party contractors who took over the dining services in congress. as a result, they gained the right to unionize, but they lost their government health and other benefits. notably as you mentioned, their federal pension.

the tax overhaul gave most americans a break in what they owe the government; however, those tax gains were expected to be spread unevenly across income brackets, with high earners enjoying the biggest windfalls. households earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see an average income increase of 4.3 percent after taxes, while households earning between $50,000 and $75,000 would see their income increase by an average 1.6 percent after taxes. in all, the average household was expected to get a tax cut of $1,610, the tax policy center calculated.

[tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn't be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. trump's campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: mr. trump's plan would better help struggling families. current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. the deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. we provide credit to stay-at-home caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. to provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes—increasing their paycheck income each week.  – trump campaign the campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks. --tamara keith]

the findings raise a lot of questions about the right approach to managing pain, particularly chronic pain. so earlier this week, we asked listeners on facebook and twitter to share their questions about treating chronic pain.
partly because of the role models i had as a young critic almost 25 years ago, i've long taken pains to preserve a respectful distance between myself and the artists i covered. without falling for the myth of pure objectivity, i placed my faith in the idea of boundaries. when i joined facebook in 2008, i made the gut decision not to accept friend requests from musicians, later going so far as to explain my policy in jazztimes. one artist dinged me for inflated self-importance, a fair judgment. still, the alternative seemed so messy and compromised. as a workaday critic, my obligation was clear, at least to me. it wouldn't help anyone to pull my punches, or change my compass, on account of personal allegiance. fairness is the whole point. right? why would that ever change?
but trump used his twitter account to do more: routinely disparage, attack and threaten his rivals. researchers say trump's tweets supercharged falsehoods about racial justice protesters, the coronavirus and the election, among many other topics.

kelly: well, i think we can expect biden to move away from this maximum pressure campaign. i mean, we should note, it's put iran in a tough spot. the u.s. sanctions, the low oil prices, covid, a weak currency have all really hemmed in iran and a lot of ways. but biden has never been a fan of this, and he's going to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal if iran is willing. and i spoke about this with norm roule. he was a longtime cia official who was focused on the middle east and iran in particular.

and so his belief is that he can somehow try to subvert this ministry of propaganda, this vast war epic that is going to continue to kill vietnamese people in a cinematic fashion, which is simply the prelude to actually killing vietnamese people in real life. so he believes that he can try to make a difference. and, of course, the humor and the tragedy is that he can't.

that said, there's also the problem of educating everyone from law enforcement, prosecutors, about the value of this evidence. and going back even further a step, we do have this challenge of creating a system where victims feel comfortable coming forward and submitting themselves to these exams in the wake of what's likely the worst trauma of their lives. if i'm a survivor and i'm seeing headlines that say that my kit is going to sit and collect dust somewhere, where's my incentive to come forward? i think that's one of the things that we're seeing shift as more and more states step up to the plate and do what needs to be done to clear their backlogs.

martin: well, really, there were more caravans during the trump administration because people see that this is a safety in numbers for them, cheaper than paying a smuggler. many, of course, do see hope for better treatment of migrants under biden. but the timing, i think, has more to do with the devastations of the hurricanes that were in november. then came, you know, christmas. then it's a new year, and it's time to come up. and of course, this is due to, as father melo says, the desperation and the misery of so many hondurans.

fontenrose: the no. 1 thought that keeps me awake at night when i think about both the outgoing administration and the incoming administration in terms of the formulation of foreign policy is the piece of american exceptionalism on which much of our foreign policy has empirically been based. that doesn't work anymore, but our policies have not adapted to that, both in the trump administration and based on what we're hearing from the biden team thus far.

this southern city near the mississippi border seems like an unlikely place for such a concept. yet the area is surprisingly diverse: in 2016, there were more than 70,300 immigrants living in memphis — about 11 percent of the total population, according to a compilation of data from new american economy, a bipartisan research and advocacy firm focused on immigration policy. memphis is also home to one of 20 world relief offices in the u.s., which partner with churches and communities to provide transition programs for refugees and immigrants.

so i think it would be great if, at high schools and colleges across the country, instead of a big national dialogue on race, we started trying to teach something of the true history of race in this country. we need to talk about the fact that america was built on the free, forced labor of black people. you know, we are still struggling here in the south - in virginia, which was the second capital of the confederacy. we're still struggling over the actual history of the civil war. i think that would be a place to start.

sagal: here's your first question. there are, of course, a lot of specialty shoes. which of these might you really be able to slip onto your own feet? a, ski-walkers, shoes that sprout skis when you want to get down a snowy hill quickly, b, phone-holder shoes, which can hold your smartphone in the toes so you can just look at your feet and enjoy some youtube or c, no-place-like-home shoes, you click your heels together three times and a gps unit guides you home.
similarly, in the sanctuary city case, justice department lawyers argued that the executive order would affect only a few grants. but that is not how president trump or attorney general jeff sessions has talked about it. both have portrayed the cutoff of federal funds as a club to force these cities to aid federal authorities in carrying out trump administration immigration policies.

keith: yeah. let me just jump in to say that the single charge in this impeachment is incitement of insurrection. and what mcconnell said, what those words were, he is saying that the insurrection was provoked by the president. that is very close to saying that he is guilty of what he is charged with.
schneider divided data lords into two halves, the digital world and our natural world, with the latter meant to acknowledge the parts of human experience still unmediated by technology. one piece on that portion of the album bears the title braided together, after a phrase in a ted kooser poem — and that idea of interwovenness, of how we support each other, hits different now.
colbert: well, you know, people always said it was bill. but it's punditry in general, the sense of certainty regardless of the facts that was embodied in the idea of truthiness. that was the thesis statement for the entire show - that how you feel is more important than what the facts are and that the truth that you feel is correct is more important than anything that the facts could support, which is - which we expressed in a very concise way on the show. we embodied it satirically. though, it's not really a new idea. and as you can see, it's been amplified in interesting ways since we went off the air. but i didn't just want to play the game anymore.

allowing a lower-court ruling to stand, however, is not a foolproof strategy. that raises the possibility of having someone [else] intervene, said keith. for example, democratic attorneys general stepped in to defend the aca in a case now pending at the supreme court when the trump administration chose not to. so, you have to be pretty strategic about not appealing, she said.

we have been following secretary of state mike pompeo's tour of u.s. allies in the middle east this week. he is telling these allies that president trump's decision to withdraw u.s. troops from syria does not mean that the united states is giving up on this region. yesterday in a speech in cairo, pompeo blamed many of the region's problems, in particular the rise of isis, on a lack of leadership from former president barack obama.

their function is to literally just be stage props for an american drama. and my narrator understands this. and he understands it very intellectually and viscerally that what is happening here is that hollywood is the unofficial ministry of propaganda for the pentagon, that its role is to basically prepare americans to go fight wars by making them focus only on the american understanding of things and to understand others as alien and different and marginal, even to their own histories, right?

once upon a time, he said he would get rid of all of it in eight years. he walked that back, but his positions on how to handle that debt are still making headlines. just a few days ago, it seemed like trump wanted to renegotiate america's debt with the nation's creditors — a potentially disastrous policy. then it seemed like he was offering a subtler solution. then he said the u.s. government could print money to stave off default.

trump recently mused in an interview on sirius xm that had andrew jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the civil war. the president was returning to one the most studied eras of american history: the antebellum period, the decades leading up to the civil war. the causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. it is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. some desperately warned against disaster. yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.

they'd be free to vote their consciences. they would no longer have to abide by the results of their state's primaries, so both trump and cruz are trying to line up commitments from these delegates, who are living, breathing people with free will - at least after the first ballot. so it's really a shadow campaign.

house speaker nancy pelosi will be seated over president trump's left shoulder tuesday, less than two months after the democratic-controlled house impeached him — and just as the republican-controlled senate will be deciding whether to keep or remove him from office.

elving: but let's remember that there is, in a sense, a two-phase verdict in impeachment. it is possible that the senators could see the president as guilty of incitement but decide that, because he is no longer in office, it's not really an impeachable. and therefore, they don't have to vote for it. we heard that from some senators after the first impeachment. they said, we think he pretty much did everything he was accused of. but we don't think it rises to being an impeachable offense. now you have the question of, can you impeach someone who's no longer in office? and the operative question is, can you bar him from future office?

that's partly because the law is vague about which branch of government can give permission for someone to conduct foreign affairs, noted eugene volokh with the volokh conspiracy blog at the post in 2015. it could be the executive branch, it could be congress. it could even be the president telling just one member of congress to go do something without telling the others. it seems like [there] are so many loopholes and uncertainties, it's hard for prosecutors to peg down how someone violated this law — and even harder for courts to make that determination. but the law is pretty clear that you need to have permission from the government to do something, and it doesn't look like flynn had permission to talk to russians about sanctions while the obama administration was still in power.

vaughan: well, there are no great options here. because of the policies of the last few years, we've had more than 300,000 families and unaccompanied minors who've paid smugglers to bring them across. and most don't end up actually pursuing an asylum claim or any other claim that would allow them to stay. so the government needs to keep them in custody so that the immigration process can be completed. and their options are limited. they would rather keep families together in a family detention center. and that's what the policy was for a number of years until 2015, when a federal judge in california decided that kids could not be kept in custody and ordered the obama administration to release the kids. and that has meant often that the parents had to be released also. the trump administration has taken a different approach - in some cases, is holding the parents, and the kids are placed into hhs custody.
brennan: so i think it's pretty clear how it left me feeling. my brother kevin used to do a joke where he said like, yeah, i'm from a big family. i know how that ends. like, he didn't want to have kids. he now has two kids. but yeah, like, it doesn't - it's not - i don't know. i'm not curious. it wasn't - yeah, i don't know. i think it's - the same way alcohol affected me, i think i'm having a similar - i had a similar response to children, even though i was the youngest, so i can't say like, oh, it was awful. and it was fun in a lot of ways. but i never had, like, a little - i never got to see, like, a baby grow up or anything like that. it's never occurred to me to have children or to want children.

the lawsuit was filed by seven people who have been blocked from trump's account, along with the knight first amendment institute, which is affiliated with columbia university. the group initially threatened to sue a month ago, when it sent the white house a letter demanding that it stop blocking people who respond critically to the president's messages.
murphy: well, i think he'd be an excellent president. but i take him at his word today. and it reflects what i've heard from him, that he's not - this op-ed and what he's doing now has nothing to do with the 2020 race. it's more about being consistent to what he's already said. he'll support the president when, you know, they're aligned on policy. but when the president misbehaves, he's not afraid to criticize him.

liasson: yes. he's on tv every day. he's instituted white house briefings that had stopped. it's a lot less noisy to talk to the press inside than out on the south lawn in front of the helicopters. but, you know, the white house press corps has been clamoring for regular press briefings and now they have them. and the president has recognized the power of these briefings because people are holed up in their homes in front of the television, desperate for information about the virus. and most of the briefings have been about the virus.

but schiff declared, that way madness lies, if we are to accept the president essentially can do whatever he wants.
president trump says there's a humanitarian and national security crisis on the u.s.-mexico border. this idea of a border emergency can be traced back to the reports that began a few months ago of a caravan of central american migrants traveling up through mexico to the u.s. many of those migrants are now stuck in tijuana, mexico, just south of the border from san diego. and that's where npr's john burnett joins us from now. hi, john.
chadwick boseman is t'challa, king of wakanda, an unimaginably advanced, ruthlessly isolationist african nation that hides its riches and its tech from the world at large. wakanda, as vividly and gorgeously realized here, is a soaring afro-futurist utopia powered by the world's rarest, hardest and blue-glowiest metal, vibranium.

also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. the obama-clinton administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. as a result of recent obama epa actions coal-fired power plants across michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. the obama-clinton war on coal has cost michigan over 50,000 jobs.

many energy-producing states took a hit during the downturn, as companies went bankrupt, workers were laid off, and tax revenue collected from oil and gas dropped. in most of them, like north dakota, where preszler lives, wells produce both oil and gas. when prices plummeted, oil suddenly wasn't worth what it used to be, he says, but the gas still needed to be transported and treated, and that cost stayed constant.
murphy: i think they want us to take a stronger role in this relationship, and i want congress to take a stronger role. remember, we can say whatever we want in funding legislation. we could tie the president's hands and make it impossible for him to hold this money back. and, you know, i hope that we consider that. i hope that when we write the next funding bill for ukraine, we think about ways where we can guarantee that the money won't - you know, there won't be games being played with the money.

liasson: wisconsin is up next. that should be a good state for trump, although it's also full of anti-trump partisans like speaker ryan himself. we're also waiting to see if gov. scott walker, who dropped out of the race, endorses ted cruz. but the stop trump forces are busy planning for a contested convention in which delegates would be freed up after the first ballot if trump doesn't get 1,237 delegates.
it is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. his potential democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in gop primaries).
so gail atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. and for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.
i do think he should. and i think it's astounding that we are at a point in history now where the ethical bar has been so lowered that an attorney general nominee can come before the u.s. senate and say, i'm not willing to commit that i will follow the advice of ethics lawyers at the justice department. is this really where we are? shouldn't we expect at a minimum that any attorney general will agree to follow the advice of ethics lawyers? i think the problem here is he knows what that advice is going to be and that advice is going to be just the same as the advice to [acting attorney general] matt whitaker and for precisely the same reason: you have expressed publicly hostility to the mueller investigation. you will not have public confidence if you play a role in that investigation. you should recuse.
more concerning, levitt said, are proposals such as price's that could give workers who now rely on company health plans the option of instead using tax credits to buy individual coverage outside their company's plan. while offering workers more choice — a republican goal — it would also erode the aca's firewall that protects employer coverage from market turbulence.

nguyen: you know, it's a hierarchal feudal society. the vietnamese were already exploting each other. and then that was exacerbated by colonialism and american occupation - or intervention - however you want to describe it. and so it was ironic and not ironic that when they came to the united states, they would do the exact same thing to each other because in vietnam during the war years, you know, in order to survive in vietnam, you had to exploit each other.
nguyen: well, they were part of a great migration of about 800,000 north vietnamese catholics who had been persuaded by their parish priests that the communists were going to massacre them or at the very least persecute them. and that idea had been promulgated by the cia, by col. edward lansdale who became famous for helping the philippines suppress a communist insurgency in the 1950s and then he brought his talents to south vietnam. and he became the inspiration - so it was rumored - for alden pyle in graham greene's the quiet american. so that was the history behind why my parents had decided to flee. and they came from a region in north vietnam that was famous for producing hard-core revolutionaries like ho chi minh, who was born 30 minutes from their home village. and it was a region famous for producing hard-core catholics, and so my parents were among the hard-core catholics.

but even if republicans do regain control of one or both chambers, they still would have to contend with obama's potential veto of any major changes to the law, at least for two more years. and getting such changes to the president's desk might be just as problematic as passing the health bills in the first place.

the supreme court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. so if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.
myre: well, the u.s. eliminated a key iranian general. he's been blamed for the death of hundreds of americans over the past couple decades. the u.s. continues to impose sanctions as part of this maximum pressure campaign by president trump. but the killing really hasn't substantially altered the overall dynamics of the region. i mean, the u.s. and iran are still in this tense standoff. and we really have a perfect example here. just in recent days, an iraqi militia that's believed to be controlled by iran fired 21 rockets into the green zone in baghdad, where the u.s. embassy is based on december 20. and that's exactly the kind of activity that qassem soleimani was accused of orchestrating. and it's still taking place now a year after his death.

horowitz-ghazi: the organization and its partners have used lawsuits to successfully shut down coyote-hunting contests in several states. in 2014, california became the first state to ban them outright, followed by vermont last month. some hunters also oppose these competitions. they see them as unsporting and worry they give hunting a bad name. but let's just say the fact that fox is a vegetarian who lives in california and many of the competition hunters come from deep-red states is probably not a coincidence. there's a cultural divide here, and the way both sides describe each other can get heated.

these are silenced victims whose stories are never told by hillary clinton. but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. in short, the city of detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by hillary clinton.
meraji: that's why i got in touch with cynthia - because she's not only covered a bunch of these calls for racial dialogues over the years, she participated in one very high-profile attempt 20 years ago.
[this is clinton's strongest language yet about the trade deal she called a gold standard when she was secretary of state in the obama administration. at the time, the trade pact was in the early stages of negotiations. for the first several months of her campaign, clinton resisted taking a position on tpp, saying the deal was still being negotiated. she finally weighed in last october, a week before the first democratic debate, saying she couldn't support it in its current form. many progressives are suspicious that, like president obama did, she would soften her opposition to the trade deal if she is elected. donald trump has also charged that clinton fully intends to sign off on tpp if she is president. clinton has held firm in her opposition, but in an interview a close political ally of hers seemed to confirm the suspicions, saying she would likely implement it as president. the campaign moved immediately to tamp that down and clinton in this speech was unequivocal — perhaps because she had to be. -tamara keith]

as for the story, it is a truth universally acknowledged that wherever there is a palace, there must be palace intrigue: t'challa's claim to the throne is challenged by michael b. jordan's fabulously monikered killmonger, who manages to mong quite a few kills before facing off against his rival. like all of the best villains, killmonger's motivations are grounded in his zeal to correct a great injustice — one may quibble with his master plan's methodology (i.e, the wholesale slaughter of billions), but you gotta admit: dude has a point.

here to talk about some of the foreign policy implications is richard haass. he's head of the council on foreign relations. and his new book is, a world in disarray.
myre: yeah, she certainly has. she was an only child growing up in new york city. and when she graduated from high school, she spent a year at a judo academy in japan. and then she studied physics at the university of chicago. she loved to build things, including the avionics on a used cessna plane, which she planned to fly from maine to europe with her flying instructor. they had to make an emergency landing in canada. and a little bit later, she married her flight instructor. but she was in her early 30s by the time she graduated from georgetown law school and then began this quick rise in the government. one of her jobs was on the senate foreign relations committee, where she got to know the chairman, senator joe biden. she followed biden to the white house, worked on the national security council, was in the no. 2 at the cia. and now he's picked her to be the first woman to be director of national intelligence.
scribner: (as andre johnson) that does not sound as fun.
smith: yeah. i - well, i raised it with secretary mattis, but he's not there anymore, so - and we talked about this a couple times, as we were concerned about it. and i will say that the pentagon secretary, mattis, and everybody i spoke to was - you know, they were very adamant about not stepping across that line. the mixed messages were coming out of civilians in the white house, not out of the pentagon. they were very clear that they were not going to engage in law enforcement activity.
schake: no, it's not sour grapes. i've voted for a lot of republicans who i hadn't supported in primaries. i think donald trump is different and dangerous than other candidates. i think the kinds of comments he's made about america's allies and about america's role in the world make me cross the line for the first time.
students are never randomly assigned to a school. a school's population is always affected by local demographics. with schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.
the foreign ministries said that as a 'voluntary political decision,' north korea should declare a 'moratorium on testing nuclear devices and test launches of ballistic missiles.' in turn, the u.s. and south korea should 'accordingly refrain from large-scale joint maneuvers,' the joint statement added. they said 'the confronting parties' involved should sit down for talks to agree on principles that include a refusal to use force and a pledge to make the korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
it's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! we're all going to die, said mcelwee. every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things.

there have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity, peña nieto told excelsior, a daily newspaper in mexico city. that's how mussolini got in, that's how hitler got in — they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis. and i think what (they) put forward ended up at what we know today from history, in global conflagration. we don't want that happening anywhere in the world.

there's no question the optics are bad for clinton and the clinton foundation. but no proof has emerged that any official favors — regulations, government contracts, international deals — were curried in exchange for donations or pledges.
bill and hillary clinton have defended the foundation's work under the intensifying attacks. we're trying to do good things, bill clinton said wednesday. if there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, i don't know what it is. the people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing. i have nothing to say about it except that i'm really proud.

the ability for journalists to protect their sources, the ability for them to protect information they gather in the course of their reporting, the ability for them to be seen as independent of law enforcement and not just another intelligence arm of the government, is so central to what journalism is, said alexandra ellerbeck, the organization's north america program coordinator.
in a statement issued earlier this week, the law firm said it was concerned by mitchell's participation in the call between the president and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger and other state officials, which some legal experts have suggested may have violated state and federal law. during the call, trump urged the officials to find more than 11,000 ballots from the nov. 3 presidential election — enough to swing the state in his favor — and continued to push the debunked notion that the election results were fraudulent.

kenyon: acton says he's been pessimistic about the deal's future ever since president trump pulled the u.s. out of the agreement in 2018, saying iran needed to negotiate a much tougher and longer-lasting agreement. acton says after that, it was only a matter of time before iran stopped abiding by its commitments, as well. now, he says, the iranian attacks on u.s. military personnel at bases in iraq, and especially the killing of iranian general qassem soleimani, have pushed things even closer to the breaking point.

initially objecting to the sale were pes' unsecured creditors, including the united steelworkers union, which represented about 600 former refinery workers. they argued that the backup bidder, industrial realty group in partnership with former philadelphia energy solutions ceo phil rinaldi, offered $25 million more than hilco and an opportunity to restart refining operations and bring union workers back. but pes said hilco's bid still was deemed superior.

russakoff: well, that was again totally alienating of the community because there were a number of local foundations in newark that had been involved for years in education. and, you know, $5 million as an annual gift just was not in their budget. and so they were excluded from having any say, but more importantly, there was no way for the parents, the teachers, the principals, the community leaders - just, you know, really, really intelligence, smart, committed people who had been in the fray for years in the lives of children in education - to be part of this. and so basically, the board decided to spend the money the way the wealthy donors wanted it spent. and the priorities were not about getting money to the classroom or to the children. the priorities were to have to this kind of business model, top-down reform that had become very popular in the reform movement.

northam: david, pompeo criticized obama's nuclear deal with iran. he accused obama of blaming the u.s. for the problems of the middle east, instead of when, pompeo said, obama should have been providing strong american leadership. pompeo said - and i'm quoting here, david - the u.s. is a force for good in the middle east. but, you know, one of the main reasons for this trip was really to clear up confusion, you know, caused by conflicting statements from the trump administration about the u.s. withdrawing troops from syria.
we applaud president obama for taking these actions in response to the russian government-sponsored cyberattacks on the dnc, the clinton campaign, and our free and fair elections. however, more must be done. it has been widely reported that u.s. intelligence officials have a 'high level of confidence' that russian president vladimir putin was personally involved in these attacks, even providing direction on how the stolen material was leaked. these intrusions were not just 'hacks.' they were attacks on the united states by a foreign power and should be treated as such. therefore, today's action alone by the white house is insufficient. now it's time for president-elect trump and the republican leadership in congress to put our national security before politics and show the american people that they are serious about protecting our democracy. that's why i have called on congress to launch a thorough, independent, and bipartisan investigation on the russian government's unprecedented interference in the 2016 election.

there is a deep-seated law enforcement mentality of wanting everything in an investigation, irrespective of its relevance or whether the information duplicates data available somewhere else, said fred cate, vice president for research at indiana university and a senior fellow of its center for applied cybersecurity research. you can easily understand where this comes from, but in an increasingly digital world, it is unworkable.

ricks: it's against the american tradition to have a general running our military. it is seen as a threat to civilian control of the military. that said, i think donald trump is a far bigger threat to this country than james mattis ever would be. i think trump acts on impulse, on what pleases the crowd and on his gut feelings and doesn't know much about the big world out there. and that's a very dangerous combination to have as president. by contrast, jim mattis is a thoughtful, well-read, well-educated, disciplined, strategic thinker who knows a lot about the world and especially about the middle east where he spent several years fighting and serving as a military commander.

in december, the white house said it would pull all 2,000 troops from syria, a reversal of u.s. policy that reportedly was met with disapproval within the pentagon and prompted defense secretary jim mattis to resign in protest. troops began withdrawing in january, sparking criticism that the u.s. was leaving before it had completely eradicated the islamic state presence there.
the move is a stunning fall from grace for trump, who assembled a massive national following, in large part through the prolific use of his twitter feed. the platform was his preferred tool for announcing major changes in federal policy — and even changes in personnel. he occasionally fired cabinet secretaries and aides via tweet.

keith: foreign policy is something that we said would come up in this debate and, lo and behold, it did come up in this debate. one of our predictions was correct (laughter).
elving: scott, you're not hearing those charges from the health professionals around the president. they come when the president starts freelancing on twitter or in a briefing. and if there was something missing when trump came to power - that was, of course, over three years ago. what we do know is that there was an extensive plan, almost 70 pages, prepared by a special office within the national security council in the white house and turned over to the trump administration. in 2018, almost two years ago, that office was essentially disbanded, and that plan was essentially discarded. so those are the facts. those are the things that we do know.

goldberg: because he told me that this was a hinge moment of his presidency. he suggested this very strongly to me, that this was the moment that he, quote, broke with the washington playbook, end quote. and i asked him what he meant by the washington playbook, and he says, you know, there's literally a playbook on the shelf in the foreign policy establishment in the pentagon, in the state department that says if country x does this, then the united states does y. and he believes that the playbook is over-militarized, that - and it's kind of a cruise missile playbook. if these people do this, then i'm going to fire this missile at them. he believes that the playbook also holds that the u.s. is responsible for management of the middle east. and that's another core aspect of the obama doctrine, is to question that underlying assumption that we've made for three decades or more that this is our main responsibility in the world - is to keep this under management. and so at that moment in 2013, a lot of different things are welling up inside of him. there's practical political considerations obviously, but there's also these broader themes, which is like, i don't want to be the manager of the middle east. and so this is what he's thinking in that moment. and when he made that decision, he thought, i've finally broken with the washington playbook.
mcmullin: you're exactly right. that is the primary motivation for the kim regime in pursuit of nuclear weapons - is to preserve its power. and so the goal then, if - the goal has to be to change the way they think about the best way to do that. right now they think the best way to do that is to develop nuclear weapons. it's understandable that they would think that, by the way. it's a rational conclusion, but we have to change that dynamic. and the only way we can really do that is with a lot more help from china. and so that's got to be the approach. china provides most of north korea's energy and other support - humanitarian, et cetera. and we've got to change the dynamic there so that the regime actually fears, you know, its demise through lack of that support rather than through its lack of nuclear weapons.
the study finds that child marriage can also damage a country's overall economy because of the devastating impact that under-age marriage has on a girl's educational prospects, which, in turn determine her earning power. there's a bit of chicken-and-egg conundrum when it comes to quantifying the connection between child marriage and high school dropout rates, notes petroni. that's because in places where child marriage is common, it's also often the case that girls don't have easy access to schools. so it can be hard to determine whether a girl drops out because she's been married off, or whether she's married off because she's no longer attending school.

burnett: it's huge if they follow through with it. a month ago, i was in el paso, and i met some immigrant families at a shelter there. they'd fled guatemala and honduras with their small kids in tow. they did what's called a credible fear interview. they asked for asylum. if they pass the interview, they had electronic ankle monitors strapped on, and then most of them hopped on a greyhound and went to their cities of destination to await their day in immigration court. the immigrant families actually know if they travel with kids, they'll likely be released while their immigration courses go through the system. so this new policy of separation is supposed to be a harsh deterrent.

kodjak: i mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and sanders says his - making medicare-for-all will cost less. but the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a social security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. and then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions.

(the irony of mcmaster picking up obama's strategy is that it embraces at least three of what mcmaster has called the pentagon's four latter-day fallacies of war: an overreliance on precision airstrikes supported by high-tech surveillance; an overemphasis on special operations forces; and a preference for the use of indigenous troops over americans.)

we are living in historic times. the great pandemic of 2020 has crippled the global economy, shut down life as we knew it and overwhelmed what was always touted as a sophisticated and modern health care system in the united states. the federal government under the trump administration delayed the rollout of testing due to mismanagement and mistakes. so now it's falling to local governments around the country to test people for the coronavirus and to get enough protective equipment, or ppes, to hospitals - that means mayors and council members, people who may have never experienced anything like this crisis.

tucker: (laughter) well, i remember thinking to myself that this probably isn't going to go anywhere. with all due respect to president clinton, i thought that he gave the answers that were most politically safe. you know, again, i'm not sure a national conversation about race would move us along. i would much prefer if we could attempt to have some history lessons. i think that this is a country that has failed to grapple with its ugly and violent racial history. i think that one of the things that got northam in trouble is that he has no sense of the history of blackface in this country.

jones writes about the capitol's segregation in his forthcoming book, the last plantation: racism in the halls of congress, which will be published later this year by princeton university press. i talked to him about the book's provocative title, the people who work behind-the-scenes, and some of the things congress could do to balance out its racial inequities. our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
you should think of medicaid expansion as no different than if you said, 'oh, hey, somebody's going to go open up a factory, says bryce ward, an economist at the university of montana, in missoula. and that factory is going to bring, in the case of montana, $600 million of outside money into the state that we're going to pay to workers here.
the north carolina chapter of the american civil liberties union is calling mccrory's order a poor effort to save face, with acting executive director sarah preston saying that the governor's actions fall far short of correcting the damage done by the measure. she added that legal protections are still lacking and that transgender people are still explicitly targeted by being forced to use the wrong restroom.

[according to a recent new york times article, 23 countries are considered largely uncooperative in taking back their citizens. the u.s. has released 8,000 immigrants with criminal convictions (both with legal status and those who are in the country illegally) since 2013. the issue, the times explained, is that some countries won't take these people back, but the supreme court has also ruled that the u.s. can't detain these people indefinitely. — danielle kurtzleben]

you might think you're home free in that case, but not yet. remember that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are not 100% effective, and many in the research community still advise caution. once most people are protected and there's less virus circulating in the air — and less circulating in the community — the advice and restrictions on this may ease up a bit. one vision of the new normal, whether that's later in 2021 or even 2022, is an eventual relaxation of the recommendations, with occasional renewals when the virus flares up in a community.
cruz issued his own debate challenge to his main iowa rival — a 90-minute one-on-one debate next monday, the day of the iowa caucuses.
in that sense, this year's race is looking more like 2012 than 2008. in 2012, iowa evangelicals' support was relatively divided. entrance polls showed santorum with 32 percent of evangelicals' support, compared with ron paul's 18 percent (remarkably close to the cruz-trump split that this latest poll shows). three other candidates each took 14 percent. santorum went on to win the caucuses by just 34 votes over mitt romney. paul finished a strong third.

this is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. and the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program. it was a certainty. it might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. this administration has pulled the band-aid off. it's been realistic. we accept the facts on the ground as they are.

the administration seems to be in a grey area, legally, said matt lee-ashley, who served as deputy chief of staff at interior under the obama administration and is now with the left-leaning center for american progress. at least in the past administration, the lawyers in the department of interior were crystal-clear that civil servants weren't to be doing activities where there was no clear appropriation from congress, and made clear there were criminal penalties associated with that.

here's why: before approving the moderna and pfizer vaccines, the fda asked the vaccine manufacturers only whether their products protect people from covid-19 symptoms. they didn't ask if the vaccines stop people who've been vaccinated from nevertheless spreading the virus to others. the emergency authorizations by the fda that have allowed distribution of the two new vaccines cite only their ability to keep you — the person vaccinated — from becoming severely sick with covid-19.

he initiated investigations over the bias claims, reaching into voice of america's newsroom in ways a federal judge said broke the law and the first amendment. pack hired a richmond, va., law firm to investigate top u.s. agency for global media executives after already seeking to oust them; new allegations, backed by correspondence reviewed by npr, suggest he paid more than $2 million to that firm to conduct such reviews. (the lead partner on the investigation, john d. adams, was a law clerk to u.s. supreme court justice clarence thomas, the subject of a sympathetic 2020 documentary by pack.) pack even fired white house aides assigned to help him by the trump administration, suspecting them of disloyalty.

kenyon: other nonproliferation experts are taking a slightly more optimistic view. laura rockwood, longtime nuclear safeguards official with the iaea, the international atomic energy agency, now directs the group open nuclear network in vienna. she says, rhetoric aside, what iran has actually done to date doesn't add up to a sprint to acquire nuclear weapons.
albright and heinonen suggest that iran may be in violation of some of these restrictions, and they argue that the iaea should inspect iranian military sites as a regular part of enforcing this part of the agreement, not treat such inspections as special cases used only in response to evidence of a specific violation.

inskeep: well, tell me about something else that i think is in peoples' heads and that is part of the argument here. there's a sense that jobs may well be created. but jobs are also destroyed. people are thrown out of work. and the people who are really profiting are investors or stockholders. it may be good for the broader economy to do a trade deal. but it's really people at the top who are benefiting. is that statistically true?

brooks: yeah, and i would say that on both sides there's a debate about systemic thinking. barack obama came in promising to change the system and clearly did not, as he himself admits. how do you change the system? bernie sanders and donald trump promise some sort of abstract systemic change. i happen to think there's a lot of magical thinking there. clinton is more - i'll be a fighter within the system. so it's, how do you change the basic structures of power?

tehran will try to prevent biden from taking advantage of this leverage by creating an atmosphere of imminence and crisis. even as tehran reacted to the siege at the u.s. capitol this week, president rouhani repeated his call on biden to lift sanctions, saying, if you won't fulfill your commitments, we won't bow to you. tehran's efforts can be divided into three categories.
for one thing, those data points can be used to target advertising, o'connor says. and she worries the government or private companies could use the information to deny services, like health insurance — or even water.

detrow: that's right. that's right. and i think biden and harris have been very careful, especially in the past few weeks as impeachment has started up again, to try to move on from president trump. they have really resisted weighing in on everything that has happened. their statements on the impeachment boil down to a simple statement. the house did impeach president trump today. they do not want this - of course, they're not going to have a choice. the senate's going to hold a trial. and that's going to slow down their early legislative agenda over the next few weeks. but i think, especially when we hear from biden later today, he is going to try very hard to turn a page even if there will be all sorts of implicit rebukes of president trump and what he has represented for this country in that inaugural address, in those messages of coming together.
even if iran does escalate its nuclear program or its provocative regional activity, biden has tools to deflect the pressure. he plans to strengthen relations with key u.s. allies, including france, germany and the united kingdom, which are party to the nuclear agreement. under trump, european states spent as much time condemning washington as they did tehran. with unity between the u.s. and europe, new iranian provocations will only further isolate tehran. the three european states on wednesday issued a sharp condemnation of iran's latest nuclear steps, a sign of future u.s.-european unity. russia and china, the other signatories to the agreement, will also oppose iranian efforts to significantly expand its nuclear program. israel will remain laser-focused on iran and probably will set clear red lines to box in iranian activity.

since raphael warnock and jon ossoff, the newly elected democrats from georgia, have not been sworn in yet, republicans currently have the majority in the senate, and gop chairs will preside over the five confirmation hearings on tuesday. warnock and ossoff's elections were certified on tuesday by the georgia secretary of state. they could be sworn in as early as wednesday to officially begin their senate work. in addition, alex padilla, appointed by california gov. gavin newsom to take the seat of vice president-elect kamala harris, is expected to sworn in as early as wednesday. but the organization of the 50-50 senate could take some time to sort out. harris will serve as the tiebreaking vote since the vice president also serves as president of the senate.

horsley: people including the president himself. we've seen a real sort of jekyll-and-hyde display from the white house this week. after that tragic shooting at the congressional baseball practice on wednesday the president went on television, made a somber, i think, well-received address where he called for unity, said all the - for all of our partisan squabbles we're stronger when we act together.
in recent years, members of congress from both parties have supported expanding eligibility for health savings accounts and also expanding the list of ways that money can be spent. to date, though, those proposals, as well as other changes regarding the accounts, haven't become law.

ricks: they do know a lot, but i think it's important to make a distinction here that trump is not just randomly picking generals. he's picking a particular subclass of generals, which is those who got in hot water with the obama administration. mattis, petraeus and flynn all were ousted from their positions by the administration for various reasons.
on twitter, president trump responds to reports he's under fbi investigation for possible obstruction of justice. while some say his tweets confirm a probe, he could be reacting to press accounts.

diatom ribbons, the album, took no. 1 in the 2019 npr music jazz critics poll. those results were still a couple of days out at the time of the show, last jan. 12. but there was electricity in the air regardless — even by the heightened standards of winter jazzfest, an industry summit and musical choose-your-own-adventure that i've come to regard as the most frenetically sociable time of the year. i remember walking into the neon grotto of the sultan room and encountering a dozen different colleagues i'd missed while dashing in and out of a week's worth of shows and panels.
it matters who's in the room when policy decisions are being made because those decisions will affect everyone. staffers are instrumental in helping lawmakers think through complicated issues, issues that will confront communities of color. so whether you're talking about policing or climate change or even economic policy, it matters who's in the room and it matters what perspectives are being heard and listened to as policy is being made.

nations like south korea have what acemoglu and robinson call inclusive institutions, such as representative legislatures, good public schools, open markets and strong patent systems. inclusive institutions educate their populations. they invest in infrastructure. they fight poverty and disease. they encourage innovation. they are far different from the extractive institutions found in countries like north korea, venezuela and saudi arabia, where small groups of elites use state power for their own ends and prosper through corruption, rent-seeking or brutally forcing people to work.

this week, new jersey took an unprecedented step. it started releasing all individuals in the state's county jails who've been convicted of low-level crimes or are serving time for probation violations. others who are still awaiting trial will not be released. aclu-nj attorney alexander shalom says the aclu, public defenders, prosecutors and the state attorney general's office negotiated an agreement because there is an urgent need to reduce the jail population to help contain any spread of the coronavirus. he says it will mean freedom for about 1,000 individuals.

he's a good example of when the royalty process works. it goes like this: gas companies and landowners sign a lease agreement before drilling begins. the royalty is money paid to the mineral owner, like clark, for the right to use his resource. it's negotiated to be a certain percentage of the revenue from the sale of the gas.

egyptians have been doing much more than they had been, whether it's rotating senior officials in and out of the area to reduce the opportunity for bribery, shutting down a lot more tunnels, trying to do things farther into sinai, he says. but this is something that is in the egyptian national interest. and i think they see it that way.

the withdrawal from the trans-pacific partnership means that the united states is now involved in none of the major economic negotiations in asia, he said. trump and his leadership skipped most of the diplomacy in southeast asia, and that's where china is starting to expand its influence. ... and trump put a lot of tariffs and pressure on u.s. allies that really rattled them.

smith: i think this is part of the debate and part of what went into the border deployment - was the concern that the president - there was mixed messages coming out of the white house that wanted to use them for law enforcement in the u.s., which is a clear violation of our constitution and a precedent that we do not want to set. so yes; part of this discussion about the border deployment is going to be to emphasize the clear constitutional law that u.s. military does not do domestic criminal situations. they are not allowed to act as a law enforcement agency.

for months, the democratic side of the presidential debate had been considered to conduct quieter, more restrained presidential debates. but the tables seemed to have turned this week. democrats were at their fieriest yet, and the republican contenders are coming off a week of family filled town halls and a recent debate that seemed to focus a lot on policy instead of hand size and insulting nicknames.

graves: it's a new form of preemption basically - that's right. if a city does adopt such a measure, it would be denied revenue. and certainly a city could go ahead and adopt such a measure and then try to litigate it, but in the meantime, it's a very difficult environment if the state actually goes through with that threat and does not give funding for police and firefighters. it's an extraordinary hammer to impose on, in essence, the idea of offering paid sick, of having a city require paid sick leave within its jurisdiction.

congress technically has legislative options to counter trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. and any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.

[earlier in the speech, trump used labor department measures of unemployment for detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. his son, donald jr., has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. politifact gave that claim a pants on fire rating. — danielle kurtzleben] [aside from that, it's true that the current unemployment figure — 4.9 percent — is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. in fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the labor department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. however, that doesn't make the headline unemployment rate a hoax. as for the 1 in 5 figure, trump is working off of a bls report that found that 19.7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. that's different from in the labor force, and it's also an incomplete measure — the labor department's definition of family would include retired couples, for example. — danielle kurtzleben]

after the meeting, sophomore blaire thomas launches the website on her phone, checks out the sentence starters and decides to write about the off-campus exclusion.
each federal department and agency which is empowered to extend federal financial assistance to any program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section 601 with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken. no such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and until approved by the president.
sharp: well, their child should absolutely be protected against bullying, harassment or anything else. and we've seen schools across the country do a great job of protecting every student under their care. but part of that duty of protection is also protecting the right of privacy. and so we're hearing from lots of students across the country and parents saying this violates our right to privacy when we're forced to share locker rooms, showers and restrooms with someone of the opposite sex. and so that's actually what motivated, i think, over 130 parents and students in chicago to actually sue the federal government because they came in and forced the school to open up their restrooms and locker rooms to the opposite sex.
experts say that improved education and higher incomes in china have led to delayed marriage and childbirth and that once-strict government restrictions on births have made one-child households the norm.

higgins: i was so concerned about what platform he was going to move to because he got blocked from all of them except for pinterest. and i was like, oh, no. pinterest is so cute, and now he's just going to be, like, quilting confederate flags together.
kelemen: in an interview with npr, tillerson said his mission is to stay focused on security and economic interests. the list of goals was longer in previous administrations. president obama, for instance, had diplomats and development experts put a big focus on climate change, while the bush administration talked a lot about democracy promotion. michele kelemen, npr news, washington.
anyone waiting for a particular trump policy to be wiped from the books will likely have to pack their patience. but law professor bagley said he's optimistic it will all get done.
one of those people was hillary vance, of the university of arizona.
until those racial disparities are fixed, said catherine crump, director of the samuelson law, technology & public policy clinic at the university of california, berkeley's school of law, this is not a technology that should be deployed on a widespread basis.
president trump went to texas on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to show off one of his signature election promises — the border wall — as democratic lawmakers appear ready to move forward with impeaching him for a second time.
on wednesday, the melee on the capitol drew calls from democratic lawmakers and civil rights advocates for trump to be kicked off twitter and facebook over a long pattern of abusing the platforms.
h.j.res. 99: making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, and for other purposes.
(soundbite of panic! at the disco song, high hopes)
haass: it's not just isolationist, america first - it sends the signal that the united states is going to narrow and calculate its self-interest. and we're simply not going to care about what it might mean for other people or other countries. so here, we're seeing the humanitarian crisis, but we're also going to see other countries taking matters into their own hands.
when these wells go in, i have friends that have restaurants and bars in the area, they're packed.
garcia-navarro: just quickly, i want to get your response to what we've seen happen at airports overnight - people crammed for up to seven hours waiting to get through customs and immigration because of screenings. how does that look from a disaster preparedness point of view?
all those programs require a whole lot of money. the foundation has raised more than $2 billion since 2001, according to the washington post.

stein: yeah. so as you said, the critics say the big problem right now is not not having enough vaccine; the big problem is getting the vaccine that's out there actually into people's arms. so that should be the focus. but there are also big worries about, as you mentioned, not having enough vaccine to make sure everyone gets that second shot. you know, no one knows how helpful the protection from one shot will really be. you know, how long will it last? how strong will it be? and a spokesman for operation warp speed released a statement today that was really sharply critical of biden's plans if it threatens that booster.
now that egypt has tightened security, abu talib says many smugglers are out of the business and many tunnels were shut down.
npr correspondents susan davis, sarah mccammon, scott neuman and kelsey snell contributed to this report.
sagal: laurel - i mean, pretty clear, right? but if you isolate the high end, it sounds like this.
siegel: i think, months ago, we all expected that, on the eve of the iowa caucuses, we'd be talking about hillary clinton. i don't think we expected we'd be talking about bernie sanders. so the question is, what do we make of this phenomenon? david, what do you make of sanders?
you also photographed people grieving in arlington cemetery.
three months later, trump told the associated press, the dreamers should rest easy. the term dreamers is often used to refer to daca participants.
on immigration, biden goes big in opening bid to congress
so, here it is: a tour of grand staircase-escalante. that is, a tour of the national monument's economic impact, the political cloud surrounding it — and what we can expect once zinke's decision comes down.
and they have served, he says. they have a record. they have won elections in those districts.
the government accountability office finished a yearlong investigation of the fda's orphan drug program in 2018. it found that the agency wasn't always ensuring that the intent of the orphan drug act was being met. instead, fda reviews that determined orphan designation were often inconsistent and incomplete.
lee: yes. you know, my anger was not about the soleimani killing. it was, instead, about the possibility of future military action against iran. and it was on that topic that they refused to make any commitment about when, whether and under what circumstances it would be necessary for the president, or the executive branch of government, to come to congress seeking authorization for the use of military force.
tommy wrote at length about philosophy and animal rights; he thought about how human lives should be measured against those of animals and animal suffering. he wrote poetry. speaking at dc vegfest in 2017, he recited his lengthy poem where war begins. an excerpt:
like people who live outside the correction facilities, inmates can be subject to involuntary drug treatment, officials say, but only if a court deems that step appropriate.

as he said, trump has signed a record number of resolutions reversing obama-era regulations, 15 in total. these resolutions were passed under the congressional review act and only required a simple majority for passage in the senate. it was only used once before, by george w. bush.
separate from the bill, biden also plans to sign executive actions on wednesday to reverse trump's travel ban on a group of primarily muslim nations, repeal trump's hardline immigration enforcement orders, stop construction of his wall on the southern border with mexico, among other measures.
several days after the tour, a group of attorneys agrees to sit down and describe their interviews with two dozen of the migrant children. they have been granted access to these shelters by a federal judge to oversee the welfare of unaccompanied kids in federal custody.
the reality is, you can have masking and distancing rules, but whether or not people follow them and whether they're easily enforceable is a very different thing, says dr. henry wu, director of emory travelwell center and an associate professor of infectious diseases at emory university school of medicine. the aircraft environment itself can be a contentious, high-stress situation; crews have always had a tough time dealing with passengers who don't want to follow their policies.
for example, analysts have suggested that the gop replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass byrd rule scrutiny either. that's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.
natapoff: and misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. they fund courts. they fund probation offices. they fund public defender offices. they fund prosecutor offices. some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. it's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. it's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.
gross: you describe depression as being like a virus that attacks your brain with negative thoughts. and you also say, like, to say i had low self-esteem isn't true. i had no self-esteem. so it must be hard to decide to get onstage when you feel like you have no self-esteem.
the second thing i'd ask is to make sure that the way in which they're going about hiring and promotion is fair. often it's through social networks, and it's these social networks that in many ways facilitate the hiring of white staffers; it's just, you know, this insider's game. so in many ways, we need to push back and have much more transparent and fair hiring and promotion processes, and make sure that people from different backgrounds are able to work in government.
5) the gcf has what one green researcher calls a special sauce that similar organizations lack.
rose: soszynski says that's not the case anymore.
pg&e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years, the california public utilities commission said in a statement.
but passengers who test negative before their flight may turn out to have the disease once they get to their destination, because it usually takes a few days after infection for tests to catch the virus.
this appearance offered a different side of trump that iowa hasn't seen much. he stuck to the teleprompter as he talked about issues specific to iowa.
now, i don't think the president has fully moved on, in part because, you know, we still don't have an ambassador. we don't have a new special envoy. the meeting in the white house still has not happened. but congress, at least, can make sure that money continues to flow and that we still, you know, have high-level delegations showing support for ukraine and the new president, who's doing a fantastic job. and while the relationship is not back on sound footing, i think it's important for us to get beyond impeachment and show to the ukrainian people that the american people are still with them.
trump said friday that he expects such legal challenges and predicted they would eventually reach the supreme court, where, he said, we'll win, i think.
vatican sex crimes investigator on summit
in that moment, my instinct was to say something snarky (did he realize you were a doofus when he became your friend?). but like chung, i didn't want to ruin a good time. so i laughed, poured myself a drink, and let everyone move on.
to protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. we must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. the best. we must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that hillary clinton pushed in iraq, in libya, in egypt and in syria. instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying isis and stamping out islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. we're going to win. we're going to win fast.
kelly: now, he did not rule out that another republican might be tempted to run against president trump. so let me ask you, what is the precedent for that in recent history for challenging a sitting president in the primary?
we will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. there will be no amnesty.
babbitt's social media profiles indicate that she had most recently worked at a pool service company in southern california. the military confirmed to npr that she was also a veteran of the united states air force, where she most recently achieved the rank of senior airman. babbitt entered active duty with the military in 2004, serving until 2008. after that, she served with the air force reserve from 2008 to 2010, and the air national guard from 2010 to 2016. during her service, she received the iraq campaign medal, indicating she served there in support of the u.s. war.
pushing away those who are supremely loyal to trump would seem to be out of the question, since they represent such a big chunk of the party's base. but reed thinks the party can address their concerns and convince them that in a democracy, it's possible for the republican party to lose a legitimate election.
bruce springsteen: (singing) we take care of our own.
this would be the first of many weeks.
she pointed to trump's close ties to russian president vladimir putin, his anti-democratic rhetoric, and his threats to the freedom of the press.
that, at least, is what politicians from both countries have been carefully asserting since michael howard, a former british conservative party leader, made a not-so-subtle suggestion sunday that force would be on the table in some recent unpleasantness over the long-disputed peninsula.
and so the congressional black caucus was extended an invitation for all 49 of our members to go to the white house. we chose to just send the leadership. we took the time to write a 125-page document that basically said, this is what we have to lose. each of us made a presentation on a substantive area of policy. mine was criminal justice. and basically, he wasn't really able to have a dialogue. we do think he paid attention. i just don't think that there was any there there to actually have a dialogue with us. and then he also made it clear just a few days ago what he thinks about the congressional black caucus. when the democratic senators mentioned that the cbc would be upset at the immigration proposal, he basically said he had no interest in what the congressional black caucus said.
sen. richard blumenthal, d-conn., said the position brought dershowitz into the land of legal absurdity, he tweeted. that anything a public official does for re-election is ok. that cannot be true.
taxing medical benefits could spur employers to erode or drop those benefits and make workers less likely to accept them, said larry levitt, a senior vice president with the kaiser family foundation. (kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
martin: so to begin with, let's talk about how to talk about this. i mean, there have been a lot of terms used to describe what happened wednesday. some are calling it a protest. others are calling it an insurrection. some are calling it domestic terrorism. given your expertise, how do you characterize what happened wednesday and why?
over the years, he intentionally ran up huge amounts of debt on his companies and then he defaulted, clinton said tuesday. hundreds of people lost their jobs. shareholders were wiped out. contractors — many of them small businesses — took heavy losses. many went bust. but donald trump? he came out fine.
i've mused aloud before about the grief shouldered by the jazz community last year, especially during that ghastly stretch in the spring. at the end of 2020, jazz night in america paid tribute with an in memoriam radio episode, and commissioned trumpeter keyon harrold to perform an elegy. so there's no reason to restate the scope of our losses here — except maybe to point out that the artists we mourned were part of a larger musical ecology that also vanished, at least for the foreseeable future. what will that ecosystem resemble when clubs can feasibly reopen, and festivals start booking again, and artists can go back out on tour? i wonder whether this global reset can foster a more sustainable, more equitable, more accessible future for the music. there'll be so much ground to regain, so much rebuilding to do. but based on an array of conversations with musicians, arts presenters and my fellow writers over the last several months, i sense an opening.
the president's warning followed tough talk over the weekend by other administration leaders.
in an interview with npr's morning edition, berkowitz said she guesses osha should have done 10,000 to 20,000 safety inspections since march and instead has done only a few hundred. osha has been awol, she said.
stephen legomsky, who served as chief counsel at u.s. citizenship and immigration services during the obama administration, says prosecution in such instances would be a new step for the u.s. government.
kodjak: kids at the public pool where he took swimming lessons hurled racial epithets his way. and when he got to high school...
torre: well, to quote another line from the matrix - that, mr. minkoff, is the sound of inevitability. this is...
kelly: ok. and when you hear him say he's in no rush, what should we read into that?
so, for example, in the fight over increase the minimum wage, even though these state chambers are supposed to represent those businesses - this was a survey of their own members, and their target members - these state chamber executives were told here's how to fight back. here's how to combat these popular measures to increase the minimum wage. and they were told, for example, in that area to pivot to the earned income tax credit to try to talk about something else rather than the minimum wage. and it was interesting to see.
i will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.
she gave out a feeling of loneliness, said the friend, who has a wife and son several provinces away, near shanghai. she was clearly unhappy.

rose: here's ken cuccinelli last year when he was the acting head of u.s. citizenship and immigration services talking about the need to crack down on fraud and abuse.
being the woman with a plan quickly became warren's identity on the campaign trail. it also became a liability when she started weathering attacks, first for not having a way to pay for sanders' medicare for all proposal, which she supports, and then over her eventual proposal to pay for that plan. (sanders, for his part, has not yet released a detailed plan for how he would pay for medicare for all if he's elected.)
banks: my mom - when the transcriptions came back from the nuremberg trials, she was at the treasury. and that's where the secret service used to be. and there was a tunnel that used to go under - and maybe it's probably still there - from the treasury department to the white house. so, yeah, there's a lot of stuff. and as far as sexual harassment goes, she always left her office door wide open. and she raised me by herself.
these problems were the subject of a series of npr stories about how people with disabilities were denied ventilators and other pandemic care in oregon. npr's stories were cited in ocr's proposal.
brennan: you know it. and they'd all have some heroic story of escape, too, like - so finally my uncle fabrizio was like [expletive]. he punched the slave master, and he walked from north carolina straight to jersey. all right.
allies are pretty darn important, right? he said at the csis event last may. especially at these far reaches of american power. especially when hoping to deter these revisionist powers. and so really what we want to do is prevent conflict, and our allies are essential to doing that.

ultimately, we're going to be left holding the bag, says michael wara of stanford university. if pg&e can't pay all of these costs, then it's the california taxpayer that ultimately will.
the $900 billion coronavirus aid package out of congress includes funding for low-income households that need help getting water. this is a big issue in detroit, where officials recently committed to ending the city's water shutoffs, at least until 2022. from member station wdet, eli newman reports on how the pandemic brought a change in policy.
gross: (laughter) were you a tough guy at all as a young man?
except that's not quite the full story. the ap ignored the thousands of meetings that clinton held with government officials from the united states and other countries. such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties, the news organization argued.

mcconnell also said confidently last week that all the members of the gop conference backed his approach to have the prosecution and defense lay out their arguments and address written questions before turning to the issue of whether to subpoena witnesses or documents.
burns: i think his record of achievement is very thin in foreign policy. but you're right, michel. certainly encouraging arab countries to recognize the state of israel is positive. illuminating the problem of china lying and cheating on its trade practices, trade commitments around the world is something, i think, that most republicans and democrats will agree with. trying to achieve an agreement with kim jong un was right in the beginning, but he - ultimately, president trump didn't accomplish much. you have to give some credit for those. but on the whole, he's done enormous damage.
already, the post-mortems are almost writing themselves. and there are a number of theories as to why jeb! failed in this campaign, especially after being the early favorite with all the conventional advantages. all of these theories, of course, acknowledge the effect of donald trump, the surprising success of his campaign and the damage his relentless attacks on bush inflicted. but there are other reasons, as well.
the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.

this is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the democratic party rather than at the fringes. sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton. sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.
block: so you'd go and do - you'd do research across the street.

gross: well, dale russakoff, thank you so much for talking with us.
martin: right. so what went wrong? i mean, how did he miscalculate?
yadlin: it depends. the deal is not the issue. the issue is how will we stop the iranian nuclear ambitions, how we stop the iranian subversion and the attempt to have hegemony in the middle east. and you haven't mentioned the last week israeli-iranian confrontation over syria, how we change the regime behavior and the regime determination to destroy israel and how we do all of these very important objectives without going to war. so it's too early to judge. it depends on the iranian reaction to president trump move and depends on how israel and the u.s. will react to the iranian reaction.
fox news shot back in a statement late tuesday evening, saying it was the trump campaign who had threatened kelly.

turning an eye toward the general election and likely rival hillary clinton, he went hard after the democrat for playing the woman's card. it was a new line of attacks that likely worry many party strategists as they seek to woo the important female voting bloc in november, among whom trump has high unfavorables in general election polling.
facebook deleted the same video twitter acted on and blocked trump's account from sharing messages for 24 hours, but the social network did not say it was considering a permanent suspension of trump.
irwin: well, it's very interesting. both parties have this division within them. interestingly, public opinion polls suggest that democrats support trade more than republicans. but the democratic candidates are speaking more to their union base in the party and opposing these trade agreements. meanwhile, the republicans traditionally have been, in recent decades, much more in favor of free trade. but the republican base does not support trade as much. and now you see some candidates moving in that direction as well.

as kelly told me, i was at the state department on friday to interview mike pompeo, and unless i agree any portion of our conversation is off the record, it's not. some journalists will agree to go off the record just to hear what the official has to say. many others like kelly will not, because they do not want their hands to be tied if they learn something truly important that they then cannot report.

the incident on a flight from chicago to louisville triggered a firestorm of outrage against united, fueled by videos of the confrontation and what was seen as a tone-deaf response from the airline, whose initial explanations ignored the violence on one of its planes and stated simply that one customer had refused to leave. soon after, united's ceo munoz stated, i apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers.
on the train, the bathrooms are spacious, large enough to fit a wheelchair. and ballard can stay in his wheelchair, instead of checking it like luggage — and then worrying that this expensive piece of equipment that is hard to fix and crucial to his mobility — will be damaged.
the reason there's not such a crime is that there's concern, and it's legitimate, that such a statute could be used to squelch free expression, nojeim said.
maduro blames the country's growing crisis on foreign economic sanctions, claiming that the u.s. is leading an effort to wipe out socialism in venezuela, according to reuters. presidential elections are set to be held by april 30, which is much earlier than usual, but venezuela's pro-government supreme court last week banned the main opposition party from running.

banks: (as mike ehrmantraut) once you call it in, the people who show up will be with the office of medical investigations. that's primarily who you'll talk to. police officers may arrive, they may not - depends on how busy a morning they're having. typically, ods are not a high-priority call. there's nothing here to incriminate you, so i'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. however, if you do, you say nothing. you tell them you just want your lawyer, and you call saul goodman. do i need to state the obvious? i was not here.
jurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. and so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. and for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.

this statistic from a 2014 bloomberg study came as a huge surprise to joanna james, a journalist-turned-filmmaker who is also the daughter of a female restaurateur. when she decided to make her first documentary feature film about her mother's journey as a chef, restaurant owner and single mother, she had no idea that her mother's struggles to establish herself in the restaurant industry were commonplace among women.
allen: garcia-vera's microphone was cut off, and he was escorted out of the meeting. miami-dade's policy change ordered by the mayor won't become final until it's ratified by the county commission. this week, advocacy groups and legal scholars sent a letter to the commissioners saying they believed mayor gimenez was misreading the law and had, in their words, been duped. trump's executive order, they say, requires only the sharing of information with federal immigration authorities, not honoring detention requests. at today's meeting, the chairman of the county democrats, juan cuba, called on commissioners to take a stand.

cornish: one of the other contentious policies of this term was ending daca. that was the obama-era program that gave a reprieve from deportation to the children of parents who had brought them to the u.s. without documentation. and the supreme court struck down trump's plan to end it altogether, didn't rule out the policy itself. maria, what do you think is the future of daca? is this conversation ongoing or settled?

[last september donald trump released a tax plan with four tax brackets: 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent. it was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive. the new proposal eliminates the 0 percent bracket, thus making this line from trump's original tax plan null: if you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. that removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. they get a new one page form to send the irs saying, i win, those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each. -tamara keith] [update: in an interview with fox news wednesday morning, trump said the zero bracket is in there big league.]

these are issue-by-issue determinations that must be made, and they require process evaluation, legal evaluation, resource consideration and timeliness, said jennings. in other words, some policies will take more time and personnel resources than others. and health policies will have to compete for white house attention with policies the new administration will want to change on anything from the environment to immigration to education.

as part of this reform, we will eliminate the carried interest deduction, a well-known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for wall street investors, and people like me, but unfair to american workers. tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. my plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.

[there's a lot going on in this statistic. so here goes: trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force — that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). that figure has climbed by 14 million since january 2009 (importantly, this isn't people leaving the labor force; it's just people not in it, period). but while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing — trump's 14 million figure might imply that it's not. and that low labor force participation isn't entirely about a tough economy — a lot of it is simple demographics. in 2014, the congressional budget office found that half of a recent 3-point drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. the other half was economic factors. — danielle kurtzleben]

inskeep: now, let's hear a little bit of what the departing president had to say in that video message last night. tamara mentioned that he never got around to saying joe biden's name. he was, in some ways, still defiant, although he did acknowledge that a new administration was coming. he never quite said that he lost the election, which is what officials from both parties in all 50 states, as well as dozens of courts, did find. the president had this to say, a kind of reference to the fact that he was knocked off social media for inciting a mob. let's listen.

we do have the ability to find out and we will find out. and what you're referring to is in the setup of that meeting, and, by the way, two of the people in that meeting have been indicted already: manafort, the campaign chairman, and natalia veselnitskaya, the russian attorney, who we have learned more and more about and her relationship with the russian government. in the setup of that meeting, the son of a russian oligarch arranges to speak with don jr., the president's son. the president's son is informed in advance of these conversations that the russians have dirt on hillary clinton that they want to share as part of what is described as the russian government effort to help the trump campaign. and the president's son's reaction is that he would love that help. and so there are these calls going back and forth between don jr. and emin agalarov, the son of aras agalarov, an oligarch close to putin. oddly enough aras agalarov is known as the russian donald trump because he's a real estate magnate in russia. sandwiched between these calls where the president's son is trying to find out, is this a meeting i should take, is this offer for real, should i bring in the campaign chairman, my brother in law? there's a call from a blocked number. we need to find out who that blocked call is from.

every day, foreign actors — the worst offenders being russia, china, iran and north korea — are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against targets in the united states. the targets range from u.s. businesses to the federal government (including our military), to state and local governments, to academic and financial institutions and elements of our critical infrastructure — just to name a few. the attacks come in different forms. some are tailored to achieve very tactical goals while others are implemented for strategic purpose, including the possibility of a crippling cyberattack against our critical infrastructure.
kelly: although, is there maybe some advantage to the party to challenging a sitting president, even if the contender doesn't ultimately succeed? it helps sharpen the party's message going into a general election.

no significant legislation to lower drug prices got all the way through congress in 2019. on the house side, democrats passed a landmark bill on drug prices in december, but it is unlikely to pass a republican-controlled senate. a bipartisan effort on the senate side, which has the support of the white house, has not won over republican majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky, so its prospects for passage this year are not great.

where we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically, he said. 2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting.

it's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says allakulov. walking the last mile and extending safe drinking water to those at the base of the pyramid may be just the avenue that will benefit greatly from citizen-led water quality monitoring
congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.
she did not seem like she was just trying to get elected. she actually seemed like she believed all those things and was in the marjorie taylor greene-wing of the party, which i could not abide.
myre: absolutely. and, you know, what we're seeing here is sort of this, you know, recurring theme where - you know, of trump's aides going to clean up confusion that he's made. we saw this when he questioned the relevance of nato. officials would rush to europe and do that. in korea and japan, when he mused about the cost of troops there. and now we're seeing this in the middle east. and what we - you know, this began back with trump's tweet about a month ago, when he said the u.s. was going to leave syria. and then there's been a scramble ever since. not only among u.s. allies, but also rivals in the region. what does this mean? turkey, iran, russia, syria - everybody trying to figure out what it means. and so there is this great confusion about the syria policy right now.
hefei wen at the university of kentucky college of public health was lead author on another study in the same journal that reached similar conclusions. wen, with jason hockenberry at emory university, used medicaid data. medicaid is primarily a health insurance program for low-income people.

it's already illegal for federal funds to pay for abortions in most cases, but anti-abortion activists want to ban organizations such as planned parenthood, which offer abortions, from receiving any public money for reproductive health services. the trump administration has proposed blocking such groups from getting funds through title x, the federal family planning program for low-income people; duran says similar efforts are underway in many states.
harper: critics would say that governor pence responded too slowly. many people were calling for indiana to legalize syringe exchange programs, where someone who uses drugs can bring their used needles and get clean ones. other states allow this, and they help prevent infections. but pence was really resistant to that idea for a while. here he is back in 2015.

graves: well, the argument is that businesses don't want to have a patchwork of laws - that's the term you'll often hear. they don't want to have to deal with a patchwork of conflicting regulations. but the fact is is that businesses deal with a patchwork of regulations all the time. different cities have different zoning rules. often cities have different tax rates or individual tax rates. businesses deal with those on a regular basis.

trump's choice to launch that missile strike was a surprise about-face after administration officials appeared to take the heat off syria's president, bashar assad, saying the u.s. would scrap its previous position that assad could no longer govern. as the world continues watching to see whether trump's attack was a one-time outing designed to send a message — or the first shot in a new war against assad's regime — north korea's regime has new reason for pause.

our deliberations today – not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities – authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role – are often lively and interesting. they can be sincere and principled. but they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time i remember. our deliberations can still be important and useful, but i think we'd all agree they haven't been overburdened by greatness lately. and right now they aren't producing much for the american people.

in the contentious political climate, executives at individual companies were reluctant to be interviewed for this story. more than a half dozen employers declined to comment.
keller: that is absolutely a concern. there's also a risk of the harm from taking down the wrong things falling disproportionately on certain groups - in particular, people of color, people who are not native english speakers. there are studies showing that when platforms rely on automation to figure out whose speech is hateful, they falsely penalize speakers of african american english more than everyone else. so it's not just a speech issue. there's an equality issue.

the dissent acknowledged that prison security is a compelling interest that might justify such religious discrimination. however, the state has offered no evidence to show that its wholesale prohibition on outside spiritual advisers is necessary to achieve that goal, kagan wrote.
jones: look, i think that senator sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. but the way that they want to do things with medicare for all i just don't think is a viable option. and i'm not sure how senator sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. that's just one issue. i think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. but my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.
the trump administration's proposal, corlette said, is nibbling away at the margins.
still, he says, it's a gray area in the law to determine how much money a company is required to spend. but even if it really costs amtrak $25,000 to take a train car out of service and pull up the seats, mook says, that doesn't end the story ...

when you're trying to focus on aspects of high school life — getting homework done, studying for tests, preparing yourself for college — and you have to worry about being seen as who you are in a class environment, and you have to worry about planning restroom trips and you have to worry about being embarrassed and stigmatized every time you have to raise your hand and say, 'can i go to the bathroom,' it redirects your attention in a very, very significant way, and to something that's so profoundly negative, grimm explained to npr's ari shapiro.

as things stand now, the direct-care model can create difficulties for some patients. take the situation in which someone in this sort of practice goes to his primary care provider for an earache, but antibiotics don't work and he needs to be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist. that patient, who likely has a high-deductible insurance policy to cover care that goes beyond the primary practitioner's purview, will probably be on the hook financially for the entire cost of medical services provided by the specialist — rather than insurance paying a share.

immigration hard-liners say it would be a mistake to end the travel ban completely. they argue that the ban puts pressure on foreign governments affected by the travel ban — those in countries like iran, syria and libya — to improve their own security vetting for travelers to the united states.
the aid groups call it crop dumping and warn that it will deliver an economic blow to struggling haitian peanut farmers. critics say it's poor aid policy that will have long-term negative impacts on haitian communities.
in 1938, jerry siegel and joe shuster — two jewish kids from cleveland who were reading the alarming news coming out of europe — created precisely the hero necessary to put things right: an impossibly strong and nigh-invulnerable paragon of virtue and butt-kicking they called superman. he could have ended hitler's advance with a snap of his fingers — and he definitely would have, if only he weren't a creature of pure fantasy. three years later, as the nazi threat escalated, joe simon and jack kirby went a step further, summoning into being a hero who was essentially an american flag come to dynamic, hitler-punching life. they called him captain america, because subtlety is not what superhero comics are about.

preventing rebel fighters from getting life-saving supplies is part of the government's military strategy, says nathanael chouraqui, a lead middle east researcher at iguacu, a nonprofit that studies humanitarian crises and charities. so manipulating aid shipments is a tool, he says. they want to control what, so to speak, the enemy gets.
china, for its part, says it has already increased the presence of security agents on its border with north korea, signed on to u.n. sanctions packages and more strongly enforced sanctions that bar imports of north korean coal into china. coal accounts for an estimated 30 percent of north korea's exports.

kreit says that while the language of the controlled substances act is broad enough to encompass an injection site, he can also imagine a defense based on local conviction about the need for such a medical service gaining traction in the face of the opioid crisis. but he says winning with that pitch would be an uphill battle in federal court.
pg&e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon. a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said, safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders. pg&e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild — and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires.

and republicans insisted continuously that enforcement had to come before legalization. and that was a priority, and that limited the ability of things to get done. over the years, that idea of the trade-off of border security for legalization, especially as we have seen what the trump administration did with enforcement and how they ramped that up to 110 and the ways it was done and how many americans felt that it was not done in a way that was humane, the epitome of which was the separation of children from their parents - i think that trade-off is no longer quite there.

anderson: yes. and obviously, there's been a big change in how that's been interpreted because congress has not changed the law. and, in fact, it hasn't changed in a very long time. and this is separate from what the department of homeland security is trying to do in a proposed regulation that has not gone into effect yet that many believe would much more dramatically reduce legal immigration to the united states.

it can be [a big hit to states that have a big backlog] but it depends on exactly what they're planning to test out of that kit. you know, sometimes they have to run certain tests that that'll limit the cost to the jurisdiction. you know costs outweigh by the benefit we believe.
professor jean-pierre lehmann (asia expert, imd business school; author): japan just has closed in on itself. now, why does that matter? it matters because, you know, we do live in a global age. there has to be a much greater degree of coordination. and you cannot coordinate with a country that is basically closed off.
and that's why i take it personally. my dad ran a printing plant. he had two really long tables. he printed fabric for draperies. he would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen and he would go down the table, he'd put the silkscreen down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, he'd go across the screen, he'd lift it up, he'd go down all the way to the end and then he'd start on the other table. he worked hard. and then when he finished, he would load all that fabric up, put it in his car, and take it to the business that had ordered it - maybe a restaurant, or a hotel or some office. he expected to be paid when he showed up. he did the work. he paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs. he expected to be paid. i can't imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had gotten a contract from trump. and showing up and submitting his bill had been told we're not going to pay and if you don't like it, sue us. my father never could have sued a big organization like that. i just don't understand it.

big business has a vested interest in that argument. a tax on health benefits would be a pay cut for its workers. corporate payroll taxes would also rise if the value of worker health benefits counted toward required employer contributions to social security and medicare.
his father was a french colonialist in vietnam. my guest tells part of his own story in an essay at the back of the book. viet thanh nguyen's parents grew up in the north of vietnam when the country was divided in the mid-1950s. with the north under communist control, his parents fled to the south. when the south fell to the north in 1975, the family fled to america. viet nguyen was 4 years old at the time. he is now a professor of english and american studies and ethnicity at the university of southern california.

now, i can't imagine a more obvious investigative step than getting those phone records, but we were denied the ability to do that and that, in microcosm, was what the republican-led investigation was about. it wasn't about finding out answers. it was about going through the motions of investigation so that a political report could be issued and they could absolve the president. that's not what they promised the american people they would do, but that is what they did. so we still need to get answers and one of the places we will begin is by getting those phone records.

nguyen: though whatever name i tried - see, you laugh. nothing sounded right. nothing sounded right except my own name. so i've always stayed with it despite the minor cost that it might have entailed in terms of not seeming to be quite as american as everybody else. but obviously the ambition is to make americans say my name, to make americans recognize that this is also now an american name. it is also now a french name. it is also now an australian name. my surname, nguyen, is the fourth most popular surname in australia. you know, we've transformed the countries that we've come to and the people who live in these countries will eventually be able to say our names in the same ways that they say coppola.

in the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? maybe not, but it's worth trying.

sharp: absolutely. and so we've got several families there that the obama administration came in and forced the district 211 to allow a biological boy into the female's restrooms. and so these girls are telling stories about how when they're in their locker room changing for pe, they're now uncomfortable knowing that a boy can walk in at any time under the school's new policy. they talk about how one girl in particular does not change out of her gym clothes but rather wears them all day long, wears them after going to gym, after getting them dirty and nasty through pe class and then just puts her clothes on top of it because she's so nervous about the possibility of having to change and shower and whatnot in front of this boy. and we hear stories like that across the country of these girls speaking out and saying, look, we don't want this student to be bullied or harassed or anything, but we also want our privacy protected. and we just want to know that when we go into these lockers and shower rooms that we're not going to be forced to share with someone of the opposite biological sex. that's all these girls are asking for.

what the administration and congress must do immediately is stabilize the individual insurance marketplace and not destabilize the employer marketplace, said james klein, president of the american benefits council, which advocates for large companies.
i think it's just a straight-up red line, said stevens. this is so much greater than any differences over tax policy or trade policy. it's a fundamental belief in whether or not you want to continue the american experiment. a large portion of the republican party has decided they are for democracy if that means they win, and they're against it if it means they lose. which is to say, you don't believe in democracy.

whatever the republicans are going to do, they've got to make it look as different from the aca as they can for political reasons, said edward fensholt, a senior benefits lawyer at lockton companies, a large insurance broker. there are some pieces that aren't broken, and the more you ... make something different from the aca, the more you risk screwing up things that look ok.

young: well, i can't say it's the new normal forever because it may change. right now, it's normal. and it was a - it's a, again, a result, i think - and i'm very critical of the media because we do not get news anymore. we get opinions. it's opinionated information. and so they don't really look or read or understand that there is another side to the issue. and again, we are a reflection - the congress is a reflection of the people they represent. that's all we are. and if the public has this feeling we can't work together, the congress is not going to work together.
ariel ruiz soto, a policy analyst at the migration policy institute in washington, d.c., says he doesn't think it's likely that many of the hondurans in this current caravan will make it all the way to the u.s. frontier. i suspect that if this caravan actually made it to the guatemalan/mexico border that there would be even the heavier presence of (mexican) national guard to try to detain the migrants, he says. we saw this again in october. that caravan really stopped in guatemala at that time. so i don't foresee them getting to the u.s./mexico border in large numbers.

it's what makes those revelations so explosive, because ultimately, what's at stake here is his moral authority to deal with this unfinished bit of business. because what people will ask is: is it credible to believe that benedict can crack heads with other bishops if, at least prior to 2001, his own record really isn't any better? and that's the hard question the pope is going to have to answer.

the speech was more a litany of what trump doesn't think has worked rather than a prescription of specifics — he did not mention his wall with mexico and only alluded to his call for a temporary ban on muslims coming into the u.s. but his 38-minute remarks did offer a peek into trump's worldview, a window into a 'trump doctrine' that is reflexively protectionist, against nation-building — underlined by the slogan 'america first' — and reliant on a backbone of military strength. it also gave trump the opportunity to appear more serious and less bombastic. if there are two trumps, as ben carson has said, this was 'presidential trump.' there were no 'lyin' ted' references or mocking of john kasich's eating habits.
though companies can't directly donate to campaigns, the ruling gave them power to freely spend money in support or opposition of political candidates on the federal, state or local level. this led to the creation of a new type of political fundraising vehicle called superpacs, which contributed to the explosive growth of campaign spending. they now outspend the national political parties.

estrin: israelis really just want to be at the table. they want to be at the table with the u.s. from the get-go because biden has indicated he wants to enter some kind of deal again with iran to curb its nuclear enrichment in exchange for lifting sanctions. israel opposes making a deal with iran and says that would just strengthen a regime that seeks to dominate the region and arm israel's enemies. so already, the israelis are publicly at odds with president biden, you know, on day 1. and the incoming secretary of state - or biden's pick for secretary of state, tony blinken, is trying to reassure israel it will be consulted on iran policy.

and the other reason why the confession became really important to the novel is that it's confession written from one vietnamese person to another vietnamese person who was the interrogator. and what that meant was that what i could do in the novel was to construct an implied audience of vietnamese people. so it was vietnamese people talking to vietnamese people, which is not how minority literature typically works in this country. typically if you're a minority writer in this country you're expected to write towards the white audience. i mean, the literary industry is 89 percent white. they're the first line of defense in terms of getting published in this country and minority writers understand that. and i really did not want to write this novel with a first audience of white americans. i wanted to write it with a first audience of other vietnamese people. and i knew that this would fundamentally change the way that the novel was written and how it would situate the american readership.

last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states — a dramatic increase. these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico. women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system, trump said.
with no permanent administrator in place for those discussions, fema is one of the agencies that have been targeted for significant cuts under the budget the president submitted to congress. under that budget, a program that helps states and communities take long-term measures to reduce losses from disasters, the pre-disaster mitigation grant program, has been cut by more than 60 percent. the budget also eliminates funding for an ongoing effort to improve and redraw the nation's flood maps.

joan alker, the author of the georgetown report, says the trump administration's effort to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration is one of many factors driving up the uninsured rates. and it's especially perceptible in texas, where a quarter of children have a parent who is either undocumented, or who is trying to become a legal resident.
and trump? he may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength. fear that we can't compete with the rest of the world even when the rules are fair. fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls.

to its credit, says bowman, the trump administration explicitly shifted the pentagon's focus to great-power competition, meaning china and russia, no longer making anti-terrorism efforts a priority. that came through a national defense strategy crafted by trump's first defense secretary, james mattis.

but the mask-wearing policies in other country do not necessarily reflect a more authoritian government, say some of npr's interviewees. perhaps we have a bit too glibly dismissed the chinese approach by saying that it's an authoritarian system. lim says, people are obedient, but it's really not about being [in] authoritarian [systems]. it's fundamentally accepting that society comes before self and putting the greater good ahead of one's own interests.
i'm very much satisfied that the sale to hilco is the highest bid and sale, judge kevin gross said wednesday evening. clearly is in the best interest of the community as well, given the risks that were attended to the prior operations with the refinery, and a refinery frankly that had numerous and repeated problems over the years. and i see no reason to think that that wouldn't have continued.

what i do know in general is that their life as shopkeepers was intensely difficult. they literally worked seven days a week every day of the year except christmas, new year's and easter. and they literally worked 12 to 14 hour days. they would work at the store. and then they would come back. they would cook dinner or barely cook dinner. they were - you know, dinner was a really horrible experience. and then i would help them, you know, do the checks and tabulate the accounts. and, you know, by the time i was 10 or 11, i was helping to do the accounting.
soleimani was one of iran's most powerful and shadowy figures. as leader of the quds force, he was said to be responsible for the country's development and coordination with militias and proxy forces throughout the middle east. u.s. officials accuse him of coordinating iraqi militia attacks on u.s. forces in iraq.

donald trump campaigned hard on military issues.
petraeus: ...iran now respond? well, i think iran is not in the strongest of positions, given the sanctions, a dismal economy and widespread iranian popular unrest. so i tend to think it is more likely that we will see a variety of proxy attacks. and again, iran has a lot of proxies throughout the region, thanks to the efforts of qassem soleimani. but really, this comes down to whether or not this has restored some degree of deterrence, which clearly was lacking, given what iran and their proxies were doing throughout the region, and steadily ratcheting the efforts upward.

but when reports began to surface in 2014 and 2015 that seafood harvested or processed by forced labor was making it into the supply chains of major u.s. retailers like walmart, kroger, safeway and restaurants like red lobster, corporations were quick to make public commitments and include stronger language in their supplier guidelines in hopes of addressing the problem. delivering on those promises, however, has proved harder. traceability alone hasn't been enough. until now, retailers have had few tools to make it easier to identify which fisheries are actually at higher risk for human rights abuses.

1. bush fatigue: like fivethiryeight, the post names bush fatigue as a big problem, but ... 2. tv's decreased influence: it also argues that the bush campaign miscalculated the role and power of money and traditional television commercials in the 2016 race. basically, bush's team thought what worked 20 years ago — or even last cycle — in presidential campaigns could work today. but the rise of trump, and his strategy of using earned and new media (just look at his instagram) made much of those old practices obsolete. 3. outdated campaign/message: and that leads to the third reason — running a campaign that, whether deliberate or not, was rooted in the past, managed by loyalists who admired bush and enjoyed his confidence but who, like the candidate, found themselves in unfamiliar political terrain.

but here, the play differs from the film. actor bryan cranston — as beale — rushes into the tv studio, then spends seemingly endless silent minutes grasping for words. cranston says it's like the experience of waking up from a vivid dream, and we think 'oh, this is indelible!' and you start to try to recall it, and it dissipates, like fog. and so he collapses from that. and out of that despair and public humiliation comes the speech. cranston actually wells up with tears when he finally speaks.

quite the contrary. michael cohen testified it was over at the beginning of the year 2016. we now know it went on through the middle of that year. even when donald trump was the presumptive republican nominee for president and was denying any business dealings with russia, he was in fact pursuing a multi-multi-million dollar project in moscow and seeking the kremlin's help to make it happen. now, the russians knew this even as the president was denying it ... the russians were on the other end of that transaction, which means at any point in time of the russians' choosing they could expose the president's falsehoods about this and that is compromise. now it's come to the public's attention recently the president may have tried to acquire or destroy the records of his private conversations with putin over the last couple of years. why is that? why does he demand to meet alone with putin? why does he demand that there be no record of his discussions with putin? this is extraordinarily worrying behavior by the president of united states.

last week, biden rolled out a massive $1.9 trillion covid-19 proposal to help juice the struggling economy. the plan includes $1,400 direct payments to many americans, but one key democrat — west virginia sen. joe manchin — is already saying he thinks any additional checks need to be targeted. the move to add a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is already a non-starter for many in the gop and could also be problematic for some centrist democrats. both of those issues, as well as additional support for small businesses, are likely to come up during the hearing.

i can only begin to answer these questions, and so far the answer is that it feels destabilizing. it may help to explain why i've lately been drawn to some music for extramusical reasons — drawing a particular sustenance, for instance, from the network of relationships connecting micah thomas' tide to immanuel wilkins' omega to joel ross' who are you? to rob mazurek's dimensional stardust to nicole mitchell and lisa e. harris' earthseed. instead of a list of albums, i thought about a matrix of connections. i thought about the positive musical embodiment of a superspreader — like guitarist jeff parker, who turned up on at least six terrific albums in 2020, including his own suite for max brown.

in lieu of attending the debate, trump's campaign said he would instead host an event in iowa to raise money for the veterans and wounded warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind mentality our country needs in order to make america great again.

senate finance chairman orrin hatch, r-utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the gop's tax cuts. should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, american manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, hatch said in a weekend statement.
newsom takes office monday, bringing to the state capital a very different style and set of priorities. journalists often referred to gov. jerry brown as the adult in the room when he huddled with legislators to close their differences. it was not a label legislators much cared for.
the basic reality of the vietnam war that americans can't get around is that it was, in many ways, a really bad war. and so hollywood has at least acknowledged that much. but the way that it has contained the meaning of that war is to make americans the stars of this drama and relegate the vietnamese to the margins, even though in reality, the vietnamese paid the heaviest price. and that is one of the ways by which cultural power, soft power, prepares americans to do the same things over again, that now as we confront the same parallels and analogous situations in the middle east, the irony is that, you know, it's mostly people from these other countries that are dying.

oh, and the answers to those other questions above? before lunch is better, the guidelines say, because recess can make kids hungry, and thus more likely to eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. and maybe they won't throw food away uneaten. and they say recess should never be used as punishment, because it deprives students of physical activity — which can be a much-needed outlet.

besides the gastrointestinal effects, decreased testosterone can affect men and women, and that might lead to early osteoporosis. you can have other effects on your adrenal gland, and your ability to make cortisol. it can affect the immune system, so the immune system doesn't get compromised, but immunity as a whole does not seem as strong. these are associations, so there's no causality, but long-term opioid use is associated with a slightly higher risk of cancer.

drawing on decades of economic research, why nations fail argues that political institutions — not culture, natural resources or geography — explain why some nations have gotten rich while others remain poor. a good example is north korea and south korea. eighty years ago, the two were virtually indistinguishable. but after a civil war, north korea turned to communism, while south korea embraced markets and, eventually, democracy. the authors argue that south korea's institutions are the clear reason that it has grown insanely more rich than north korea.

police departments across the country are doing their part by holding back arrests. last week in philadelphia, police commissioner danielle outlaw said the department will continue to make arrests for non-violent crime but once a person's identity is confirmed, they will be released. the department is not turning a blind eye to crime, says outlaw. no one will escape accountability for the crimes they commit. outlaw says police will also hand out warrants telling the individuals they are letting go that they must come in later.

i did not want to write this comment but i felt compelled to after listening to mary louise kelly interview secretary of state pompeo. i have to ask what is the role of the journalist? when i listened to both of them, very carefully, i heard ms. kelly hector and badger the secretary of state, her voice obviously very emotional. on his side, i heard someone who was trying to control his emotions, yet not giving in to answering her repeated questions about ukraine. did ms. kelly seriously expect secretary of state pompeo to answer these questions or was she asking them for rhetorical effect? was she trying to prove what a bad guy he is? whatever she was trying to do, she succeeded in making herself the story. the relationship between the media and the white house has become toxic, and this interview did nothing to reduce the friction and animosity on both sides. i am not excusing the behavior of the secretary of state in the aftermath of the initial interview, but i've also seen reporters bait white house officials to get an angry response that they can use to show how terrible they are.
scicluna: well, i think crisis is also an opportunity. and i think that this is a moment where we need to listen to the victims, to the communities there asking that we get it right. this will not go away easily. this will create a lot of hurt. but the united states has moved - i'm talking about the catholic church in the united states - has moved forward since 2002. the united states catholic church is an example of good practice.

money laundering. were the russians laundering money through the trump businesses? this compromise the russians hold over the president of the united states — we don't know the answer to that question, but we also don't know whether bob mueller has been allowed to investigate that issue. the president has tried to draw a red line around it. in my view, the president has no business drawing red lines. but nonetheless we don't know whether that has been investigated. but we do know it needs to be. but even areas where mueller is investigating if it's going to be the position of the incoming attorney general, should barr be confirmed, that the public doesn't get to learn about this, then it will fall upon congress to share with the american people what happened and we will do that in several ways. we will do that by trying to compel that report to be provided to congress but we'll also do it by developing the record ourselves and by sharing with the country the product of our investigation.

barris: (laughter) you know, it's crazy to - before i answer that question - it's - saying the n-word makes it almost more, you know what i'm saying - saying it makes it almost louder when you say the n-word. like, i feel like one of the most interesting conversations that happened with abc was around this episode. in an amazing, amazing way, they were going to let us say it. they were going to let us see how many we could say. you know, there was a debate. like, we had, like, literally - i call it a n-word negotiation, because it was, like, literally - i'll give you two n-words for, you know...

rose: avideh moussavian is with the national immigration law center, one of many nonprofit organizations that have fought what they deride as the muslim ban. moussavian says the biden administration needs to assure immigrants that they will be treated fairly and that immigrants who've been rejected for visas and green cards under the travel ban should get another chance - people like pamela raghebi.

he made a big deal about the treatment of veterans when he first began running for president. it was sort of the issue that transitioned him from birtherism, insisting obama had not been born in america, to more legitimate issues, actual issues. and he made that transition largely through talking about the veterans and how they had been treated. and we heard a little - just a little echo of some of that misrepresentation this morning.
you know, my generation looked at it as something that we took the disdainful indictment that my mom's generation would use it in because of how it was said to the generations before her. we took that away from it, and we made it sort of a, you know, a badge of tribalism between - sort of to say - between two members of that tribe to say look, i know that you're a part of this tribe. and we have some shared heritage, whether i know you or not.

when u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer was growing up in ashtabula, ohio, in the 1950s, it was a thriving port town on lake erie where everyone who wanted one found a job. ships brought in iron ore destined for the steel mills of pennsylvania, and left with coal from the mines of appalachia.

president donald trump: everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. every problem can be solved, and every hurting family can find healing and hope.
montagne: and so does that already raise a red flag about how vulnerable those who are locked up in jails might be to something like the coronavirus?
rex tillerson: we're just about to embark on a department-wide listening mission. i know because i've had a few interactions with people over lunch, some of our folks that are kind of at the 10-to-12-year stage of their career where they're young and energetic, but they've been around long enough to see what works and what doesn't. i look forward to hearing their ideas.

we took action last night to stop a war. we did not take action to start a war, trump said friday afternoon from his mar-a-lago resort in florida.
but we've also seen the terrible obama-clinton judgment right here for everybody to see in detroit. hillary clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. she supported bill clinton's nafta, she supported china's entrance into the world trade organization, she supported job-killing trade deal and that was a really bad one with south korea, and she supports the trans-pacific partnership. not now, but very soon if she wins and we can't let her win. cause that will be a disaster for detroit and everybody else.

gross: so in breaking bad, you have one of the really great - (laughter) great horrible death scenes. and it's a - now a very famous scene. you are blown up in an explosion intended to kill you. so the explosion happens behind closed doors. and then we assume you could not have survived that, but then you open the door and stumble out and straighten your tie in that still very meticulous way. and i'm thinking, like, what (laughter)?
what is revolutionary about that, sanders said at a rally last month in kentucky, is we have shown the world that we can run a winning national campaign without being dependent on powerful and wealthy special interests.
matthew levitt, a security expert with the washington institute for near east policy, says the stepped-up egyptian security presence is in the government's interest.
ford: well, for example, the trump administration applied punitive sanctions against turkish exports to the united states because of the case of the american pastor andrew brunson, who had been held by the turks for years. would those sanctions be reimposed again? it's not clear. again, you know, diplomacy by tweet can raise as many questions as it answers.

[this moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of trump's policies together. they projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. ultimately, they wrote, the u.s. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. that said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the upshot's neil irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. — danielle kurtzleben]
khalid: the man in the trump 2020 hat is allan kingery. he works at a local egg processing plant, and he says he's most likely going to vote for trump for reelection. but as different as buttigieg and trump might seem, kingery says he notices one similarity.

as npr has reported previously, noncollege white voters, especially men, are one of the most consistently republican voting blocs — so-called reagan democrats.
in april 2009, douglas j. band, who led the foundation's clinton global initiative, emailed ms. abedin and cheryl d. mills, another top adviser to mrs. clinton, for help with a donor. mr. band wrote that he needed to connect gilbert chagoury, a lebanese-nigerian billionaire who was one of the foundation's top donors, with someone at the state department to talk about his interests in lebanon.  'it's jeff feltman,' ms. abedin answered, referring to jeffrey feltman, who was the american ambassador to lebanon at the time. 'i'm sure he knows him. i'll talk to jeff.' mr. band asked her to call mr. chagoury immediately if possible. 'this is very important,' he wrote.

press reports in manila and mindanao have speculated that meiring worked for the cia at a time when the u.s. was bolstering its military presence in mindanao as part of the post-sept. 11 war on terrorism. meiring's ability to travel around mindanao, including rebel-held areas, only fueled speculation here that he was part of a larger, clandestine operation to destabilize mindanao. it would be a pretext to justify manila to allow a bigger u.s. presence in the region.
klain also said the administration will move immediately to rejoin the paris climate accords, a topic that could come up on tuesday. but after president trump's america first mantra, blinken has vowed to restore america's credibility on the global stage. he will also face questions about how he will approach strained relationships with key allies and handle rising threats from iran, north korea, russia and china.
this is because some listen to the scientists or the dr. faucis [the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases] of the world. there's another group that will listen to their local mayor. there's another group who might resonate with the governor. there's another group that might listen to president trump. brownson says.
judd: in certain areas, i would - absolutely. but what we're talking about is when we build walls - if you look at where the fences are currently, we have our fences in urban areas. and we have to have those fences in those urban areas. but what we need is we need a double fence. a single fence - i can't control the south side of that fence. the smugglers control the south side of the fence. i can control the north side of the fence, but i can't control the south side.

this is a wonderful point, and it's such a vexing issue for anyone who treats chronic pain. some of the treatments that have been proven more effective, and safer, and have better outcomes, such as physical therapy, may have a $20 to $40 copay, for each visit, versus an opioid which might have a $5 copay for an entire month's supply.

another humiliation came when president obama drew a red line in syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. in libya, our consulate – the symbol of american prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.
that may be easier said than done. shortly before clinton spoke in cleveland, fbi director james comey told reporters that alleged shooter mateen had been the subject of two different federal investigations, including an extensive probe that lasted 10 months. neither investigation turned up evidence that the fbi could act on.

keith: yeah. he has certainly hinted, and we have reporting that he's had lengthy discussions with his aides over the last couple of months about trying to launch some sort of new campaign to run again in 2024 to win back the presidency. but all of that is seriously in question after january 6, when there was an insurrection inspired by his words and his inability to admit that he had lost a free and fair election. and as a result of that, he has been impeached by the house. he is the only president ever impeached twice, and he now awaits a trial in the senate.

it was the end of a run that had seemed doomed for months: countless gaffes, merciless attacks from the likes of donald trump, seemingly limitless spending from a superpac he couldn't control with horrible returns from those investments and perhaps, above all, a candidate who seemed uncomfortable on the trail at best, and at worst, frustrated and unhappy.
norman roule, now retired, tracked iran through his career with the cia and the office of the director of national intelligence. he told npr's all things considered the death of soleimani was significant.
poggioli: well, depends who's talking. the eu foreign policy chief, federica mogherini, sounded very optimistic after her talks at the u.n., but many diplomats and human rights activists are skeptical about using force against smugglers in international waters and libyan territorial waters. obviously the boats would have to be empty before they're going to be destroyed, and that means probably raising them down inside libyan ports. but that, of course, raises the libya conundrum; it's in a state of anarchy with two rival governments, and the one that's internationally recognized says it won't authorize the use of force on its territory.
during the george w. bush administration, house speaker nancy pelosi took a trip to syria and talked about improving u.s.-syria relations with that government, irritating the white house.
in a 2008 policy paper on consent decrees, sessions described the agreements as one of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power and said that in practice, a decree can last for many years — longer than the remedy that was needed.
house manager rep. val demings, d-fla., urged senators to confine their discussion in the chamber to what she called the heart of the matter.
the first amendment and immigration advocacy
listen to hillary clinton's economic speech 47:36
murphy: well, it does litigate what a party ought to be. and if the party is on a path of complete political failure - and i think in the trump era, some - i would be one of them - would argue moral failure - then you got to have the fight to figure out what you are for the future, even if the immediate election is, you know, not the happy result. so long-term, maybe you need it.
and biden has pledged to reverse a lot of what trump did. he says he will restore humanitarian aid to palestinians. he will oppose israeli settlement activity in the occupied west bank. trump actually supported israeli claims to territory there. so now, there are some palestinians who are disappointed that the biden team says they will not be moving the embassy out of jerusalem. but the palestinian president, mahmoud abbas, congratulated biden today. and he's expecting biden to be more favorable to the palestinians.
we have heard that both johnson & johnson as well as astrazeneca plan to submit their proposals for an [emergency use authorization] by the end of this month or in february, says levine of astho. we'll see how the science is and what the fda and the cdc decide — but potentially the distribution of more vaccines, especially the one-dose johnson and johnson [vaccine], would ramp things up significantly.

driscoll: one thing about wall street executives is they're going to be pragmatists, all right? you know, cohn and some of the other people that come from the world of finance are going to be much more aware of what the implications are for the u.s. and the global economy and for the markets.
vaughan: well, i think it's too early to tell. i mean, the zero tolerance policy has only been in effect for a few weeks. and i think it takes time for the message to get through. the reality is, too, is that if people really feel that they're in danger of their lives, mexico has been offering people from central america the opportunity to apply for asylum there. so we may see and already have seen a number of people decide that that's a better option than trying to make it all the way to the united states with the policies changing under president trump.
athens spent more than $15 billion to stage the summer games in 2004, adding to the country's debt and sparking the current economic turmoil. the games did bring much needed development to the metro system, highways and an airport, but graffiti-covered stadiums remain unused.

states and the federal government have traded accusations over who's responsible for the slow pace of vaccinations. democratic governors and lawmakers have both urged the trump administration in recent days to make changes to the distribution to improve the speed of the process.
prospect for an era of masks
speech is powerful. it can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and — as it did here — inflict great pain. on the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. as a nation we have chosen a different course — to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.
united airlines and lawyers for the passenger seen on video being dragged from a united airliner in chicago say the man has reached an amicable settlement with the airline. the terms of the agreement were not announced.

gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross back with viet thanh nguyen. his novel the sympathizer won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. it's set in vietnam during the war and in la just after. the main character is a spy for north vietnam working undercover as an aide to a general in south vietnam. viet thanh nguyen was born in south vietnam. he was 4 in 1975 when the war ended. the north, which was communist, took over the south. the americans pulled out. and he and his family fled to the u.s.
for many american workers, their tax rate will be zero. while we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. these reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the reagan tax reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. we will make america grow again.
and it was really difficult, you know, to try to understand what was happening to my parents and to my brother and myself there - that there was violence. it was partly violent because my parents were shopkeepers, and this is what happens to immigrant shopkeepers. they get robbed. they get beaten. they get shot all the time.
almost half a million veterans gained health care coverage during the first two years of the affordable care act, a report finds.
the associated press and others are no longer capitalizing the word internet. npr's scott simon talks with the ap's standards editor tom kent about what the change means.
the city has also stressed that the goal is not to make arrests. deputy chief operating officer jon keen said teams are giving advance warning to those in the camps.
sullivan: it did seem crazy. could puerto rico really destroy its own financial interests all by itself, or were there other players who may have had their own interests? down in san juan, i stop by the nonprofit center for a new economy to get some of the backstory. the center's policy director studies the island's finances.
some types of actions are easier to reverse than others.
in fact, you know, one of the things that was really surprising to me when i first began looking at the american legislative exchange council, which, you know, is involved in these fights, was that not only did they oppose increasing the minimum wage, they opposed even having a minimum wage. and we've certainly seen some of that rhetoric on a campaign trail in this primary season as well.
during the set, there had been moments when dyson's drumming in particular caused both of us to shake our heads, murmuring low, appreciative noises. at one point i leaned over to remark how dejohnette might be experiencing this performance, by an exemplary young inheritor of his style. in fact, parks was so taken with dyson's groove that he asked him to join his quartet for a forthcoming gig at the jazz gallery. it's happening as a livestream on jan. 21, with immanuel wilkins on alto saxophone and ben street on bass. my critical opinion is that it will be well worth watching. i'd hasten to add a disclosure, but that's probably unnecessary if you've read this far.
ivo van hove is directing the stage show. he says he first saw network in a belgian movie theater when he was a young man. my memory of it is that it felt like science fiction, he says. something which was impossible, which could never ever happen. when i read the script, now a few years ago, i thought well, this is the world that we live in today. so this was also the challenge, of course, how to make this work that was a little bit of a parody in its time — how to turn it into a tragedy.
sagal: cat owners are equally upset because their policies exclude most common cat activities, which include, quote, lying around, and, quote, plotting our deaths.
that all changed following the violent riots that overtook the capitol earlier this week after a deluge of posts attempting to sabotage the result of the presidential election.
there have been some things that have not worked great with the affordable care act; there are some things that have worked pretty darn well, lee says. let's make sure the laboratory of the states is a laboratory that's sharing the lessons of success and failure with one another.
even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, ocasio-cortez told npr's steve inskeep in an interview that aired thursday on morning edition.
compounding advocates' concerns is the fact that these coverage changes are frequently not communicated clearly to patients, schmid says. they are typically buried deep in the plan documents and don't appear in the user-friendly summary of benefits and coverage that consumers receive from their health plan.
this is a country where peanut production is a huge source of livelihood for up to a half-million people, especially women, if you include the supply chains that process the peanuts, says claire gilbert, spokesperson for grassroots international, a boston-based nonprofit that supports food sovereignty.
garcia-navarro: and in this scenario, to do with this particular issue, the idea's that somehow they don't feel that african-americans are deserving of the money...
nguyen: well, it was a revolutionary war. it was a civil war, depending on how you look at it. and what that means is that vietnamese people were already hurting each other in vietnam. they'd had a long tradition...
ryan invited trump to give an address and not a state of the union speech. that's mainly out of tradition: trump, like his predecessors in the first year of their presidencies, is assumed to be too new to the job of running the country to authoritatively describe the state of the nation.
bodett: i mean, i think this is what's happening...
the move is likely to simplify matters for airbnb hosts in the area. neighborhood message boards in d.c. lit up in recent days with reports of shouting matches between pro-trump airbnb guests and d.c. neighbors, and of hosts hearing guests talking afterward about taking part in the riot.
martin: so what do you make of the president's tweet warning turkey not to attack the kurds? do you think that will be enough to deter an action like that?
now, when it comes to creating jobs, i would argue it's not even close. even conservative experts say trump's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. and according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to senator john mccain,
instead, the customers will be asked to make it clear — if they intend to display their lego creations in public — that the lego group does not support or endorse the specific projects.
the green berets could see the progress of the mission on a massive screen on the wall — live video sent by an american drone. the afghan commandos had opened fire on the taliban, and they had fired back. an american ah-64 apache attack helicopter sliced down to shred the defenders. many scattered.
kelly: now, all of this - impeachment - is happening, of course, against the backdrop of a pandemic. we watch vaccines being slowly rolled out. and, of course, we're bearing witness to the staggering economic impact of this pandemic, which joe biden referenced last night when he announced his new $1.9 trillion pandemic plan.
there's one more key element to successfully responding to a disease outbreak. don't panic. gostin says that's especially true for people living in this country who might be worried about the outbreak in china.
mcmullin: it's possible. i do believe that i'll run again. of course, the next opportunity for that would be in 2018. it is possible. i just haven't made the decision yet.
frank kimbrough sounds the first of those chords at the piano: his low, tolling motif establishes the mood of a world lost, with a shadowy grace that was his trademark in the maria schneider orchestra for more than a quarter-century. the last time i heard the band in person, at the jazz standard in new york in december of 2019, those nuances of tone in kimbrough's playing — projected clearly, somehow, from within the richly textured 18-piece orchestra — were among the details i savored. i also vividly recall kimbrough's cheshire grin as he ambled over during the break to engage in some of the usual self-deprecation, and to inquire after the family.
arcuni: the silver lining, orrick says, is that the state's reservoirs still have plenty of water, thanks to all the snow and rain from last year. while officials aren't ready to declare a drought, a dry winter can signal an early start to california's wildfire season, which has devastated parts of the state in recent years.

natapoff: the problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the american criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. it's essentially a market. ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. they're not a result of a trial. we almost never litigate guilt anymore.

and when i say leaders of congress, i mean of both political parties. chuck schumer, the senate democratic leader, is expected there. nancy pelosi, the speaker of the house, is expected there. but so, too, is mitch mcconnell, the republican leader of the senate, who has absolutely tangled in a very partisan way with democrats over the years and can absolutely be expected to do so again. but on the occasion of this election, after being very slow to acknowledge joe biden's victory, has in recent weeks become much more definite, much more firm in insisting on the rule of law and the constitution and the reality, as affirmed by election officials from both parties in all 50 states, as well as dozens of courts.

the answer to one question posed by republican senators must have brought joy to the president's ears. asked whether the president has the best interests of americans and their families in mind, trump attorney eric herschmann recited a litany of positive economic statistics in what may have sounded like a trump reelection ad.
neighmond: jenny and her family decided to fight the state's medicaid policy. they partnered with the shepherd center, which specializes in spinal cord injury and cared for jenny after her accidents. together, they built a case to prove to the state of georgia that it was cost-effective and more compassionate to allow medicaid to pay for long-term home care. at the time, mark johnson was director of patient advocacy for the center. he took jenny to the state capitol, where she boldly approached and talked to lawmakers.
the first question wednesday came from susan collins, mitt romney and lisa murkowski, three republican senators who have signaled they may support a vote to hear from witnesses. they asked the president's defense lawyers how the senate should weigh impeachment if trump had more than one motive for his conduct. the question — like all others — were submitted to u.s. chief justice john roberts, who is presiding over the trial, who read them aloud.
hook: when you are an investor in iran's economy, you can never be sure whether you are facilitating commerce or terrorism. this is a country that doesn't follow international banking standards for a reason. they don't want people to follow the money. and this regime since 2013 has spent $16 billion in syria and in iraq and in yemen, and it destabilizes the middle east. it's a revolutionary regime that spends its commercial revenues in very malign ways.

elving: there is a standard response if you're running for president as a democrat. you say soleimani was a bad guy; we're glad to have him gone, but then you raise at least a question about the manner in which this was done and all the people who were left in the dark about it. is the president, in fact, all powerful now, an autocrat who can kill as he wishes overseas as long as it's someone we can call a terrorist? and is president trump, the president who said he wanted to end the endless wars in the middle east, is he now on the verge of starting a new one with a major regional power in iran?

we could be criticized for not addressing, in my opinion, the policy of skill training for those who have lost their jobs to automation, and the majority of job losses have been as a result of automation, said hills. but if you're someone who lost their job — whether it's a miner in west virginia or on the floor of a ford factory — you don't really care if it's automation or international competition.
it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different, he says, meaning inequality will deepen, despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it.

alito said there is a world of difference between allowing damage claims that have been allowed in the past and a case like this one, in which, alito maintained, there were foreign policy and national security issues at stake. justice clarence thomas, joined by justice neil gorsuch, would have gone further and outright overturned the court's 1971 decision and others that followed in its wake.

there are a host of things that trump might be able to do to improve the u.s. economy when it comes to trade with china. but let's start with one thing he can't do:
will we be able to continue working well together, as merkel asked, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?
kelly: yeah. it is just so different, so strikingly different in tone and message from the outgoing administration, which leads me to this. if he's confirmed, blinken will succeed mike pompeo as secretary of state. where might we see the biggest differences in how he runs the state department?

many jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. and so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.

clinton repeatedly invoked the threat of nuclear war, warning that trump's inexperience and proclivity for feuds would make a dangerous mix. this is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes. because it's not hard to imagine donald trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin, clinton said.

but the fact is we're a city desperate for jobs and we're - already have disadvantages as compared to surrounding communities. we have high crime, a high tax burden, poor schools. and if you impose a financial burden on businesses that the surrounding communities don't have, it's going to be a disincentive for job growth. i'm just wondering - i'm sure that argument is made on a lot of these things - is there any data that tells us whether they're right?

inskeep: if you reflect on this, ron elving, is the - are the lies, the variance from truth, the falsehoods, the distortions, are they ultimately the distinguishing fact of this administration, even at the end? the thing that the president did that made it so clear that he had incited the attack on the capitol was the claiming that he'd won the election when he had so obviously lost, the months of making that claim. it is impossible to imagine, really, that attack on the capitol, certainly at that scale, without everything the president had said for months beforehand.

let's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.

unlike the aquarium's seafood watch app, the new seafood slavery risk tool will not advise retailers to purchase one species over another. instead, we say: stay, engage and create change in the industry by working with suppliers to change their practices, says mcdonald. with seafood watch, we have a lot of advice on what to purchase and what not, but it's very different with human rights abuses. if you boycott or avoid or stop purchasing, it drives it underground. every human rights expert we talked with says you can't boycott, you have to keep it out in the sunshine. that's the only way to make a difference.

natapoff: we've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. and we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. they put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.

inskeep: you know, you're reminding me of a different inauguration in what seems like a different world, the inauguration of barack obama in 2009, which was an inauguration attended by the departing president of the other party. george w. bush had not been defeated. he was term limited. but he was very much at issue in that election, and the election of obama was in some ways seen as a rebuke of george w. bush. very few people in that giant crowd for obama were fans of george w. bush. in fact, they cheered when his helicopter took off after the inauguration, but it was after the inauguration. george w. bush showed up for that event.

earlier this month, u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley essentially made the case for decertifying iran. she told an audience at the american enterprise institute in washington that president trump must consider not just issues covered by the deal — iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, a nuclear fuel — but tehran's aggressive policies in the region and its ongoing tests of ballistic missiles.
trump was constantly undermining civilian-military relations around the bounds of what is acceptable behavior, says peter feaver, a duke university professor who focuses on those relations. this, combined with the fact that he has a tin ear for all things in the civil-military domain, means that trump did lots of damage to this crucial pillar of the republic.
i'll tell you who actually gave me kind of a hint about that - is that - one of my dear friends is steve higgins, who's fallon's announcer and sort of sidekick. and i've known him for many years, and he's a lovely guy. and he said, so how's the schedule going? i said, oh, we're going to start doing two on thursdays. and he goes, oh, thank god. you're going to love it. i said, why? it's going to kill me, right? and he goes, no. that second show you do on thursday is how you should do the show every week because you'll be too tired to worry about whether you're making the right choice. and he's absolutely right.

as funny as the line is, and the reaction to it, it all points to a major problem for the trump campaign. as msnbc, the huffington post and others have reported, for months now, trump surrogates have either offered remarks that directly contradict donald trump's message, or made gaffes that have become distractions for the campaign. many have downplayed trump's rhetoric on a border wall with mexico, with one even calling it virtual, and trump's plan to deport 11 million immigrants rhetorical, according to msnbc. another trump surrogate, huffington post reported, suggested that hillary clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. and just this week, trump surrogate mark burns tweeted a cartoon image of hillary clinton in blackface.

detrow: first of all, i think that this was kind of a status quo debate. i don't think anything tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates' fortunes. i think one really notable thing is that this evening showed that joe biden has really affected the conversation about health care. for months and months, bernie sanders really set the tone for health care. it was, do you agree with bernie or disagree with bernie? and most candidates said that, yeah, i agree with bernie or at least big chunks of what bernie's trying to do when it comes to medicare for all and in some forms of the going away with private health insurance.
scott detrow, byline: hey, good morning.
he's more of a politician, meaning that if trump fell out of power, but [perdue] didn't, he would kind of fall back from the trumpism. i think he was just trying to get elected, so to speak.

mr. allen: sure. well, look. i think you can always find individual problems of abuse if you're looking around. but let me take a step back and say that i think from the beginning, what we now talk about is the sexual abuse crisis in the catholic church has really been two interlocking, but distinct problems. there's the problem of priests who abused, and there's the problem of bishops who covered it up - that is, who should have known better and failed to act.

the new seafood watch database, which took two years to design, assigns slavery risk ratings to specific fisheries and was developed in collaboration with liberty asia and the sustainable fisheries partnership. like seafood watch's color-coded ratings, the seafood slavery risk tool aims to keep it simple — a set criteria determines whether a fishery will earn a critical, high, moderate or low risk rating.

[this is a relatively new position for clinton. for much of the primary, clinton's plan was for debt free college. then after the voting was done as part of negotiations with the bernie sanders campaign, clinton agreed to expand her proposal to make public universities tuition free for middle class and low income students. -tamara keith]

the u.s. supreme court justices unanimously ruled in her favor, finding that the buffer zones infringed on protesters' first amendment rights. massachusetts took the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers, chief justice john roberts wrote in his opinion. to curb harassment, he noted, the state could follow the lead of new york city, which made it a crime 'to follow and harass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a reproductive health care facility.'

passing this bill will mean the end of an historic era of prohibition that has punished canadians with a criminal sanction for what is essentially a health decision. over the years, how many canadians have needlessly been given the social stigma and employment barrier of a criminal conviction?
zhang liangui says the possibility of failure is not one that chinese diplomats dare admit. then again, zhang says, for the past two decades, no country has succeeded in keeping the korean peninsula nuclear-free. north korea's current suspected stockpile is estimated to include 10 to 16 nuclear weapons.

and so when you go into these charter schools - the one that i spent a lot of time in was a kipp elementary school called spark academy. there were two certified teachers in every grade from kindergarten through third. there was also a learning specialist or a tutor for every grade so that children who couldn't learn in the small groups that these two teachers set up for those who were academically behind or just struggling - there would be a learning specialist who would push in and do extra work with them.

sagal: it's true. but on the other hand, all the people who were there and don't keep particularly clean offices have an excuse. like when ossoff is taking a tour going, oh yeah, the damage. oh, yes. this was like that before. yeah, this is what happened. they came in and ransacked my office. that's what happened. ossoff will enter the senate at the age of 33, the youngest in decades. and interestingly, it makes them exactly the same age that joe biden was 100 years ago.
the denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to democrats is trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. the president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic democrat, trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of america.
critics accuse the trump administration of slowly smothering the refugee program and point to a recent announcement that the state department will shutter dozens of resettlement offices run by voluntary agencies across the country.

this prior research has helped bring global attention to the issue and even galvanized some political will to address it. but only up to a point: the investments that are needed to end the practice have not been forthcoming, says petroni. so if we could document and show finance ministers, policy makers, donors and communities that child marriage has a cost to their bottom line budgets, we may finally be able to spur investments in solutions.
the president faces two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress related to accusations that he held up military aid to ukraine until the country announced investigations into potential political rival former vice president joe biden and his son hunter.
because they don't - people don't want to believe that you're both talented. they want to believe that there's a simple explanation of, like, neal's dave's typist, or dave's this crazy genius that neal types for, or neal is this puppet master who is telling dave what to say and how to say it and where to say it. and both are insulting. so i was like, let's just keep it anonymous so that people can't, you know, kind of divide and conquer. and it's just a respect thing. it's like, how do i keep my respect? and how do i keep it so that dave gets respect?
while all that was happening, the women's march on washington protesting trump and his policies toward women drew thousands and thousands of people — and the second-highest metro ridership day ever, second only to president obama's first inauguration. protests weren't just limited to d.c., though — similar events happened across the country that also drew massive crowds. and the protests even went worldwide, happening on all seven continents.
ben cardin: we still don't have really a coherent foreign policy being announced by the trump administration. he doesn't have in place the individuals that we would normally be able to call to capitol hill to review what they're doing in different parts of the world. those positions haven't even been nominated yet, let alone confirmed.

the force would consolidate command of the military's existing satellite systems into a single command. those include reconnaissance satellites, gps, missile-warning systems and communications platforms, as npr's geoff brumfiel reported last year.
the charter schools, while starting out with less money, get more of it to the classroom. so they get, like, $12,000 to $13,000 per student. and what they do with that money is really critical because they actually use the resources to support kids who would otherwise have a lot of trouble learning because of the issues that growing up in poverty cause for them. so, you know, there are children who literally - and it's not unusual. children suffer trauma in newark from having grown up amid violence, family strife and constant instability in their homes.

one of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. as bernie sanders has said, hillary clinton has bad judgment. we've seen this bad judgment overseas, in libya, iraq, and syria. we've seen it in iran. we've seen it from president obama, when he gives $150 billion to iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.

northam: it sure did. you know, he took - pompeo took direct aim at president obama and his policy on the middle east. you know, pompeo never actually mentions obama by name, but there was no question about who he was talking about. he said it was an american who also gave a speech in cairo. and, of course, obama gave this landmark speech in 2009 which was viewed as an outreach to the muslim world.

[his numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate — the share of people working or looking for work — right now is at 62.8 percent. that rate hit a recent low of 62.4 percent in september 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. the last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. however, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. as we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i.e., baby boomers retiring), so the decline in the rate isn't entirely a bad thing. — danielle kurtzleben]
so herewith we present seven facts you might not know about gcf and its mission:
roberta rampton is npr's white house editor. she joined the washington desk in october 2019 after spending more than six years as a white house correspondent for reuters. rampton traveled around america and to more than 20 countries covering president trump, president obama and their vice presidents, reporting on a broad range of political, economic and foreign policy topics. earlier in her career, rampton covered energy and agriculture policy.
russakoff: yes. i want to point out, though, that chris cerf, who was the - at the time, the state commissioner of education, did negotiate with the legislature a new tenure law that won a lot of new accountability measures from the teachers' union. and the one thing that the teachers' union insisted on was that they would make all these compromises, but they had to leave the seniority protections absolutely intact. and so that was the compromise that christie made. and so the seniority protections became automatically a part of this new contract in newark, which was supposed to be, you know, in the words that the reformers were using, a transformational contract that would become a model for how to reform school districts all across the country, and it was not.

the international implications of trump's refugee ban
my point is that we can't have a situation where the president is effectively immunized against any consequence because the justice department takes the view that notwithstanding whether they would find evidence of criminality he cannot be indicted and that they will not share evidence with the congress that would allow congress to pursue any other remedy. that simply cannot be the policy of the congress or the justice department that the president is above the law because that would effectively make the president above the law, neither subject to indictment nor impeachment.
fontenrose: i agree with ambassador burns about the signals to russia and china and the concerns about the debate regarding whether or not there's a greater strength in systems of democracy or systems of authoritarianism. i'll be looking to the seasoned members of congress to use this shock to the system as a force to pull them a little bit closer together.

i suspect now - because now was the moment of opportunity, now is the time when he has been behaving - if i can say this, you know, with some perspective - most brazenly. he has been parading around iraq as if it is a province of iran. he has been directing iraqi militias as if they belong to iran. he has been ordering attacks against american targets as if he is the ruler of iraq, and that's been a big problem.
since the 1980s, for example, every time the presidency has changed parties, one of the incoming president's first actions has been to issue an executive order to either reimpose or eliminate the mexico city policy that governs funding for international family planning organizations that perform or promote abortion. why do new administrations address abortion so quickly? because the anniversary of the landmark supreme court abortion decision roe v. wade is two days after inauguration day, so the action is always politically timely.

and prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. it was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. there are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.

allen: well, there's been mounting criticism for weeks of his reluctance to issue the order. and it was led by democrats in florida who thought the state should follow the lead of states like california and new york, which nearly two weeks ago imposed stay-at-home orders. and other states have followed suit. public health experts also joined in the call.

karen bass: they used to refer to him as a dog whistle, but i think most people now recognize it's a bullhorn. i think this last year has been absolutely positively horrific. we have seen a level of racism become normalized, something that we haven't seen for decades. and anytime you have the president of the united states making statements like he did a week ago about the entire continent of africa, it's - he's consistent. how he views people of color around the world is the same as he views people of color in the united states. when he's talking about making america great again, many of us hear that as making america white again.

chris arnold, byline: gary cohn took an unusual path to goldman sachs and the white house. cohn's dyslexic, and teachers told his parents not to expect much. as a kid, he helped out at his family's electrical contracting business in cleveland. he went on to business school. then he was floundering around, and he decided what he really wanted to do was to work on wall street. so one day on a trip to new york, he went down to a commodities trading floor, and he just stood around outside the security checkpoint.

khan's party ended up with 116 of 272 contested seats in the parliament. despite the extent of his win, his victory has been marred by allegations that the military and judiciary conspired to curb his main rival's electoral success — and to boost him into the premiership. nawaz sharif, pakistan's former prime minister and leader of the former ruling party, alleges that a slew of corruption cases against him and his family was timed to destroy their political future.

the manpower shortage is getting worse, gop rep. martha mcsally, chairwoman of the border and maritime security subcommittee, said at a congressional hearing earlier this month. we are losing ground every single month and there is no end in sight as we continue to lose experienced agents and officers through attrition without the ability to efficiently hire new ones.
nguyen: yeah, and that's one of the tremendous ironies, you know, that the united states lost the war, in fact, in 1975. but for the very same reason that the united states was able to wage a war in which it lost 58,000 american soldiers, which is a human tragedy, but was able to create the conditions by which 3 million vietnamese people died of all sides and 3 million laotians and cambodians died during those years and in the years afterwards.
we can do better. we should expand the child tax credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families donald trump's plan largely ignores.
i would ask them to be transparent about their hiring practices so both the congress and the white house publish and collect demographic data about who they employ. what we know from other work settings is that these data are important for measuring the presence of discrimination. without these data, we can't really hold members of congress or even the president accountable for who they hire—it becomes really complicated to do so in the absence of this data.
it's worth noting that during obama's presidency, trump questioned his transparency and once wondered whether obama might be hiding something by not releasing records.

the existing culture of mask-wearing helped asian societies in this regard — and is partly a legacy of sars. after surviving the outbreak 17 years ago, many people in this part of the world began wearing masks even if they just had a cold — to protect others but also for a sense of being protected from others, even if there isn't scientific data to back that up.
oh, this administration totally took its eye off the ball and completely failed to protect workers. the secretary of labor under president trump, eugene scalia, decided there would be no requirements and just let employers do what they want to do voluntarily. some of the plants put in these flimsy plastic barriers between workers where there's like 500 workers in a big room working shoulder to shoulder that even the cdc said to them does not protect workers unless you have social distancing 6 feet apart. and i think what you saw, which is really stunning, is you saw the administration come in to protect an industry so that they wouldn't have to protect workers. i mean, time and time again, cdc weakened its guidance when the meat industry asked them to so they could keep making a profit. but it spread like wildfire.

on labor day, obama attended a big union picnic in cincinnati sponsored by the afl-cio. he defended his policies, saying people seem to forget how bad things were a year ago, even as he expressed displeasure that the job losses continue to mount — an additional 216,000 in august. even in that number, however, obama sees some reason for hope.

horsley: yeah, some of that depends on, you know, your definition. who is actually being deported? who's just being sent back across the border? certainly, deportation swelled early in the obama administration. they tapered off somewhat in the last couple of years. but the obama administration really emphasized deporting serious criminals and those who had just crossed the border. so people who had been here working and living in the interior of the united states for many years didn't have a whole lot to fear in the latter years of the obama administration. that's what we think could be changing now.

so if that's what trump wants, how would this work? it's a complicated proposition, but dean baker at the left-leaning center on economic and policy research explains in a blog post:

ford: no. i don't think it's a dangerous precedent because every american president can set his or her own style. richard nixon's antics didn't create a precedent during the 1970s, for example. and he was a guy who loved privacy, too. but what i do think is, today, it's making the task of the state department, it's making the task of the defense department, it's making the task of the national security council more difficult.

smith: i believe so. yes. and afghanistan's a real big problem. i really wish that the united states did not have national security interests in afghanistan and pakistan. our interest in the region is the threat of transnational terrorist groups, obviously. that's where bin laden was hanging out when he hit us on 9/11. we want to make sure they don't rise again. but the perpetual notion that if we just put in another 5,000 troops, if we just stay another five years, then we'll have a stable enough government in kabul that we'll have an ally - yeah. we are losing lives and spending money in afghanistan, and i'm not sure we're making progress.

let's talk about south korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many american workers. president obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with south korea would increase our exports to south korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs. like hillary clinton's broken promises to new york, these pledges all turned out to be false. instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000 jobs, according to the economic policy institute. our exports to south korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. what else is new? it's happening with everyone.

the republican has an unusual vp search, because so many prominent republicans have ruled out joining his ticket. but he still has plenty of eager running mates to choose from. trump told the ap this week that he has narrowed his search to five or six people. he has said he would like someone with political and legislative experience to help him deal with congress, and he has also said he would consider some of his former rivals. here are three categories the potential picks fall in (bolded are possible vice presidential picks):

dionne: well, i think the big question about the debate, as david suggested, is whether cruz, who got hit very hard during that debate, was hurt by it because i think that iowa really, really does matter to ted cruz. i think he needs to win here to go on. and he still has a decent shot because he has some of the most important evangelical organizations. and i was down near the missouri border in a town keosauqua city - a little city where you saw some supporters of the socially conservative candidates who were really lagging - santorum and huckabee and ben carson - coming behind cruz, at least in that area, because they see him as the person closest to them who can beat trump. if for some reason trump actually wins this, i think it becomes much harder for ted cruz to return - to go on. i think, similarly, it is very important to bernie sanders to win here because his chances over the long-haul, i think, depend on having a one-two punch against hillary clinton - winning here and winning in new hampshire. and the one advantage hillary clinton has at this point is, a couple of months ago, she was expected to sweep here. now, it's much closer. you can argue that the clinton people shouldn't have let it get away from them. but in letting it get away from them, they lowered the bar on what counts as victory.

i mean, obviously we're successful and we're successful partially because of the opportunities that america has offered. but, again, it's only possible because of a war that the united states waged in vietnam. and there are so many asian immigrants and refugees who have come from countries like the philippines, korea, laos, cambodia who are here in the united states because of wars that the u.s. waged overseas. and the difficulty for americans and for these refugees and immigrants is to think about both of these kinds of things at the same time - economic opportunity domestically in the united states for some asian immigrants and refugees, not all of them - that are made possible because of foreign wars that the united states have waged abroad.
as to other effects, the number of americans without health insurance coverage would rise, the cbo says. because the gop proposals cut the tax penalty for not having insurance, it estimates that far fewer people would enroll in coverage. that, coupled with smaller subsidies to help lower- and middle-income people buy their own insurance and cuts to medicaid, could lead to 22 million fewer insured americans by 2026, the cbo says.
maisie ganzler is chief strategy and brand officer at bon appétit management company and oversees the food service company's supply chain and purchasing standards. she says it's difficult for any company to get assurances that the product it's buying was produced without slave labor. distance, language and cultural barriers, murky supply chains where seafood changes hands multiple times — all make the problem harder. she says america's country-of-origin labeling system, which labels where a tuna is canned but not where it is caught, also muddies the waters.

myre: well, that would be very significant. it really sends an important message at a time when more than 40% of the military is made up of minorities, but it has very few senior black leaders. now, austin's resume is quite impressive. he was born in alabama in the 1950s, grew up in georgia. he attended west point and held a lot of important positions as he rose through the ranks. he was the first black head of central command, which is responsible for the u.s. wars in iraq and afghanistan. he led the start of the campaign against isis in 2014. so this certainly reflects the military's focus on the past two decades. but as we noted earlier, some say the focus should be more on china these days and u.s. naval power in the pacific and not on land wars in the middle east.

davies: it's a little confusing when you talk about corporations voting on amendments and voting on legislation. you're talking about a private organization, this council, whose members include state lawmakers from around the country and corporations, and that they work together and develop model legislation, which are then sent back to states and introduced. those are the votes you're talking about, these internal votes over what kind of legislature - what kind of model-recommended legislation alec will come up with?

that's why i've set out a bold vision to make quality, affordable childcare available to all americans and limit costs to 10 percent of family income.
this style of medical practice is called direct primary care, and many doctors and patients say they like the arrangement. typically, these physicians don't accept insurance — which frees the doctors from having to get preapprovals from insurers on treatment and lets them skip the paperwork involved in insurance claims. doctors say that allows them more time and energy for their patients.

here's how member station houston public media describes the revised account of the incident:
anita baron first noticed something was wrong in august 2018, when she began to drool. her dentist chalked it up to a problem with her jaw. then her speech became slurred. she managed to keep her company going — it offers financing to small businesses — but working became increasingly difficult for her as her speech worsened. finally, nine months, four neurologists and countless tests later, baron, now 66, got a diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
now he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation. but his plan was panned left, right, and center – because it's transparently designed for rich people.
the antelope wells port of entry is where 7-year-old jakelin caal maquin, a migrant from guatemala, went through an initial screening before dying of dehydration and shock in december. she was one of two migrant children who died in separate incidents in new mexico that month, after being taken into custody by u.s. customs and border protection. in the other case, felipe gomez alonso, 8, died after being diagnosed with a cold and a fever.
the senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of the democrats' rich friends who don't need the help, he said. we just approved almost $1 trillion in aid a few days ago. it struck a balance between broad support for all kinds of households and a lot more targeted relief for those who need help most.

it's president donald trump's first official act on the abortion issue. on monday, the new president signed a presidential memorandum reinstating the mexico city policy — barring u.s. aid from any group that provides or promotes abortion overseas. the policy dates to 1984, when ronald reagan unveiled it at a united nations conference in mexico city. the trump version is even broader than the incarnations that previous republican presidents have adopted.

but if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. for instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people — our forgotten working people — have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.

for these mixed-status families, there is likely a heightened fear of interacting with the government, and this may be deterring them from signing up their eligible children up for government-sponsored health care, alker said in a phone call with reporters in november, when the report was released.

in contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the gcf also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. the gcf was set up within the umbrella of the united nations system expressly for this purpose. and its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the u.s. state department.

fontenrose: there was a little bit of a misunderstanding about the way some of the foreign policy decision-making worked under the trump administration. to a great extent, the career experts were the voices that were making policy. but on certain issues, we would all wake up surprised by a decision that had been made overnight without any sort of policy coordination. that will stop. and i think that is what is encouraging people. but some of the smart policy-thinking has continued at the action officer level through even this administration. and i think the recognition that that will now be elevated is bringing back morale almost on its own.

basically speaking, i think if we adopt the premise that this problem probably is a global catholic problem - that is, it's no more likely to flare up in north america or europe than it is in latin america or sub-saharan african - then the truth is, there's probably at least two-thirds of the catholic world where this crisis has not yet erupted, but where it very well could. and so if i were in senior leadership in the catholic church today, if somebody were trying to tell me that we're rounding a corner, that this story is almost over, i would be deeply skeptical of that.

it's a fantasy, in other words — but then, that's exactly what superhero stories are for. it's difficult to explain the simple, inspiring and empowering joy of seeing a version of oneself onscreen, to those who've spent their lives unthinkingly soaking in it. a key reason for wonder woman's runaway success last summer was that moment she climbed out of that trench, revealed herself to the world, withstood an onslaught of machine-gun fire and proceeded to get amazonian on some enemy soldiers. male heroes have been doing something similar for decades, in and out of spandex, but now, women in the audience got the chance to feel the raw and blissfully uncomplicated power of representation and understand what the nerds in their life saw in this silly stuff. black panther is filled with similar moments: a pan-african cast getting hero moment after hero moment in a gorgeous afro-futurist setting where the light is always golden, and the tech is always glowy.

border patrol's attempts at rescuing people and saving people's lives is really a band-aid solution because the crisis of death and human disappearance we are seeing along the u.s.-mexico border is a direct result of a policy that started going into place in the mid-'90s that forced people into this terrain, she says.

this, to me, is a sign of a weakness in a leader who demands loyalty. i can't imagine, for example, an eisenhower or a truman, say, firing people because they were disloyal. they get their following because they're strong leaders. a weak leader like trump has to demand and command loyalty. he did it with comey when he was, really, being interviewed to stay on the job, and comey said, i can't do that. so comey was removed. this has just been a constant pattern throughout the trump presidency.

but then, on the more peaceful side, the pentagon just announced it's withdrawing the aircraft carrier uss nimitz at a moment of raised tension, sending it back to home port. that's seen by some as a sign the u.s. isn't looking for a clash right now. in iran, it's easy to find angry rhetoric in the media and on the air aimed at washington, but also qualifications such as, we don't have to avenge soleimani's death right on january 3. that would be the one-year anniversary. it could happen any time, maybe much later. but no one can rule out happening sooner either, unfortunately.

in 2009, pre-hillary, isis was not even on the map. libya was stable. egypt was peaceful. iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. iran was being choked by sanctions. syria was somewhat under control. after four years of hillary clinton, what do we have? isis has spread across the region, and the entire world. libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. egypt was turned over to the radical muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. iraq is in chaos. iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the west. after fifteen years of wars in the middle east, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. this is the legacy of hillary clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. but hillary clinton's legacy does not have to be america's legacy.

the pandemic took so many things from us, but it gave us a few things too. for my household, a deeper bond emerged in the fraught stillness of lockdown. musicians improvised new ways of connecting with listeners, and with each other. as our interminable spring yielded to summer, many awakened to the urgent cause of #blacklivesmatter, on a scale we'd never seen before — a direct response to the horrors unfolding on our screens, in a virtual town square momentarily uncluttered by the usual rhythms of work and play. the first time my family ventured into an actual town square, breaking the sanctity of our bubble, it was for a protest march that felt both like a civic duty and in some ways a privilege: here was the spirit of community we'd so dearly missed, conscientiously masked and distanced, united in voice and mission.

nguyen: well, they weren't subjected to pogroms or anything like that, but they certainly lived a marginalized life. you know, catholics who stayed in the north were subject to suspicion because the communist regime, which was a really hardline regime, was very paranoid about any kind of subversion and they thought the catholics would be a kind of subversive anti-communist force, and so that meant that their economic opportunities were really circumscribed. and so when i went back to visit in around 2004, all of my uncles were still living in the same compound that my grandfather had built and they, you know, had been sustained for a couple of decades in the 1970s and '80s, early '90s by the money that my parents had sent home as remittances. so i think they definitely did feel that - even if they weren't murdered - that they were definitely discriminated against by the communist regime.

over the years, some landowners sued when they felt they were being cheated. that has led to a patchwork of court rulings in many states, determining how leases are interpreted.
lee: i think he must have been in a different briefing than i attended. i literally find it difficult to imagine how my friend marco, who is smart, who listens carefully, who cares about these things - how he could emerge from that meeting and say that it was good. it was terrible. i think it was an unmitigated disaster.
nothing — not even policy positions — sit still for long in the 2016 election. this same weekend, trump clarified his positions on two other major economic policy areas. if you haven't been keeping up, here's a quick recap of trump's changing statements:
james jeffrey: i found this very troubling.
horsley: immigration authorities have been carrying out a series of raids, or enforcement actions, in cities around the country, taking people into custody, in many cases deporting them. it appears the officers are primarily targeting immigrants who have criminal records. but advocates say people whose primary offense is simply living or working in this country illegally have also been caught up in this dragnet.
in april's edition of harper's magazine, dan baum has examined a new response to this latest addiction problem: the legalization of drugs.
forty-two years after the aleuts returned to their villages, the u.s. government recognized that their constitutional rights had been violated.
davies: and there's - on your website, i believe, there's access to a webinar in which the pollsters are discussing the results of these - this survey of business executives in which, as i understand it, they find that, in fact, that increasing the minimum wage is favored by a lopsided margin, providing paid sick leave also favored by a lopsided margin, of business executives. and yet, the pollsters are explaining the members of the state - the lobbyists for the state chambers how to still defeat those measures, is that right?
nikki huelsman: what're you doing? what're you doing?
meraji: you were old enough to remember this, by the way.
not really. because it depends on what you're trying to do, he said. you may be trying to test the edges of your capability, and you can still also get data from your failed tests.
on that point, at least, collins and the other rebels broadly agreed with the case made by house impeachment managers about a number of amendments to mcconnell's rules.
mccord: i think we have to recognize that, you know, maybe this is a wake-up. like, we saw something that i don't think most people thought they would ever see in their lifetimes in america. a lot of the world didn't think they'd see that in america. and we saw it on wednesday. and it's scary, and it's frightening. and i have to wonder - if they'd have gotten their hands on some actual legislators or mike pence, like, what might have happened to those legislators? it could have been worse even than it was. and it was quite bad. and i hope that's a wake-up call for people that we have got to stop with the extremism and, you know, get back to the business of trying to create a country where people have opportunity, you know? when everyone has opportunity, everyone can prosper. it's not a zero-sum game. and that's what i think people don't understand.
page: that's brilliant. who wrote that? i think - it helps all of us to be able to get out there and listen to folks who come from different experiences than our own. that's how a dialogue gets started. but it may not be - get really honest maybe until the second or third day. then you can begin to start talking about what do we do about it, and then you can put together the beginnings of an action plan. and talking also leads toward - it leads in the direction of empathy and understanding, and you've got to have that to really have permanent stability.
sanders talked about mobilizing medical residents, medical school students and retired medical professionals to assist in dealing with the crisis, given the possibility that doctors and nurses themselves become ill.
in early december, christine ghati alfons taught a menstrual hygiene class to a group of girls, 10 to 15 years old, in the ethnic kuria community in migori county, an impoverished, rural area in southwest kenya. normally, she says, the class has 25 students. on this day, only 17 girls showed up.
countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like syria and libya. and we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from syria.
hegyi: and that's why he's so baffled that the trump administration would shrink this area's monuments and expand the potential here for mining and drilling. he says that could scare away tourists and damage the pristine nature of this place. it's home to towering canyons, ancient petroglyphs and the clear, shallow escalante river. it runs 87 miles through the heart of its namesake monument.

warren was asked by reporters outside her home in cambridge, mass., about which former rival she might endorse and declined to announce anything immediately. let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that. we don't have to decide this minute, warren said.
the nonpartisan tax policy center says that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, for example.
trump said at the time that the palestinians probably won't want [the plan] initially, but i think in the end they're going to want it.
next month, several chain supermarkets in the u.k. will stop selling energy drinks to customers under 16. anyone looking to buy a soft drink with more than 150 mg of caffeine per liter — a limit targeting drinks like monster and red bull — will need to present an id.
initial government permissions are only the first step. after that, there's close to a dozen steps that follow, tom says. the u.n. coordinates with the syrian government and the syrian arab red crescent, a relief group, to finalize routes and loading lists specifying hundreds of items.
bryant says the new rule makes it appear that the nfl is going along with it as well. i think that this has really reignited some really bad blood between the players and the owners.

experts doubt a president could simply ban fracking without congressional approval.
dan blumenthal: thank you very much, bob.
as for what he expected the process of entering the u.s. to be like, honig says, i expected at least as much as i experienced entering guinea-bissau six weeks earlier.
sarah mcsweeney, whose death was the subject of one of npr's stories on health care rationing, was a 45-year-old woman with multiple disabilities. she died at an oregon hospital in may after doctors questioned her quality of life and pressured her guardian and others who cared for her to sign a do not resuscitate order to allow doctors to withdraw care.
headlee: well, since you talked about numbers, let's move on here really quickly because we want to talk about major league baseball. milwaukee brewers outfielder ryan braun has been suspended for the season. he violated major league baseball's drug policy. and there are a lot of reports and certainly a lot of rumors that new york yankee alex rodriguez could be next. so, pablo torre, let me go to you, obviously. some people are saying a-rod should get a lifetime ban. what is going on here?
sagal: ...than the supreme court? it seems like we're talking about something else.
colbert: if that's what you mean by special interest, then yeah. i have a special interest in that.
only weeks ago, in orlando, florida, 49 wonderful americans were savagely murdered by an islamic terrorist. this time, the terrorist targeted lgbtq community. no good, and we're going to stop it.
(b) the phrase 'literacy test' includes any test of the ability to read, write, understand, or interpret any matter.
the initiative has three main focuses, or pillars, as the administration calls it: providing women with the education and skills training they need to enter the workforce; helping them succeed as business owners through financing, access to markets and networks; and addressing other barriers – legal, regulatory and cultural – that keep them from working.
when mark and john were giving me the tour and i was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at futuramic, what i hear all over the country - germany, japan, italy - i want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the united states. there is no reason we can't begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else.
so what exactly was he saying?
and what's really, really encouraging as i talk to lawmakers across the country and in the federal government, is that people are starting to have these 'a-ha!' moments and realizing that first of all, it's ok to raise your hand and say we may have a problem here and we want to get to the bottom of it. you know, there's no finger-pointing at this point in terms of calling people out for it. obviously it's not an ideal situation but what's really been amazing even in just the three years that i've been working on this issue here at rainn is the shift and the desire to be proactive rather than just reactive to the issue.
keith: one of the moments that stands out from this debate was sort of health care adjacent in that they were talking about health care, but it really seemed like former hud secretary julian castro was looking for an angle to go after biden.
number four: block funding for sanctuary cities. we block the funding, no more funding.
if the legislation passes, it would be the first time congress approved a new branch of the military since 1947, when it created the air force.

a taiwan independent from mainland china is not an option, and no person or party can stop the trend toward unification, chinese president xi jinping said in a policy speech wednesday.
the same year, a case was filed against baylor alleging violations of title ix and a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual assault. according to an early complaint filed in the case, reports of sexual assault to high-level, policy-setting employees at baylor failed to result in change at the university.
in addition, each hospital must also post, in a consumer-friendly format, the specific costs for 300 common and shoppable services, such as having a baby, getting a joint replacement, having a hernia repaired or undergoing a diagnostic brain scan.
but numerous manufacturers have also complained that they're being hurt by higher prices for imported steel and aluminum. that includes companies in key industries such as housing and autos.

meanwhile, as asylum-seekers are processed in temporary tent courts along the border, judges are granting far fewer asylum claims than other courts. as of november 2019, just 117 migrants had been granted protection out of tens of thousands of applicants, according to data released by the trac immigration project at syracuse university. that's a success rate of less than 1%.
demby: so y'all already know where this is going.
the idea here, as economist mark thoma has put it, is that the last dollar paid [in taxes] should cause the same amount of disutility for everyone — disutility being econospeak for dissatisfaction, more or less.

if the health law is repealed, that could change. in some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said steve wojcik, vice president of public policy at the national business group on health, a membership organization representing large employers.
i was given credit for being in combat, because air combat [was] allowed. i have the air force combat action medal. i have a couple of medals that denote that i was in combat, and it says that on my records, [but] i wouldn't have gotten credit for being in combat on the ground if i were a ground troop.
but in the course of pulling this project together, our team fell into a rabbit hole over something that doesn't often get attention: the origin of the statistic itself. it turns out to be a fascinating story, and not just for data wonks. it's a story of collaboration across the political aisle, heroic efforts and millions of dollars spent by state governments, and dogged researchers uncovering new insights that arguably changed the lives of tens of thousands of young people.
northam has kept a low public profile since a racist photo with an individual in blackface and another in ku klux klan garb, appearing on his 1984 medical school yearbook page, came to light earlier this month.
with the new hospital rule, consumers should be able to see the tremendous variation in prices for the exact same care among hospitals and get an estimate of what they will be charged for care — before they seek it.
the white house says president trump spoke with chinese president xi jinping yesterday and said the u.s. will honor the so-called one china policy under which the u.s. recognizes just one china and says taiwan is part of it. china considers taiwan a province. there were questions about whether trump would keep that policy. back in december, he broke with decades of protocol by taking a phone call from the president of taiwan. and here's what he told fox news at that time.
it's not that the vaccines are rolling off the trucks and we're able to administer it immediately, says dr. jinlene chan, deputy secretary of public health services at the maryland department of health. training is important to make sure that we deliver the right amount of vaccines for every individual and do it in a safe manner and as efficiently as possible without waste.
the potential numbers in the u.s. are daunting. richard waldhorn is a pulmonary critical care physician who's studied hospital preparedness for the johns hopkins center for health security. last week, he co-wrote an article arguing that american hospitals should prepare for the possibility of too many patients.
detrow: he did. and that's what happens when you appear at the top of the finish in iowa - as best as we can tell, at least. he got questions from moderators and other candidates about his lack of national experience. you know, despite the fact that the current president had a reality tv background, it's pretty extraordinary that the mayor of a city of about 100,000 is now among the front-runners for the presidential nomination. he was criticized by elizabeth warren and others for how south bend's police force has treated african americans - disproportionate arrest rates and drug charges, among other things. he also got a lot of questions about foreign policy. but that is an area where buttigieg seemed very comfortable, repeatedly drawing on his time serving in afghanistan. there was one moment that stood out to me when the moderator david muir of abc repeatedly pressed buttigieg on whether he would have ordered a strike on iranian general qassem soleimani as president trump did.
if north korea is going to collapse, he says, no external force can prop it up. frankly speaking, whether it collapses or continues to develop will mainly depend on its own domestic and foreign policies.
the logo of his new hbo series wyatt cenac's problem areas looks precisely like the public television of a couple decades ago, with its friendly-looking sans serif lowercase letters in earthy colors. the set is the same way, looking much like one that a host might have wandered around to talk about the beginnings of the world or the ways of the penguin.
the aca allows people to sign up outside the open enrollment period for a variety of special reasons, such as moving, losing coverage, getting married or having a child. this provision has always been a sticking point with insurers, who have maintained that too many customers who made a change during the special enrollment period were sicker and costlier than average. in response, the obama administration tightened some of these requirements last year and announced it would run a pilot program starting this summer to randomly select half of all special enrollment applicants for verification review, holding up the applicant's insurance coverage until they provide the proper documentation.
there's a lack of representation in the top spots, says simone, of women in general and women of color in particular. i saw that early on when i was an intern at the food network, especially as someone who wasn't coming from one of the big culinary schools, but from a school where all my classmates were black and brown people. i was lucky, but most people at the smaller schools don't even have the opportunity to get those internships, and even when you do, you don't usually see someone in charge who looks like you.
the same goes for government benefits. the center for immigration studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. tremendous costs. this directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the u.s. treasury.
meanwhile, the ap reports that russia is already considering retaliatory measures to the sanctions. and a tweet from russia's embassy in the u.k. mocked president obama, tweeting a picture of a lame duck.
never in the history of the roman catholic church has a pope ordered bishops from around the world to come together and consider how many priests abuse children sexually and how many church officials cover for the abusers. the scandal of clergy sex abuse has deep roots in church history, but church leaders have been notoriously reluctant to acknowledge it and deal with the consequences.
fadel: according to president trump, soleimani was, quote, planning a very major attack. but the administration hasn't really provided evidence of that claim. the invasion of iraq was also - was predicted on faulty intelligence. how does this strike - when you hear it, how does it strike you based on the history?

her search for her mother touches an entire chinese city
sagal: so let's go over the details of your origin story, as if you were a superhero. was that all true? you used to work in the white house, or at least nearby, right?
you know, it - hearing, you know, the case for or against impeachment, you know, on both sides was really striking. and hearing from republicans, some of whom, you know, certainly were wanting accountability in terms of the insurrectionists but not wanting to go so far as to hold the president accountable despite the fact that he was at the stop the steal rally just ahead of the storming of the capitol and the weeks and weeks that he, you know, has perpetuated the false claims of a rigged election - not really wanting to tether him directly to the events of january 6 was really remarkable. and so i think that maybe foreshadows, you know, how a final vote may go once this goes over to the senate along party lines and the justification for that.
bernie sanders gave remarks early on tuesday evening, but it wasn't the typical speech you'd expect a candidate to give on election night.
but the former vice president fared better in counties with higher percentages of nonwhite residents, beating sanders in those counties. sanders still held his own though — in part because of the large latino vote in california, a state the senator won.
in 2002, partly at straw's urging, gibraltarians weighed in on whether they preferred spain to share sovereignty over their territory. in that referendum, about 99 percent voted to remain with the u.k. only 187 of people voted in favor of joining up with spain, according to the guardian.
i am totally expecting mckenny to say she supports mckesson. but i am wrong.
roger severino: times are changing, and we are institutionalizing a change in the culture of government, beginning with hhs, to never forget that religious freedom is a primary freedom, that it is a civil right that deserves complete enforcement and respect.
mcmaster and trump may be able to square their views inside the situation room, but the problem, as npr's soraya sarhaddi nelson reported, is that at worst, the europeans are already terrified. at best, they are confused.
the time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:
twitter, taking the boldest enforcement action to date against trump, has faced months of accusations that it has not done enough to limit the spread of trump's groundless attacks on the democratic election he lost and incitements of violence sent to his millions of followers.
in the past, members of the gang of eight, the leaders of both the house and the senate and the chair and ranking members of their respective intelligence committees, had been briefed on such operations. that was not the case this time, senate minority leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor friday.
president-elect biden has pledged to quickly end the trump administration's travel ban on muslim-majority countries. but immigrant advocates say the lasting effects of policy will be harder to undo.

change and accountability are, of course, the holy grail. elsewhere, in costa rica, citizens measured the levels of herbicides and pesticides in their drinking water. while these groups are still awaiting recourse, documentation has helped them take their fight to the courts.
montagne: and also the eu foreign policy chief this week told the u.n. that refugees and migrants intercepted at sea will not be sent back against their will. so that sounds like the smugglers will stay in business.
cutler: correct. and at this meeting, i think the united states will be very interested on hearing more details and more specificity and the time frames for these announcements that china has made. and i think they'll also be looking for additional concessions by china as well.

xi urges peaceful unification of china and taiwan, but won't rule out using force
before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done. america is ready to prove the doubters wrong. they want you to think small. i am asking you to think big. we are ready to dream great things for our country once again. we are ready to show the world that america is back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before. thank you, and god bless you.
his words are horrific, but his policies are damaging. and the wreckage that he has done to the government, even without congressional involvement, is, to me, far more important. you know, attacking nfl players, i mean, that was egregious. but doing what he's done policy wise is far, far more significant and dangerous to our communities.
(g) the commission shall have power—
the article names several bush operatives who allege the campaign had no clear strategy, no one really in control and no real way to deal with a political terrain vastly changed from the last time bush ran for office. and they waited, the article claims, perhaps too long, to fully engage trump.
president donald trump: so look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes.
what is the green new deal?
harper: sure. so pence, as a republican, under obamacare, did expand medicaid. he did it with restrictions. so people who need insurance, many of them need to pay a premium in order to get coverage, and they face getting kicked off or getting bumped down to a lower level of coverage if they don't pay. but that program did bring health insurance to a lot of people who didn't have it before, and that helps with public health issues like addiction.
kenyon: the latest pressure on the deal came wednesday from europe. britain, france and germany announced they're invoking the deal's dispute resolution mechanism, which amounts to a formal accusation that iran's breaching the agreement. that prompted iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, during his first friday prayer sermon in eight years, to blast those european countries as enemies of iran.
when i booked a flight from boston to washington, d.c., in mid-january, i knew that sharing confined indoor spaces with strangers was a risk in the middle of a pandemic. but a year into living with the coronavirus, i figured it wasn't a huge risk.
so, we want to know: what are you most excited for once the pandemic is over? it could be hugging your family again, dating in-person, seeing your favorite musician perform in a crowded room or finally going on that trip you'd originally planned for 2020. big or small, tell npr's all things considered what you're most excited about in a post-pandemic world.
$150 billion to state and local governments to address spending shortages related to the coronavirus pandemic.
our policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers, it said.
mobilize — that's the key word here, says leonardo martinez-diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the u.s. treasury in the obama administration. the term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. the plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.
in his statement, northam said he admires the actions the richmond 34 took to fight segregation, and he added that he would pay his own tribute to them at the governor's mansion later this week.
shapiro: what about americans? you're right over the border from san diego. do you see many u.s. people there trying to help out?
an internist and hospitalist, gottlieb has played leading roles in various government health agencies, including as deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs at the fda during the george w. bush administration. before that, he was a senior policy adviser at cms working on the implementation of medicare's then-new drug coverage for seniors.
clinton said she'd make identifying and stopping 'lone wolves' a top priority. she defined them as radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.

the company traces its origins to 1911, when a maine outdoorsman developed a hunting shoe with leather uppers and rubber bottoms. its rugged products were designed with hunting and fishing in mind.
you know, looking out at this world, i divide it into migraine headaches on one hand and root canals on the other, miller told npr, citing challenges including the coronavirus pandemic, threats from iran, and north korea's expanding nuclear and missile arsenal. it's a world where american power and influence is now challenged routinely by china and russia, by smaller powers like iran and north korea, and where the notion that we are the indispensable power has kind of gone the way of the dodo.
the number one thing i really hear about is the fear that muslims have... can i send my kids to school without them worried about getting bullied, for example, or am i safe to go pray at a mosque?
it's perfectly knowable. and of course when we brought in don jr. and asked him about the call and the obvious question was, we know that then-candidate trump used a blocked call during the campaign. was this call from dad? and when we sought with our republican colleagues to get an answer in the most definitive way possible — that is get the phone records — the response from the republicans was, no. we don't want to know.
the deluge of comments comes as survivor advocates have been mobilizing their troops on social media, at comment-writing pizza parties, and through crash courses in commenting on college campuses.
brennan: well, terry, i don't have any.
i was just starting in on kimbrough's obituary — one of about 30 that i wrote in 2020 — when my phone pinged. it was a message from another leading jazz pianist, aaron parks: oh man, kimbrough. damn this year. this was a small gesture, but a welcome reminder: there were flickers of light and grace in our terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year. and among the many changes forced upon us, there were a few that bloomed from within — regarding my self-identity as a critic, my relationship to a community and the responsibilities inherent in each of those roles. here, let me explain.
the chps analysis, based on survey data from 45 of california's 58 counties, opens a window into how the most-populated state is coping with the influx.
and that might really sum it up. the story of jeb bush in this election has always been about much more than just jeb bush. it has been about his entire family, and whether one name should have that much control over the presidency. or whether his brother's war in iraq was justified. or whether his mother, barbara, should actually run for president herself. or whether he was bush enough.
the monarchy sacked the military chief of staff, gen. abdul rahman bin saleh al-bunyan, as well as the heads of the ground and air defenses.
so it became really human. it stopped being about the military and war, and turned into this human story that i never really expected it to be. i ended up taking pictures of love in the second half of the book.
odenkirk: (as jimmy mcgill) son of a bitch. fine, you win. hooray for you. backing up. i have to back up. i need more stickers, don't have enough stickers. thank you. thank you. very nice. employee of the month over here. yeah. hooray. give him a medal.
gross: so you were actually on chappelle's show in a position that a lot of black people are in, which is being the minority person (laughter), i guess...
groves: i don't know. i wasn't party to that conversation and apparently that was a conversation that happened behind closed doors, after your colleague interviewed secretary pompeo.
sagal: but what was amazing was, after all that, all of that, senator ted cruz still objected to certifying the election, which led to the second unimaginable event of the day, people hating ted cruz even more.
fahmy: there's always competition between the heavyweights in any administration on policy issues. what's different now is it's not whether it's the nsc or the state department or the defense department or the congress. it's actually - you're not actually sure what to do because you're watching each one of these units occasionally trying to pull back the president from positions he has announced. it's beyond competition, and it goes all the way up to the top. to be fair to president trump, he was elected as a nontraditional president, and he seems to insist on acting that way.
and schatz may be on to something. when younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like venezuela or cuba. to them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.
if police are empowered to stop, frisk and detain anyone outside of their home, many people will be subject to unconstitutional stops. cpd's enforcement of shelter in place orders not only leaves communities vulnerable to policing abuse, but it also places cpd officers and community members at risk of infection and contagion, the letter reads.
and, of course, that would be catastrophic for us as a community, but also our state, state of texas, and the nation. millions of jobs depend on cross-border trade and commerce, and we've got to be very careful as to how we approach these things. i would prefer that that type of rhetoric is kept out because it does create all sorts of uncertainty in the markets, and more so in the trade business.
mccord: i mean, i guess in some ways it's all of the above, but i think it certainly most jumps out at me from a legal perspective as an insurrection because it was an attempt not so much to overthrow the entire government but to prevent the fulfillment of governmental functions, which on that day, january 6, was the joint session of congress who gathered pursuant to federal law to count the electoral college votes of the states and to certify the president and the vice president as the winners of the election. and that would be joe biden and kamala harris. and so this insurrection was an attempt to stop that and in fact, for at least several hours, was successful in preventing that vote.
trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigration. the clearest example of that was his promise to build a big, beautiful wall along the u.s.-mexico border — a core issue for his base.

trump reshuffled the national security council, elevating controversial chief strategist steve bannon to be a permanent member of the principals committee, giving him equal billing with other cabinet-level officials. the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who are typically permanent members, will now only attend when pertinent issues are being discussed.

what we have heard from the biden administration is this bill is going to have a very broad legalization component. what we haven't heard enough of, i think, is where the legal immigration piece fits. so one of the things, i think, that we need to kind of come back to - and i hope the biden administration will do this - is looking again at legal immigration system reforms. i think that's going to be the key because we have to have an alternative to enforcement to deal with the next people who want to come.

elving: in 1973, democratic majorities in both chambers passed the war powers resolution, requiring the president to notify congress within 48 hours when troops were sent into harm's way. that legislation also required presidents to end any foreign military action after 60 days unless congress had declared war or passed an authorization for the use of military force, a phrase that's come to be known as an aumf. since then, however, the law has fallen short of its authors' intent, in part because presidents found ways to work around it and also because congress has shown itself willing to follow the president's lead in matters of foreign conflict.

brooks: yeah, i thought it was interesting because you got to see trumpism the thing without trump the clownish behavior. so it was like a straight-on view - our first sort of straight-on view. what struck me first was how un-republican it was. the republican party has had three big units, all of whom were repudiated by the speech. social conservatives got nary a mention. fiscal hawks - he's spending a lot of money. foreign policy hawks - he does not believe in a lot of our alliances. but what he believes in is a strong government. he's - it's for a lot of big government. but it's very forceful father figure, very rough government against their enemies.

sagal: here's some of the key news moments of 2018 as interpreted by bill.
legal experts say it should be relatively easy for biden to end the travel ban on day 1 of his administration, as he has promised. the policy was created by executive order, and it can be reversed in much the same way.
sunday puzzle: reverse to get ahead
biden is expected to sign 17 executive actions within the first few hours of his presidency.
biden will inherit significant economic leverage over iran. however misguided and erratic trump's approach was toward iran, the president renewed and strengthened the u.s.'s most comprehensive sanctions regime. trump failed to convert this leverage into diplomatic progress because he did not have a clear strategy or a realistic path to achieving it. while trump repeatedly urged iran to negotiate and make the big deal, secretary of state mike pompeo's demands for iran amounted to a call for regime change. trump also hired john bolton, an outspoken supporter of regime change, to serve as national security adviser. tehran had little incentive to talk, let alone offer concessions, to an administration that ultimately sought its surrender or demise.
zero tolerance leads to high suspension rates
the obama administration has denied a bid by two democratic governors to reconsider how it treats marijuana under federal drug control laws, keeping the drug for now, at least, in the most restrictive category for u.s. law enforcement purposes.
so the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language. says borné. the result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, cloaking it in this language of civil rights.

there's not a whole lot a government can do to change economics, so we don't really expect a whole lot of change to the coal demand outlook from what any administration really can do, he says. most analysts would agree [trump's pro-coal policies] are probably a case of slowing the decline [rather than generating] any real upside.

and today it's also unique because we are not going to see a president stand up and hand over the reins of power figuratively, almost literally, at noon on the 20 of january, as is provided by the constitution and american tradition, both of which matter a great deal to creating a sense of order for the nation as a whole.

the iaea inspectors are charged with ensuring that no potential nuclear fuel — highly enriched uranium and plutonium are the two commonly used sources — is being diverted to a covert nuclear weapons program. under something called the additional protocol, which iran accepted as part of the jcpoa, inspectors can request access to undeclared sites, including military sites. but the agreement spells out a series of steps to gain that access that could take as long as 24 days to complete.
khalid: biden's campaign speech is about character, country and unity. it's about aspiring to a better time. he doesn't mention his democratic rivals by name. biden mostly talks about president trump as if he's the only opponent. he is the former vice president. and he readily mentions barack obama's name, plus his own experience on health care, foreign policy and gun control. but more than policy, his speech is an appeal to morality.
ryan, r-wis., has indicated that he would like to target welfare and entitlements, but trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., are not on board with all that ryan wants to do.
sagal: this was good news for democrats that got overshadowed by the bad news for the country. trump republicans to the very bitter end, georgia senators loeffler and perdue both showed their loyalty to the president by also losing races in georgia. this was somewhat of a surprise that had never happened. democrats had never won runoff elections in georgia. it took until the next day to call the race for jon ossoff, but democrats were optimistic because at that point, all the remaining votes to be counted came from the indigo girls.

if the president chooses not to certify iranian compliance, she said, that does not mean the united states is withdrawing from the jcpoa. there have been reports that there's a debate going on within the trump administration regarding whether to decertify.
growing up, i experienced how indian society discriminates between girl and boy children. it's reflected in the number of girls allowed to be born and sent to school, and what is expected of them in domestic work. economic changes are sweeping this country today, but social changes are not keeping pace. for example, with the delhi rape case, it was disheartening to see that blame the victim culture prevails. political leaders were saying boys will be boys. we need to change patriarchal mindsets and attitudes at all levels.
rascoe: well, many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the u.s. to get out of afghanistan - that the war has gone on too long. in particular, warren said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal.
in addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate house democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal.
barrett's land was passed down from his great-grandfather, and he hopes to hand it over to his grandchildren. but without the royalty money he expected, he and his wife may have to sell the farm to retire.
he also has said that inspectors need a reason to request access to undeclared sites, and the jcpoa section on access states that if the iaea has concerns [emphasis added] regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities, then it can request to see undeclared — i.e., military — sites. it's unclear what kind of reason or evidence the iaea would consider sufficient.

the controversial proposal by the department of health and human services drew letters from nearly 4,000 organizations and individuals during an unusually short, 20-day public comment period that ended in early march. in their comments, consumer advocacy groups decried the proposal, saying it would wreak havoc by making it harder to get coverage. insurers were generally supportive.
mr. allen: yeah. this is - i suppose for catholic insiders, the legionaries of christ would be one of the more high-profile new religious orders in the catholic church, founded in the middle part of the 20th century and known for being very - or i should say fairly conservative and very loyal to the pope, loyal to the vatican. the founder was a high-profile mexican priest by the name of father marcial maciel degollado, who actually died in 2008. father maciel was one of these sort of charismatic figures who was very skilled at generating a following, and very skilled at ingratiating himself in senior levels in rome.

at some airports, such as denver international airport, passengers may get a reminder from airport staff — or an offer of a free disposable mask. but not every airport encourages its employees to address the situation. so should you call out a traveler whose mask has slipped below his nose? only if you can do so gently and without provoking that person — best not to prompt a screaming match, which will certainly increase aerosolization, says abraar karan, a harvard medical school physician. instead, avoid food courts and people eating or drinking in the gate area. take advantage of empty gates to hang out in before the gate agent calls you to board.

african-americans are more likely to be teachers and firefighters and police than their white counterparts — in part because of the strong anti-discrimination laws that exist for government jobs that you don't have in the private sector, he says. and of course during the great recession, one of the greatest lagging sectors in jobs was that — in government.

trade has winners and losers. the winners are american consumers. we all get cheaper goods from abroad. american companies benefit too; they sell more products overseas, even hire extra workers. but there are also people who lose, and those people tend to lose big and lose in big groups. in parts of the country, factories have been closing and jobs have been moving overseas for decades.
at this point i should note that there are no codified rules for the practice of journalism. but there are conventions that journalists and most public officials of pompeo's rank try to adhere to. off the record is generally accepted to mean that the information cannot be reported in any manner. and it's not enough for an official (or press secretary) to unilaterally declare it so, either before or after the fact. the journalist must agree beforehand that any information to be provided will be off the record.

simon: let me cast back one last time to what jack dorsey of twitter suggested this week. and to paraphrase him, he said, we took the step only reluctantly because we really do seek to be a worldwide platform for a free exchange of ideas all over the world, even ones that some people consider to be offensive. we have to be careful about this because this is the way that some national liberation groups - the only way that they can communicate with each other against a dictatorship.

disaster agency to weather hurricane season with no leader, proposed cuts
horsley: jason, is part of the tension here that the very things that we need to do - that public health officials say we need to do to flatten this curve and avoid overwhelming the health care system are the things that are going to be economically painful? nike just announced it's closing its stores in the u.s. temporarily. our barber friend there might see fewer customers. how do we do what we need to do from a public health standpoint and, at the same time, try to minimize the economic pain?

elving: you have, on one hand, rand paul of kentucky - he's a republican - and he's been saying this is the end of diplomacy and negotiation and the beginning of war with iran. but more generally, it's been predictably partisan and polarized. the president's allies say it's about time somebody got this guy. and democrats are saying they're glad soleimani is gone, but congress should have been consulted or at least notified, and the usual protocol of notice was not followed here. so maybe it's ok this time because it's him, but where does this end?

esposito: this was not in the stage direction or in any direction or conversation when i first came to the show. but i wanted to create a character that was different, wasn't the italian mobster with the little dog who spoke very softly or loudly, whichever one. we've seen those characters before. i wanted to create someone who was hiding in plain sight. that was my inspiration. that was the stage direction. and so that's someone, to me, that became gus.

the superintendent's comments come as a coalition of civil rights organizations and community groups are pushing for the chicago police department to stop making arrests and other stops except when there is a clear and present danger of imminent physical harm.
elving: this is a moment i think a lot of americans have, in one sense or another, imagined, either in anticipation or, perhaps, in horror. i would like to know better what the thoughts are of all those people who breached the capitol two weeks ago and marched in and, really, put an effective end to the trump era meaning to do the opposite. they were meaning to extend it another four years. they really wanted trump in office another four years and somehow had been led to believe that they could accomplish that by doing what they did that day.

kelemen: trump had been talking about a more restrained american role in the world, a so-called america first agenda. his decision to strike syria in response to a sarin gas attack was another surprising turn-about. white house officials say this is a sign that the trump doctrine is not doctrinaire. the cato institute's john glaser, a libertarian, has a different perspective.
natapoff: i think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. and that's a matter for democratic debate. we will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. and then the american public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.

that means the navy can't change the conversation by hitting north korea with a few cruise missiles the way it did in syria. north and south korea have tens of thousands of troops and huge arsenals pointed at each other on each side of the demilitarized zone that separates them. occasional flare-ups since the armistice in 1953 have claimed some lives, but the peninsula hasn't seen major combat.

and from the american side, i think this is where things are getting incredibly tricky. there's growing domestic pressure to force the united states out because it's creating a situation where iraq is becoming a target for retaliation. on the other hand, it really needs the united states because it still faces a threat from the islamic state. and so i think it's trying to manage all of these pressures at the same time.

sharp: well, but it's not about one student's rights being more important than another. it's about protecting every student's rights to privacy. and so what we've seen schools do is offer accommodations to any student, including transgender students, that are not comfortable with communal restrooms, allowing them to use single-stall restrooms or whatever's available so that they've got a choice. but they also have a duty to protect every other student's constitutional right to privacy when the courts across the country have recognized as implicated when you've got restrooms and locker rooms and why title ix was drafted the way it is. so schools have to protect that. and what they're trying to do is make sure that every student has a place where they can use restroom, change and shower and feel comfortable without having to break down our traditions of having separate restrooms on the basis of biological sex.

president trump last week reinstated what's known as the mexico city policy or, to its critics, the global gag rule. it cuts off funds to any aid group that provides abortions overseas or even counsels women on abortion. and without that money, reproductive-health clinics in some of the poorest countries in the world may have to close. npr's eyder peralta visited a clinic in nairobi, kenya.
earlier this month, public citizen and 70 other organizations co-authored a letter to president trump, urging his administration not to award monopolies to pharmaceutical companies working on covid-19 vaccines and cures. the letter cited public citizen's report, which found that taxpayers had already spent $700 million on pharmaceutical research and development for coronaviruses since 2002.
the trump rule tweaks the formula, allowing insurers to create plans with larger variations around the average. (it exempts certain silver plans for low-income consumers from the change.) so, for example, a bronze plan might cover only 56 percent of costs and silver 66 percent. insurers say this would allow them to create plans that appeal to more customers, particularly those looking for lower premiums. but critics say the move would increase the size of deductibles.

natapoff: so in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which i mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. white-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.

jaddou: so that's what's so interesting about this. this is a state department regulation, which means it will apply to anybody that needs a visa to travel to the united states. it will not apply to 39 countries who participate in a program called the visa waiver program. foreign nationals from these countries do not need to go to a consulate and obtain a visa to travel to the united states. so it won't apply to them. and those countries are generally the western, more industrialized nation. but this - the new rule applies to everybody else. so as you can see, it's also having some racial disparities, which is also extremely concerning for many of us.

another issue that used to be a sore spot between the u.s. and canada is the keystone xl pipeline that president obama blocked and which now president trump has signaled he wants to greenlight. oil producers in western canada are happy about that. prime minister trudeau, however, who shares obama's concern about climate change, is a less enthusiastic backer of the pipeline than his predecessor, stephen harper, was. so that may not be much of an icebreaker.

wertheimer: could there be real harm to donald trump's presidency here if he's so inconsistent on everything from nato to the ex-im bank and on and on?
i want every american to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead, trump said. this is going to be three weeks that we haven't seen before.

bianculli: peter gould, co-creator of better call saul, speaking to terry gross in 2015. the new season of better call saul premieres monday on amc. after a break, we'll continue terry's conversation with peter gould. and we'll hear from two of the co-stars of better call saul - jonathan banks, who plays mike ehrmantraut, and giancarlo esposito, who plays his ruthless mob boss gus fring. i'm david bianculli, and this is fresh air.
keith: right. and, you know, one of president trump's last tweets before being completely deplatformed was to say that he wouldn't be there at the inauguration. in fact, president trump, as we await his departure from the white house, he still has not congratulated joe biden either on the phone or in one of the videos that he's released. he released another video last night talking about his accomplishments as president, saying that there would be a transition, wishing the new administration luck, but never saying joe biden's name. he can't seem to bring himself to say biden's name. and certainly during the campaign, trump had said, you know, he couldn't imagine a candidate like joe biden beating him. what would he do with himself if joe biden won? well, joe biden won, and president trump is leaving office pretty much unlike anyone else.
arellano: yeah, i agree - complete show of insecurity. do you really want a politician who's insecure? absolutely not. you want a guy who's confident of everything that he does, come hell or high water, whether you agree with it or not. sexting - that's so teenager. i mean, this guy, as far as i know, he hasn't admitted to any actual infidelity on his wife, just sexting, you know. in terms of actual sexual relationships, this shows me that this guy has a fetish. this guy can't even complete the deal. do new yorkers really want somebody like that, who can't even finish the damn thing? no. i don't think so at all...
headlee: ...explaining that allowing citizenship for some undocumented immigrants might also mean allowing citizenship for a whole lot of criminals.
that matters as congress gears up to overhaul the tax code. house republicans' tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the highest-income americans, according to a tax policy center analysis.
but the other piece of the puzzle is, of course, what about senior management that allowed this to happen? that is, what about bishops who just drop the ball? who - and in some cases, who overtly try to cover this up rather than deal with the problem? there, i think, a lot of people would say that that is the big piece of unfinished business from this crisis. and it's not clear what new accountability measures the church might be able to adopt to give some teeth to the idea of accountability for bishops. and that, frankly, is what makes these revelations about the pope's track record both as archbishop in munich from '77 to '82, and also as a vatican official.
toward the end of the school year, the cook twins, mya and deanna, were allowed to participate in their extracurricular activities. that was after much upset from friends and supporters and a word of warning from the massachusetts attorney general to school leaders at mystic valley regional charter.
for mccain, however, it presented an additional problem. his strength was national security, and he had built his campaign on his resume as a vietnam-era prisoner of war and war hero. for the arizona senator, the economy had been a weak spot throughout his campaign, going back to the primaries.
we should be frank that a lot of people migrated to parler because they felt they could not lie as freely as they wanted to on the other social media platforms.

just think about what we could do with those $4 billion dollars. we could pay for more than 47,000 veterans to get a 4-year college degree.
sagal: right. despite all this, online returns have actually jumped 70% from last year because we're buying all this stuff. and also, when you return something, you get to talk to customer service. and that's as close as we get these days to actual human contact.
the white house is transforming a public forum into an echo chamber, said katie fallow, a senior staff attorney at the knight institute.
clinton: my message to every worker in michigan and across america is this. i will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the trans-pacific partnership.

this is not a number we need to accept. we can influence this to a varying degree, fauci said.
but he finally did it thursday evening.
dionne: i think the big - the big talk here is, is bernie sanders closer to howard dean in '04, where dean generated a lot of energy in the antiwar left of the party? a lot of volunteers came in for dean, and it turned out he didn't have the depth on the ground. or is he barack obama? i think it's already very clear that bernie sanders is stronger than howard dean in 2004. and the question is, how close does he get to where barack obama is? i think dean - sanders, rather - speaks for a very odd feeling a lot of democrats have toward the president, which is they approve of him; they're happy he's there, but they still wish, at times, that he had been more progressive and had taken on the republicans harder. and i think sanders speaks for that and speaks for an idealism among the young that's really captured in that ad where - called america, which uses the simon and garfunkel song and really doesn't have any words at all. it doesn't have any words about policy in it at all. it's about a feeling of change.
information uploaded by applicants will be shared by all the three departments, which will save the applicants' time since they won't need to hand in the information repeatedly, gao xiang, director of the policies and regulations department of the state administration of foreign experts affairs, said.
and that's why the fourth question is key: who can bring people together to get any of this done?
other subsequent questions afforded openings later in the evening for trump's team to revive the subject of biden and what his attorneys suggested might be wrongdoing during the obama era.
arcuni: the snowpack is an important insurance policy to protect against wildfire, says john abatzoglou. he's a climatologist with the university of california, merced.
in the run-up to tuesday's new york primary, clinton and sanders have been engaged in multiple battles — over who's more new york, who's more qualified, and who can make the most change.
who does agree with trump? at least half of republicans — 31 percent of them want all immigrants in the u.s. illegally deported. an even higher percentage of americans (72 percent) favor some path to legal status after a period of time, according to the pew research center, including 56 percent of republicans. during the 2013 immigration debate, house republicans pushed legalization but not citizenship. after two weeks of flirting with possibly coming around to that house gop position, trump is now firmly to their right in a country that is growing decreasingly white and increasingly latino.
ray has put forward a powerful claim that his religious rights will be violated at the moment the state puts him to death, kagan wrote. instead, this court short-circuits that ordinary process — and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument — just so the state can meet its preferred execution date.
gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with kenya barris, the creator of the abc sitcom black-ish.
after that, i'm going home for a while to treat my illness. i have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me. and, i hope, to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the american people in your company.
[there's also a bit more of the personal in this speech. trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. this week we've seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here. — sarah mccammon]

what exactly would using this label accomplish? president obama asked tuesday as he spoke about his administration's fight against isis. he spoke at length about the language debate. would it bring in more allies? is there a military strategy that is served by this? the answer is none of the above. calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. this is a political distraction.
sullivan: usually that's pension funds, your retirement account or their own clients.
after trump ordered the u.s. embassy moved to jerusalem from tel aviv in december 2017, the palestinians largely broke off relations with the white house. the move, however, proved extremely popular with israelis.
and by all accounts, it triggered what i have described - i mean, it's my language, not his - but what i've described as something of a conversion experience, because prior to 2001, in the very few public statements cardinal ratzinger had made about this crisis, he came off to be frank, as just another roman cardinal in denial. but after 2001, when he actually had to sit down and read all the case files for every catholic priest, everyone in the world who had credibly been accused of sexual abuse, he began to talk much more openly about what he described as filth in the catholic church and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers. and that has followed into his - flowed, rather, into his papacy, where we see him as the first pope to embrace a zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse, the first pope to meet with victims, the first pope to, in effect, break the vatican's wall of silence on this issue.
robert mclean: if we're using life years as a concept, it is inherently biased against the elderly or the disabled, who may not live as long after they would potentially recover.
and i'm michele norris. when the current economic downturn hit japan, foreign workers there asked the japanese government for assistance. they wanted financial aid to return to their home countries until the recession was over. the government gave them money on the condition that they not return to work in japan, ever. japan's population is aging, and it has depended on foreign workers to fill the gap. as npr's anthony kuhn discovered on a trip to the heart of japan's auto industry, the country's immigration and labor policies may not be sustainable.

house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., declined to offer specifics about what is being worked out by pelosi and the house homeland security committee, but he said democrats are prepared to make an offer that includes significant new spending on border measures.
for the very same reasons that the industrial power of the united states is able to produce this vast inequity of death, that's the same reason that the united states, in the years afterward, through its incredibly powerful cultural industry, is able to win the war in memory because wherever you go outside of vietnam, you have to deal with american memories of the vietnam war. inside vietnam, you have to confront vietnamese memories. but outside, wherever i've gone and talked about the vietnam war and memory, one of the first questions that i get is what do you think of apocalypse now? so...
graves: that's correct. so paid sick was supported 73 percent to 16 percent - this is by ceos from across the country, in each region of the country. minimum wage increasing - it was supported 80 percent to 8. and what happens in this presentation that's on our site at pr watch is during this webinar, when these poll findings are unveiled, these state lobbyists for the business community, state chamber lobbyists, are being told how to overcome this empathy.
the admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. some must have open enrollment. others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.
i asked kelly if she wanted to respond and she declined, saying, i prefer to let the interview and our journalism speak for themselves.
it's easier to show up at an annual meeting in some place like london or brussels wearing a polar bear suit. there's not a similar symbol for louisiana or texas.
this decision to forgo care comes at a cost. managing sara's behavior has been challenging, even after the diagnosis brought some clarity about what was going on. sara acts out and has tantrums, sometimes in public places. ana finds it difficult to soothe her daughter, and it's become more awkward as sara grows.
voters are split on the question of a fracking ban
the stimulus passed without a single republican vote in the house and, in the nearly seven months since, the opposition has continued to accuse the white house of trying to spend its way out of recession while running up huge deficits.
shnider: if you poll the jewish community, which j street has done every election night since our founding, you'll see that, in fact, a majority of american jews support pushing for a palestinian state alongside a secure israel.

the answer came back on jan. 2. the cost is correct, the agent wrote, citing a new policy for taking out those seats. the agent explained that it's expensive to take out extra seats and that it means taking a car out of service.
for the price of resettling one refugee in the united states, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, which i agree with 100 percent. we have to build safe zones, and we'll get the money from the gulf states. we don't want to put up the money; we owe almost $20 trillion. double since obama took office. our national debt. but we will get the money from gulf states and others. we'll supervise it, we'll build safe zones, which is something i think all of us want to see.
version that he will write himself. this means that the country may never learn about information that does not go into an indictment. and that just is completely unsatisfactory. the country deserves to know what the russians did in our elections, what role the president played or his campaign associates played. and to have a situation where the nominee for attorney general says you can't indict a sitting president, you can only impeach one if it's warranted — but we're not going to give you the evidence to determine whether impeachment is i n order — means we're not gonna have a rule of law. we're going to have immunity. and that just cannot persist.
and of course, that's very traumatic. it's very traumatic for me. before a shoot, i don't have a storyboard. i don't know whether this person will be angry at the world — or maybe at me — or if they will break, how to deal with vulnerability. you have to be ready for the whole human condition to play out. you go in so raw. you just have to make very quick emotional decisions.
that means a long, unstable period not just for the republican party, but for the american political system as a whole.
sagal: carolyn, here is your next quote.
keller: no, and i can't imagine a court considering them violations of the first amendment either. there have been more than 30 lawsuits in the u.s. by users saying they have a right to speak on platforms and demanding that platforms reinstate them. and the platforms always win those cases. one big reason is because the first amendment defines your rights against the government; it doesn't define rights against a private company.
that's major janine garner, one of the marines who signed the letter. she's a pilot based out of cherry point, n.c., and joins us now. welcome.
the newly inaugurated biden administration wasted no time in taking two major steps to dismantle much-criticized trump-era immigration policies in its first day in office.

clinton also alluded to the fact that the fbi investigated shooter omar mateen on more than one occasion. if the fbi is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked, she said to loud cheers.
sen. pat toomey, r-pa., told npr's claudia grisales that he remains very, very skeptical that there is any witness that is going to shed any light that is going to cause me to change my view on what the final outcome of what this trial ought to be. republicans overwhelmingly support trump's acquittal.

block: that's the thing about what it is that makes aipac so special, which is it's the relationships that exist - real ones between actual constituents, jews and non-jews and members of congress who understand the value of the u.s.-israel alliance.
i've known and admired men and women in the senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of american politics. they came from both parties, and from various backgrounds. their ambitions were frequently in conflict. they held different views on the issues of the day. and they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest.
(soundbite of tv show, squawk on the street)
van hove says he wanted to make the audience feel the intensity of being in the middle of a live tv show. if you have been in a live tv show, it's always a pressure cooker, he says. there's a countdown, and it's 7 o'clock, it has to start. you cannot wait. you cannot say 'stop, i'm not ready. let's do it again.' no, there's no doing it again. you do it once and it's over. and that thrill i wanted to give. and at the same time, another thing became for me important, that there would be cameras everywhere. it's as if the world became a television studio.
in this story, we incorrectly say that the united states olympic & paralympic committee did not respond to requests for comment. it was the international olympic committee, not the usopc, that did not respond.
elving: unlike the first two rounds of these debates, even though there were 10 people on stage still, the way it was structured, the candidates each had a little bit more time to talk, a little more time for interchange and clarity. it seemed like - and more healthy energy. there was more energy. it was a slightly more positive energy with one or two exceptions. almost all the candidates had some strong moments. almost all of them had some weak moments. i thought cory booker, amy klobuchar, pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren all helped themselves distinctively tonight. i didn't think julian castro on balance, although he had some strong moments, will come out of this stronger or andrew yang or, frankly, kamala harris, who continues to disappoint, perhaps in comparison to her one strongest performance in the first round of the debate.
we all agree on the benefits of tax reform and the place we want to land, and the question is how you reach that place, ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong said in a statement. we continue to have productive discussions with the administration about all ideas on the table.

our world in data, an online publication based at oxford university, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. the international institute for applied systems analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. although the improvement isn't in every country, green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — joanne lu

tomsic: ward's family sued stewart and that lawsuit is now in federal court. stewart has continued to drive aggressively and speak his mind. this season, nascar fined him $35,000 after he blasted the association for a lug nut policy that he said put drivers at risk with loose wheels.
if you think that you wouldn't be touched by a republican overhaul of obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again.
the problem is all that money — and whether donors were motivated by anything other than pure goodwill and philanthropy. namely: whether they gave because of the promise of access to and favors from hillary clinton, who was just beginning her career in public office at the time that bill clinton had ended his.

so most countries when they're hit by a crisis, they're taking aid from other countries, from ngos, associated press reporter hannah dreier told npr in 2016. but venezuela keeps refusing to take donations that other countries are offering and is actually turning back shipments of donations that people have given in places like the u.s., not letting medicine in.

because immigrants can technically face charges for entering the country illegally, npr's adrian florido explained in january, the policy potentially makes any immigrant in the u.s. illegally a deportation priority just by virtue of being present.

john logsdon, professor emeritus at the space policy institute at george washington university. i think china has developed the capability to attack our forces in order to defend itself, he said. so whether you call that offensive or defensive they have the ability to wage an attack against u.s. space assets.

for answers, npr's ari shapiro turned to dr. ajay wasan, professor and vice chair for pain medicine at the university of pittsburgh medical center.
smith: absolutely not. and the active-duty troops, i think they, like, put up some barbed wire and maybe built a temporary structure or two, and you can't tell me that was a good use of their time. border security has gotten a ton better in the last 14 years, in part because we've made a lot of policy decisions to do it. but the president is manufacturing a crisis to pander to his base and try to keep a - well, and obviously, he's not trying to keep his campaign promise because his campaign promise was that mexico was going to pay for it. but he made that promise because it played well with the crowd. something that plays well to the crowd doesn't translate into policy. now, to the extent we have a - these caravans that are coming - they're turning themselves in. ok? you don't need a wall. you know, you don't need anything (ph) to stop them. we need stuff to process them. the only thing that has really changed is we could use some more money for judges to process asylum-seekers. you know, processing asylum-seekers is the crisis, and the president is demagoguing this issue instead of addressing the problems that he raises.
shock poll: americans want massive cuts to legal immigration, said a headline from the washington times.
torre: i can keep going, but i think we got limited amount of time.
thank you. small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. hillary clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what i am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won't be able to start — you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. we're going to end it. i am going to cut regulations massively massively.
another shutdown would have been risky, and there wasn't much appetite for going that route again among congressional republicans.

it's possible that, for some voters, a strong economy provides an opening to tackle large-scale, underlying economic problems that progressives like warren and sanders talk about.
in december 2015, federal authorities said, they made it easier for researchers conducting clinical trials on cannabidiol, a component of marijuana. some scientists are studying whether the substance can help treat childhood epilepsy. that would be a wonderful and welcome development, the dea letter said, but we insist that cbd research, or any research, be sound, scientific and rigorous before a product can be authorized for medical use.
one of the real factors for me is what will happen if we allow the political operatives to succeed in their endeavor to stop donald trump, said carson at a friday morning press conference in florida. i think it would fracture the party irreparably, and it would hand the election to the democrats.

what's more, as opposed to traditional advertising, which is unidirectional, social media is a more delicate instrument where companies receive real-time feedback from their audience. millennials expect to have their opinions listened and responded to, meaning that companies need to engage in more two-way conversations with their constituents. establishing a communication strategy that is both consistent and practically nuanced to respond to changes in the environment is a difficult but necessary process for companies to go through.

studies trump cited offer no proof of such voter fraud. and he also incorrectly claimed it was illegal to be registered in two states; it's not illegal unless someone votes in two states, because often voter rolls are not quickly updated. in fact, it turned out some trump aides and family members were registered in multiple states.
brown is an intern working on a voter registration drive at the mississippi naacp office in jackson. she hopes to attend law school after graduation. brown says at this point, given trump's past statements about other minority groups like latinos and muslims, there's nothing trump could say to win her vote.
is there any new deal being developed? a new nuclear deal, something that would rein in iran, something that they would agree to.
the social pressure on people of color to keep the peace, not get mad, just make sure everyone keeps having a nice time — even when we hear these remarks in public, at our workplaces and schools, in our own homes and from our friends' mouths — can be overwhelming, bearing down on us in so many situations we do not see coming and therefore cannot avoid. what does our dignity matter, what do our feelings amount to, when we could embarrass white people we care about? when our white relatives or friends or colleagues might experience a moment's discomfort, anxiety, or guilt?
after baylor, starr joined the lanier law firm in 2018, and became a frequent commentator and defender of the president on fox news. those appearances have helped return starr to the center of yet another presidential impeachment.

bedi said her group has not yet gotten a response from the city to its letter, and she said despite beck's comments tuesday, it is absolutely important that the city spell out all of its covid-19 policies and make firm commitments to uphold constitutional policing.
the main culprit of the intense 2011 dryness was la niña, a weather pattern where the surface temperatures are cooler in the pacific. this in turn creates drier, warmer weather in the southern u.s. (you may also know her counterpart, el niño, which generally has the opposite effect.) la niña sticks around for a year, sometimes longer, and tends to return once every few years. (the last la niña was in 2007, but it was a much lighter one.)

humans have been migrating since prehistoric times. migration isn't going to stop. even if this caravan doesn't make it to the u.s. border, other migrants are already there waiting. some other potential migrants may view the change in administration in washington as an opportunity to try to enter.
osha has been awol. i helped run that agency for six years. and at the beginning of the pandemic in the middle of march, when i got calls from meatpacking workers, health care workers, i said, just call osha. and osha actually told workers there's nothing we can do. we're not inspecting. usually, osha, during the last nine months, would have done 10,000, maybe 20,000 inspections. they did a couple hundred.
keith: so, as with every debate, there were a lot of things covered. there were also a lot of things that weren't covered. and there are a few stray moments that i feel like we should probably talk about. one of those was vice president biden, in a very long answer about schools and segregation - he started talking about turntables.

neighmond: the day i met her, jenny was seated in her wheelchair at the dining room table with her sister. jenny was all smiles, joking that she sounds like darth vader when she breathes. but then she tells me about the diving accident that paralyzed her from the waist down at 14 and, 10 years later, the car accident that paralyzed her from her neck down and left her dependent on a ventilator. for years, her parents cared for her at home, but the costs were overwhelming. eventually, they went bankrupt and lost their home. her sister, sheryl langley, wanted jenny to move in with her and her family.

either way, however, studies indicate that child marriage and lack of education are closely entwined. and this new report estimates that as a result, child marriage reduces the earnings in adulthood for women by an average of 9 percent. in nigeria alone that amounts to $7.6 billion annually in lost earnings and productivity.
dean: yes, i do. i don't think - i think the republicans will have to defend against it. some republicans who are challenging incumbents are certainly going to use it against the incumbent. but no question that trump is going to have to carry and explain this throughout the election.

tatishe nteta: we found that race was the strongest explanation of white opposition to pay for play.
[this moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of trump's policies together. they projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. ultimately, they wrote, the u.s. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. that said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the upshot's neil irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. (meaning the same would be true of the assumptions underlying the report on clinton's policies — see below.) — danielle kurtzleben]
marxuach: fund managers, they will not admit this now, but when puerto rico was selling debt like pancakes, they loved puerto rico debt. since they had slightly higher interest rates and no taxes attached to them, you immediately look like a genius, right? you just bump up the entire return for the entire portfolio. so that's your bonus, right? that's your new mercedes, your new yacht.

president obama and hillary clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the american people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in arizona, you know it. president obama and hillary clinton support sanctuary cities. they support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. they support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. and they support unconstitutional, executive amnesty.

but where was the sanctuary for kate steinle?
garner: i absolutely had that fear myself. i spent so much time, particularly my first few years in the marine corps, just trying to be accepted that i didn't speak up many times when i probably should have because i didn't want to call additional attention to myself. and in many ways, it was just about kind of survival, if that makes sense. and i think there's always that fear.
dean: since mr. trump is going nowhere in the immediate future, i think this relates to his craving need for loyalty. he is now, with some revenge, going after people he perceives as disloyal. and obviously, vindman and sondland would fit in that category because they testified truthfully before the house and that their testimony was relied on in the senate trial, which he did get through.

it is true that 68 percent of americans said they oppose the lottery that randomly picks 50,000 people to enter the u.s. each year for greater diversity. and in fact, even more (79 percent) favored merit-based immigration over family-based migration, based on a question asking whether immigration priority for those coming to the u.s. should be based on a person's ability to contribute to america as measured by their education and skills or based on a person having relatives in the u.s.

they covered nearly every domestic area of american law. and one of the pieces of paper that was in that set was a document that was a promotional document to recruit corporations to fund alec - to fund its trips for lawmakers, to fund its activities. and that recruitment document, called alec 101, said that the public sector and private sector get an equal voice and vote. that was the phrase it used, equal voice and vote.
in fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. when that same secretary of state rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers i know the time for action has come.

the taliban's strategy is to control the highways that run from helmand province in the west — home to afghanistan's lucrative crop of opium poppy — all the way east to the taliban's headquarters in pakistan. american commanders have nicknamed this route the jet stream, and have watched as insurgents have set about grabbing territory to put it together.
brennan: it felt good because it was clarifying. it was like finding the solution to the mystery. everyone would always say - i would say, like, i don't think my dad loves me. and people would go like, of course your dad loves you. he's your dad, of course he does. and i'd be like, no, i'm pretty sure he doesn't. and so for him to say, like, i didn't love you guys was liberating because i was like, ok, great, i'm not crazy because you always feel like you're crazy when you have a parent like that.
first, the iranian president and his aides are urging biden to move quickly, before iran's june presidential elections. rouhani, a relative moderate, is serving his final term. a more conservative leader will likely prevail in the election, potentially creating a window of opportunity to deal with rouhani on his way out the door. but, as analyst ariane tabatabai and i have argued, the impending election will not fundamentally alter tehran's strategic outlook or its openness to negotiations. rouhani's successor will not necessarily be more hostile to diplomacy even if he is more anti-american. washington should not expect that its policies can dictate the outcome of the iranian election, and it should not allow the election to dictate its own policies.
grosz: obama should have dressed up like a different person and, like, someone they like...
the clinton campaign pointed this out in its response to the ap story. the ap included melinda gates, for example, in its tally of donors whom clinton met with while at state.

of course. as a very smart guy in the piece says, look at our alcohol distribution system. we would not call it a total failure because we have some drunk drivers and because some teenagers get ahold of alcohol. it's not perfect, but it's certainly better than prohibition — none of us wants to go back to that. problems are hard to solve, they are easier to ameliorate. we could do a better job of living with these dangerous substances if we changed the way we think about them.

trump said in september that he was giving congress six months to address daca, the executive action implemented by obama on deferred action for childhood arrivals. that means congress has until march to do something. daca allowed people brought to the country as children to avoid deportation. obama signed the executive order after congress failed to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration overhaul.

in my reporting across the united states i've seen this first hand — from louisiana to kansas, alabama to wisconsin, georgia to nebraska. in so many of these places people of other races simply don't mix, not through choice but circumstance. and if there's no interaction between races, it's harder for conversations on how to solve race problems to even begin.

trump signed an executive order that says for every regulation the executive branch proposes, two others must be repealed.
peikoff: no. you know, i don't think that lies in and of themselves are inciting, right? so within a certain context, you could say that certain lies are. we could talk about, for example, whether that one speech that president trump gave while the events at the capitol were still going on and, you know, whereas he ended the speech with, go home in peace, but a lot of us found it not very convincing, given all of the preamble at the beginning. you could say, ok, in that context, he's telling certain lies and that that could be seen as a further incitement, given the ongoing activities on the ground at the day. so i see what you're getting at. but in terms of just lies themselves - and can you say that lies themselves are inciting the real world? no. when you're dealing with misinformation, we think the best anecdote is more information.

it can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. if they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. they may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. so now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.
the fed said it's prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.

fda should not provide long-term financial incentives for a treatment that would be very widely used if it works, said diana zuckerman, who heads the national center for health research, a consumer advocacy and research organization. the goal of the orphan drug program is to make it more lucrative for a company to develop a treatment that won't have a lot of customers.

hegyi: john freemuth is a professor of public lands policy at boise state university. he says industry has been kicking the tires of utah's red rock desert for decades. access to those minerals became available when president trump drastically reduced the boundaries of both bear's ears and grand staircase-escalante national monuments. but in the last two years, big oil, gas and mining companies haven't come in yet. freemuth says there are a lot of reasons for that.
gross: wait, wait. what do you mean by that?

the problem was this devolved from first amendment-protected activity into a violent mob really fast. and at that point, that soft policing is not good enough. and that's where the capitol police were completely overwhelmed, unprepared. and it's frankly unfathomable to me why they were so unprepared because the intelligence was available, the information was available. it was online. we knew these demonstrators were going to go to the capitol. we knew they were going to encircle the capitol, and we knew that at least some among them wanted to do so violently. and once you have a crowd that becomes a mob, even those who had no intent to engage in violence are oftentimes swept up into that violence.

and the u.s. chamber of commerce is, you know, an enormous lobbying powerhouse in congress. and after a change in leadership a couple decades ago, it really changed its approach to focus on the biggest businesses in the country - indeed in the world - such that the majority of the u.s. chamber of commerce's millions and millions in revenue comes from just 64 donors. and so i think you have a situation in which there's a lot of distortion as a result of these global corporations and what they want our wages to be or where they think the wages should be in this country versus what most people in most businesses want.

if you're going to organize the games, you have to be prepared for financial surprises — i'll put it politely — and debt, olympic historian david wallechinsky told npr last year. but it can be done, and it has been done. the london games didn't lose money. the 1984 los angeles olympics made a profit, and in fact, that profit has been put to wonderful use.

schneider knows this heartsick constellation of feelings well, but her intention behind a world lost came from another time and place. as she told npr music when the album was released in july, she was thinking about the wide-open, daydreamy internal landscapes that we, as individuals and as a society, are often guilty of smothering with a flood of unfiltered input and twitchy distraction. last summer, she muses in her liner notes (referring to 2019, not 2020), an old high school classmate told me how kids in our hometown no longer socially gather to the degree we did years ago. he said kids largely keep isolated, as they're drawn into their individual electronic worlds. when i reread that anecdote early last week — just after the holiday break, as my own children were plugging back into their school-issued chromebooks at our dining room table — it struck an even more despondent chord than the ones schneider wrote into the song.

why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something? — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) october 30, 2012
liasson: there's a very long list. nato was obsolete. now it's not obsolete. china was manipulating its currency. now it doesn't manipulate its currency. the export-import bank was crony capitalism. now it's important to small businesses. president obama wasn't transparent enough. now donald trump has reversed the obama policy and has decided to keep the white house visitor logs secret. so the list goes on and on. now, all presidents change their positions when they come into office. this is kind of like reality television without the television. but even though donald trump trumpets his flexibility as an important part of his leadership style, this is really policy whiplash.

trump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the gcf's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. and various analysts say the loss of u.s. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the u.s. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.
ah, but those were simpler times.

but there's also an argument that, right now, whatever biden might say doesn't matter that much. this part of the campaign is a referendum on trump and his leadership in this crisis. it will become a binary choice, but later on in the fall. so the campaign is going to get shrunk into a narrower window of time. and maybe some voters are going to be happy about that.

the think pieces about the millennials have been written, dissected and rewritten. although each generation bemoans the faults of the following ones, perhaps it's time we give millennials credit where credit is due: they are forcing business to do good while doing well. companies need to rise to this challenge quickly or risk becoming an anachronism.

[in a footnote to the speech, trump pointed to a december 2015 cbo working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million full-time-equivalent workers than it would be without obamacare — meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million fte workers. however, that's not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the u.s. economy: some people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would, the cbo reported. in other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working. — danielle kurtzleben]
but this time, you know, he kind of stood back. he stood a bit back with the first lady as he made these remarks and talked about how this was a, you know, an honor of the lifetime. he looked up at the white house several times in a somewhat of a longing way. you know, he thanked the american people. he thanked us. and, you know, he kind of ended on a note saying that this was not necessarily the end. but it was certainly a moment that he did not necessarily - you know, that i'm not sure he expected, and it's certainly not one that he was really hoping for in the last few weeks.

as is often the case, crises beget crises — and in south sudan, the civil war catalyzed an economic collapse. by 2017, oil production — which makes up more than 99 percent of the country's export revenue and about 60 percent of its gross domestic product (gdp) — had dropped to half its pre-war levels. according to the world bank, gdp per capita fell from $1,111 in 2014 to less than $200 last year. in response to the fiscal deficit, the government printed more banknotes and, unsurprisingly, inflation soared.

tillerson then went to the white house, where trump seemed to contradict him, putting the focus squarely back on qatar. at a joint news conference with his romanian counterpart, trump described his recent visit to riyadh, where nations came together and spoke to me about confronting qatar over its behavior. so we had a decision to make. do we take the easy road or do we finally take hard but necessary action? he said, adding he decided the time had come to call on qatar to end its funding.

--fit on a postcard? trump's treasury secretary said this plan would seek to simplify the tax code by allowing people to fill out their taxes on a large postcard. while people always like the idea of making it easier to fill out their taxes, they might not like what benefits they'd potentially lose. it could mean doing away with popular deductions like the home mortgage deduction, something that back in december mnuchin said trump's plan would scale back.

rose: not that long ago, u.s. tech companies relied on a steady stream of engineers and software developers from china and india and elsewhere. meagan soszynski is the head of hr for an advertising app called yieldmo. over dessert, soszynski says getting what's known as an h-1b visa for those high-skilled workers was often slow and expensive, but at least it was predictable.

clinton: and what i believe with all my heart is that what's happening here can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. we are builders, and we need to get back to building.

the first pandemic story that i filed was a news report for morning edition on the effect that venue and festival cancelations would have on the jazz economy; it featured an interview with british saxophonist shabaka hutchings, whose band shabaka and the ancestors had been ramping up for a major tour. that story broadcast on march 19, the same day npr music published a piece i wrote about aaron parks and his tentative decision to proceed with a new album announcement. (his lead single was solace, an apt offering, though he could also have gone with is anything okay?) the album-release engagement for his little big ii: dreams of a mechanical man was then still scheduled for the middle of may — and it's unclear whether clubs in new york will be back in business again, i wrote. my assessment turned out to be a lot less perceptive than one articulated by parks.

in earlier days, sallenave says, each city had a local team to oversee uber operations and drivers might have the cell number of the general manager. but once uber centralized its system, in an effort to aggressively scale up, we were so focused on the rocket ship of growth that corporate leaders let communication systems fall apart.
that hurts the sickest people the most, says linda blumberg, a senior fellow in health policy at the urban institute. a study by her organization shows health care has become more affordable since the affordable care act was implemented two years ago. still, the research found, about 17 percent of adults in the u.s. continue to struggle to pay their medical bills.
i could see that gilead would like that, kaitin said of the orphan drug tax breaks and promise of seven years without generic competitors. but at the same time, it's hard to imagine the fda would say, ok, we're going to call it an orphan drug even though it's not [rare.]' 
the (oig) report vindicates what dhs has long been saying: for more than a decade it was and continues to be standard for apprehended minors to be separated when the adult is not the parent or legal guardian or the child's safety is at risk, said dhs spokesperson katie waldman. for the hhs oig to claim it was not known that dhs is actively enforcing this policy in the same manner for more than a decade ... casts doubt on the hhs oig's credibility on this topic.

demby: that sounds like one william jefferson clinton.
that why it's being left out, because it's seen as too controversial right now. the last thing trump wants is to have the narrative hijacked and turned into how he's proposing to increase the cost of everyone's avocados.
but democrats say there's nothing bipartisan about the bill, which was negotiated without their input.
that set off a new round of controversy. but as polls have shown hillary clinton with a consistent lead post-convention, his new campaign team has urged a change in tone, if not policy. gone is trump's idea of a deportation force, which he proposed in november last year. he later told nbc's chuck todd on meet the press that children born in the u.s. to illegal immigrants would have to be sent back with their families to their parents' countries of origin.
she also faults trump for using pentagon money to build his wall on the border with mexico. such action, eaglen says, sets up the budget to be raided by any future president for any self-declared 'emergency.'

elliott: ahmed is 38 years old and had been in good health. now he's in single-room isolation at home. he's been using technology to connect remotely with family around the world and his colleagues at uab. because of a lack of widespread testing, he says there's no way to pinpoint how he became infected.
donors understand that that contribution is much more critical to the success of the campaign, weaver said. and you know, that feeling is justified, because it's exactly right. when you only rely on small donors, every one of those $27 [contributions] is critically important.

with immigration discussions foundering on capitol hill, we wondered what the people on the frontlines of implementing those policies think. chris cabrera is a spokesperson for the national border patrol council, the union that represents the nation's almost 20,000 border patrol agents. he joins us on the line from his office in mcallen, texas, on the border. welcome to the program.
people weren't crossing through treacherous terrain like the terrain they currently are until the 2000s, she tells here & now's robin young. in the mid-'90s, border patrol changed its enforcement policy to build up enforcement in the easy-to-cross areas and funnel people into the harsh, desolate desert terrain.
faulty facial-recognition tools have led to wrongful arrests of black men and an ongoing lawsuit in new jersey.
so what we have seen is very interesting. there seems to be an incentive on the saudi side and others to reach out to the iranians in new mediation efforts. but i think of all the regional players, the israelis are in best position to defend themselves should they be a target of retaliation. but, of course, the iranians are signaling they don't distinguish between the united states and israel, so i don't think there is a lot of complacency in the region that this is over.

health insurers, which are threatening to pull out of exchanges in some states, aren't the main concern in massachusetts. gutierrez says he is hearing very little from the state's mature and stable market. most plans that sell insurance through the health connector are nonprofits based in the state. and they may have less reason to worry that healthy members will flee, leaving insurers to cover the high costs of ill members. massachusetts residents would still be required to buy insurance, by state law, even if the aca mandate is repealed.

and i think what would be much more effective at keeping the most people safe is releasing as many people as possible from incarceration. prosecutors can start to decline seeking detention on the front end. courts can decline to detain people or can release people. sheriffs and other people overseeing jails can start to advocate for the release of the people inside facilities. parole commissions and governors can start to release people as well. a lot of people are held on parole or probation violations or could be granted early release through other means.

unlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, mr. trump knows when to walk away. roger ailes and fox news think they can toy with him, but mr. trump doesn't play games. there have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including drudge, slate, time magazine, and many others, mr. trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity.

after 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they ever have, trump said at a joint briefing at the white house with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. my vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides — a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of palestinian statehood to israel's security.

hook: i think he has it incorrect. the united states doesn't have any permanent enemies. and you look at the trajectory of both japan and germany after world war ii as an obvious proof of that. the united states stands and supports the iranian people. i think they would like to have better relations with the united states. we would like that as well. but this regime stands in the way of that in terms of just having much better relations with the united states and behaving like a normal country.
mcammon: that's your hope that this reestablishes deterrence. but iran is talking about targeting american personnel everywhere and anywhere. what are the chances this backfires?
csr is arguably at the very core of american apparel's business model. the company produces its products in the u.s. and offers competitive pay and benefits. studies of millennials' preference for buying local indicate that such a sweatshop-free model should be attractive and successful in commanding a premium. faced with the reality of the world after the great recession and stuck with its ethical sourcing strategy, though, american apparel wasn't able to cut costs as aggressively as competitors did and has failed to make a profit since 2009. the company has also heavily relied on a sex sells approach to marketing, something that often overshadowed any ethical positioning the company tried to assume.

garcia-navarro: what about border patrol agents? brandon judd, the president of the national border patrol council, of which you belong, complained just this past week on capitol hill that the president has only proposed and congress is slated on funding 500 new agents this year. at this rate, the agents we hire this year will be halfway to retirement before we meet the goal in 2028. are you satisfied with the amount of support you're getting for hiring more agents?

geisinger spokesperson wendy wilson says that what the company plans is very different from direct-to-consumer services like 23andme — which tests customers' saliva to determine their genetic risk for several diseases and traits, only some of which are medically actionable, and makes the results available in an online report.

for the past four decades, it's been generally off-limits for u.s. ambassadors to invite taiwanese officials into embassies. ever since the united states switched diplomatic recognition to beijing from taipei in 1979, america's relations with the government in taiwan have been unofficial. to keep it that way, a complex and ever-changing set of rules has guided how executive branch officials should deal with the taiwanese.

tabler: well, it's a good question. it's only a cessation of hostility, so the war, including russian airstrikes, continue. that's the strange part. also isis still controls about 50 percent of syrian territory.
horsley: the white house says they're still exploring all of their legal options, which include going back to the full 9th circuit and asking them to review the decision made by that three-judge panel last week. the white house could also appeal to the u.s. supreme court. what is clear is the administration is still chafing at having its decisions, its policies questioned by federal judges. over the weekend, the president tweeted about what he called a court breakdown, saying it's allowing refugees to keep entering the country. and white house adviser stephen miller made the president's case on nbc's meet the press.

nteta: if we really want to drill down - and to be fair, we don't have the specific answer to your question with our data - but if you really want to drill down, i think that's what's going on here is that there's a long history in political science of whites, when faced with policies in which african-americans are the beneficiaries or african-americans are the targets, their negative views of african-americans tend to be a good measure of understanding their opposition to these particular policies.

among the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the united states through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. the ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, ocasio-cortez's office told npr, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.

newark, throughout all time, had been a city where kids walked to school. there were many small neighborhood schools, and there was no bus system that took kids to school, except in the case of kids with special needs who had to go to special schools. but the average child in newark just walked to a neighborhood school. and the feeling that she had - and this is a strong feeling in the reform movement - is that children and families should have choice. they should be able to choose to leave a failing neighborhood school if they want to.

the other chefs have experienced similar success: sunuwar's momo (nepalase dumplings) and samosas, which she makes fresh to order, sell like hotcakes. one frequent customer comes in almost daily for vegetarian chow mein, often asking her about nepal and when she's going to open her own restaurant.

then there's trump's tax plan. he would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and wall street money managers. that would explode our national debt and lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection.
hall: (as lisa conroy) this is a mainstream place, you know? and it's a family place, which means a lot of families come here. and it also means that we're all family. and yeah. you're not - you know, you're not wearing a whole lot of clothes. but trust me. if these guys wanted to go to a strip club, they know where to find them. they just come here so some sweet girls can take good care of them.

joe biden: and it's not hard to see that we're in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis with a once-in-several-generations public health crisis. a crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight. and there's no time to waste. we have to act, and we have to act now.
so as mcmaster, defense secretary james mattis and other leaders plot the aggressive new approach for isis that trump wants, they have room to run that their predecessors did not. that could mean more weapons, more special operations troops closer to the fight against isis, reduced safeguards for civilians or other revisions to the current rules of engagement.

odenkirk: (as jimmy mcgill) it's a discrepancy. absolutely. but typically when that happens, the police look at the treasurer. and since that person is - i just think a little proactivity may be in order.
natapoff: no, i'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. we need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. it's not ok to take other people's stuff. it's not ok to engage in low-level violence. it's not ok to drive drunk. and so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.
reeeves: oh, it had a pretty impressive collection, items not just of importance to latin america but globally, a huge range of things, you know, from the world of art, zoology, anthropology. there was a collection of egyptian mummies. there were greek and roman treasures collected by emperors over the ages. there were insects gathered by jungle explorers and dinosaur bones and paintings and photographs. and there was luzia. that's the nickname given to the skeleton - the remains of a woman who was found in a cave in brazil in the 1970s. she's an estimated 11,500 years old, and that makes her one of the oldest human skeletons ever found in the americas.
people with als often must quit their jobs — and sometimes their spouses do, too, to provide care — leaving families in financial distress. a decade-long campaign by advocates highlighting this predicament notched a victory last month when congress passed a bill opening key support programs earlier for als patients.
it's a privilege to serve with all of you. i mean it. many of you have reached out in the last few days with your concern and your prayers, and it means a lot to me. it really does. i've had so many people say such nice things about me recently that i think some of you must have me confused with someone else. i appreciate it though, every word, even if much of it isn't deserved.
the lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. so there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.

the study finds one of the biggest bites to a country's budget results from the link between child marriage and population growth. the report estimates that a girl marrying at 13 will have an average of 26 percent more children over her lifetime than if she were married at 18 or older. and across the countries studied, ending child marriage would reduce total fertility rates by an average of 11 percent. take niger, where more than three-fourths of women are married before age 18 — the highest proportion in the world. the study finds that ending child marriage would slow population growth by 5 percent by 2030.

the bolsonaro government will withdraw from the global compact on migration being launched in marrakech, an inadequate instrument for dealing with the problem, tweeted ernesto araújo, now the country's foreign minister, in december. immigration must not be dealt with as a global issue, but rather in accord with each country's reality and sovereignty.

so i'm sort of trying to navigate what that's going to be for me. you know, i'm - you're taught to give your kids more, but in giving them more, like, what do they lose? and i think that's sort of was the conceit and premise of the show.

hinojosa: the last four years really has been a culmination of decades of really inaction by both the republicans and the democrats and, frankly, by an increased rhetoric around immigrants and immigration that couldn't be further from the truth. we have this narrative now that we are painted. if immigrants were, for example, invisible to a certain degree, now we are being targeted. now we are being seen as something that we are not. there is a narrative that this administration, the outgoing trump administration, has created. and so in many ways, you know, it comes down to communities. are you talking to the immigrants in your own community and making them understand that you don't see them as a threat, but rather you see them as part and parcel of who we are? so it's been a really challenging, ugly four years, but there is a possibility for people to now take this to heart and make changes.

the session, which was scheduled to last eight hours on wednesday, will continue for a further eight on thursday. this stage in the proceedings comes a day after the president's legal team rested in its defense of trump. democratic house managers made their case last week on why the president should be removed from office. trump was impeached last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress.

many of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. they were surrounded by dangerous situations. they often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. so i represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. and yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. it was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.
the move came a day after congress approved a spending bill giving trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, far short of the $5.7 billion he had called for. trump signed the bill friday afternoon, averting another government shutdown until at least october. invoking emergency powers frees up additional funding.

open enrollment this fall (for 2018 health insurance coverage) would shorten to six weeks, down from three months. while opening day would remain the same — nov. 1 — the final rule closes the marketplace on dec. 15 instead of at the end of january. that period provides sufficient time for consumers to enroll, the administration has said, and would mean all who sign up would have a full year of coverage starting jan. 1.

it is important to note that trump's plan would have a steep uphill battle to get through this congress. still, not surprisingly, there is also debate around how trump's drastic proposal will affect blue-collar wages moving forward. the trump administration hopes the plan will free up future jobs for american low-wage workers. but mark zandi, moody's chief economist, who has advised john mccain and donated to mccain and hillary clinton's campaigns, told politico the plan is a mistake that will cause the labor force to come to a standstill in the next decade. it is hard to imagine a policy that would do more damage to long-term economic growth, he said.

but several states, including new jersey and texas, are starting up mega-sites — vaccination clinics designed to vaccinate hundreds or thousands of people each day. more of these venues will likely crop up across the country as federal funding allows health officials to hire temporary staff and pay for space and supplies, and as soon as the supply of vaccine is steady enough to keep these clinics stocked at full volume.
the president's unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our constitution and makes america less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation. ... the president's actions clearly violate the congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our founders enshrined in the constitution. the congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.

keith: clinton delivered his speech at a company called futuramic tool and engineering. trump talks about bringing back the steel mills, many of which have been shuttered for more than a generation, while clinton emphasizes advanced manufacturing, a growing sector in the u.s. economy. futuramic, she said, had faced a choice as the auto industry's struggle started hurting its business and it chose to adjust into aerospace.
our criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. we need it to go after dangerous people. we need it for deterrence and for public safety. and yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.

even though the pre-authorization studies of the pfizer and moderna vaccines were as streamlined as possible, they still required quite a lot of work. each of the 75,000 volunteers had to come into a clinic; get a test for the coronavirus; get either a vaccine or a placebo shot (without knowing which they'd received); return for a second shot; and come back to the clinic for testing anytime in the interim if they showed any symptoms of having caught the virus.

and that was something that i think was very risky diplomatically and probably had a very powerful impact on his ability to run the u.n. after that. it really set him up against, you know, a conservative administration that, i think, held that against him for years and used that as a kind of lever later to try him for some - i mean, among some conservatives in congress, to try and push him out of the job.

white house officials say the $8 billion should allow trump to build as much wall as he wanted to — 234 miles of barrier — had congress authorized the $5.7 billion he asked for. officials say plans are to construct a metal bollard barrier, not a concrete wall, at locations to be determined by customs and border protection.

today, lieutenant colonel alexander vindman was escorted out of the white house where he has dutifully served his country and his president. he does so having spoken publicly once, and only pursuant to a subpoena from the united states congress. there is no question in the mind of any american why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the white house. ltc vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. his honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful. during his decades of service to this country, ltc alexander vindman has served quietly but dutifully, and he has served with honor. he came into the public eye only when subpoenaed to testify before congress, and he did what the law demanded. in recent months, many entrusted with power in our political system have cowered out of fear. and, yet, a handful of men and women, not endowed with prestige or power, but equipped only with a sense of right borne out of years of quiet service to their country made different choices. they courageously chose to honor their duty with integrity, to trust the truth, and to put their faith in country ahead of fear. and they have paid a price. the truth has cost ltc alexander vindman his job, his career, and his privacy.

garcia-navarro: what are the next steps though? for example, former cardinal theodore mccarrick was defrocked earlier this month. in fact, you were instrumental in that decision. victims want zero tolerance and that all priests who are found guilty have the same thing happen. will it?
sullivan: capacete said he says he learned some brokers were pushing puerto rican clients who had already put so much of their retirement or savings into the special funds to go borrow money and put it into the funds, too. it's like using poker chips to take out a loan for more poker chips and betting them all on the same hand.

detrow: the sun is hitting the washington monument now. and it's creeping its way eastward toward the u.s. capitol. and when it gets here, what it's going to see is a very different looking inaugural platform. you have the flags draping the front of the capitol, the original 13-star flag, you know, other flags throughout american history. you have the bunting. you have the military band. they just brought out the big, comfortable armchairs where the president and vice president are going to be sitting before they're sworn in.
simon: steven groves, special assistant to the president, deputy press secretary. thank you for being with us.
california wasn't supposed to be close. in early polling, hillary clinton had a commanding lead, but that lead has all but vanished. a new survey from the public policy institute of california has clinton in a virtual tie with bernie sanders among democratic primary likely voters — 46 percent support clinton while 44 percent support sanders.
[trump said welfare use will decrease when he's president. but it is a myth that immigrants in the u.s. illegally qualify for those subsidies. as cnn noted in 2014: undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps, medicaid, and most other public benefits. most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status and under the 1996 welfare law, even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the united states for more than five years. still, some households of immigrants in the u.s. illegally do receive some form of subsidies because of children born in the u.s. who qualify. a right-leaning immigration think tank did an analysis showing immigrant households receive more on average than nonimmigrant households that also receive benefits. but that study has been criticized as fatally flawed. — domenico montanaro]

inskeep: which means that if you are president biden, you need 10 republicans, minimum, to pass ordinary legislation because it's gotten to the point where they routinely move to invoke cloture to cut off debate. you need to get up to 60 votes out of 100, a supermajority, and if you don't do that, you don't get anything done.

the department of health and human services is eliminating the requirement that physicians obtain a special federal waiver in order to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication to treat opioid use disorder. previously, doctors had to take an eight-hour course to receive the license, called the x-waiver.
and i think that that will help set an example for other states that they can enact increased minimum wages and it doesn't devastate the economy. it helps those economies be stronger. but i suppose in that sense that you certainly can't make a patchwork argument against california or new york. but i would say that, again, that sort of argument that you have to have uniform rules across every state no matter what city you're in is just belied by experience. one of the reasons why different people live in different cities is in part because of the different cultures of those cities or the different maybe protections of those cities. maybe they've got better zoning rules. maybe they have a more thoughtful urban planning process.
both tech companies cited the upcoming inauguration of president-elect joe biden as a reason for taking more stringent approaches to stamp out misinformation campaigns.

neither barclays nor any of the other banks would agree to an interview. in statements, banks said they fully disclosed their financial stake in the deal and did not influence how puerto rico used the money. morgan stanley said they also extended puerto rico $250 million in credit after the bond. it was difficult to find bank insiders to talk on the record about this. and then i found one former broker who would.
kenyon: at stake is a deal designed to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least a decade. rockwood says most of iran's violations can still be reversed fairly easily. what would really set alarm bells ringing would be a move to stop allowing the inspectors to see what's going on at iran's nuclear sites.
as someone who has served on your trust and safety board since its inception and counseled you since 2009, time is now to suspend president trump's account, said danielle citron, a law professor at the university of virginia, in a tweet. he has deliberately incited violence, causing mayhem with his lies and threats.
is a country like china different, and is it more likely that they are — cheating isn't necessarily the right word, but — doing more of these kinds of things that are more worrisome than other countries? said chad bown, senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics. and i think the answer to that is probably yes.

every president tries to burnish his legacy by highlighting perceived successes in the final days, said alex conant, a republican strategist who worked on republican sen. marco rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. trump's problem among many is that this trip will be completely overshadowed by the fallout from last week.

nationwide, hospitals are struggling to provide services to people with psychiatric emergencies. between 2006 and 2013, er visits increased by more than 50 percent for psychoses and bipolar disorders and depression, anxiety and stress reactions according to the healthcare cost and utilization project, which compiles health care data. between those years the number of visits climbed from 3,448 visits to 5,330 per 100,000 u.s. patients ages 15 and older.

you had a rude awakening one night, right?
sagal: jeffrey, you're so delighted by that. it's adorable.
detrow: yeah. biden raised some other criticisms. and this is something his campaign has raised a bit. and we also saw hillary clinton use this a lot against sanders in 2016. it's the fact that as a congressman in the 1990s, bernie sanders voted against several gun control measures, particularly - multiple times - the brady bill, which established background checks. sanders' response was that he supported assault weapons bans all along - going back to his first run for congress, voted for one during that period - and that, for the record, he says he was representing the views of his rural state at the time but that gun violence has gotten a lot worse since then and his views have changed.
my opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve american children. and that's what she's doing. and that's what's she's done. we will repeal and replace disastrous obamacare.
the move to expand eligibility to over 65-year-olds by trump administration officials seems well-intentioned, but it is incredibly confusing to the public and disruptive to those trying to implement these programs to keep switching up eligibility every few days, noted dr. kelly moore, deputy director of the nonprofit advocacy group the immunization action coalition and a former immunization manager in tennessee.

that would bring some manufacturing production back to the u.s., said gordon hanson, who co-wrote that study on u.s. jobs moving to china. but that's not the same thing as manufacturing employment. the jobs that left were 20th century jobs. that is, they were jobs in factories that were built using older vintage technology that was more labor intensive than 21st century tech in which automation is more present.

how many levels can you count in the ryan-trump chess game?
for most people it was the combination of needing a son, wanting a son, and also the fact that they already had so many children. i have to say, it was surprising, because in the u.s. we hear one-child policy, we think, oh, there's just one child that the families kept. but i don't think i met any families with one child. they all had like three, four, five, six, seven or even eight children, and there was a pattern in that most of the children of higher birth order were female and then they would keep having children until they had a son. and so the missing daughter was usually not the first daughter. they would usually keep that one. the missing daughter was usually the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc.

when i went back to vietnam in 2004, for the second time, i finally was able to meet her. and she'd been a presence in my life because i remember, you know, we had a photograph of her when she was probably 16 - black-and-white photograph. and she was beautiful. and when i was growing up, i was always haunted by that face, her face, and thinking, why is she there and not here? i have no memory of her, but her memory obviously persists in the family.

workers really need to have employers follow the basic cdc guidance of social distancing, masks, notification when there are cases. and also they need to be able to speak up when they know that there are unsafe conditions and not be retaliated against. the bottom line, i think what you find out in this pandemic and the public should realize is worker-safety rights right now are really weak. and maybe this pandemic will cause us to rethink this ability of workers to protect themselves, which right now they really don't have.

russakoff: you know, the main thing that i am struck by was just by witnessing what this particular charter school was able to do with the extra resources that came into the building and the classroom. the principal of the charter school, who is very proud of their student results because they - you know, they do far outperform the school district - said unequivocally she never would have these results if she didn't have these extra resources. in other words, if she only had the resources to work with that the school district schools had, she couldn't have done this, and her students couldn't have done this. so to me, the biggest takeaway - and again, as i said, it's a huge political enterprise that can't be done easily - but it's to figure out how to get resources to individual schools within school districts to meet the needs of children because they really don't have the resources to meet them now in cities like newark.

it was a country that was corrupted by american aid, and people brought those habits of corruption and brutal competition with them to the u.s. and they also brought the memories of vietnamese people killing other vietnamese people to the united states. and i'm sure that affected them and their children and created the conditions for violence and brutality towards each other in this - the very same community, as you said, that was created in order to protect each other.

it was in the range of 70 to 80 percent in favor for paid sick, for increased minimum wage, for having this predictive scheduling and for having expanded paternity and family leave. and so what you have is a situation in which these are popular policies, the people want them, and now we have evidence that even - many businesses want them and support them. but you have a pretty narrow - a set of people who are actively arguing against them and using, i think, some deeply flawed studies to try to oppose these really popular and good policies.
nine days after the state of the union speech, congress approved a bipartisan spending bill that gave trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, short of the $5.7 billion he had asked for. trump signed the bill to avoid a partial government shutdown but moved to declare a national emergency in order to free up military construction funding for the wall along the u.s.-mexico border.

elving: that is a particularly stunning statement given that mitch mcconnell is still the republican leader even after the majority changes hands. he is still representing 50 votes in the senate. and also, he is going to be a juror. all 100 senators act as jurors in an impeachment trial. and we remember that the first time the president was impeached, mitch mcconnell was a highly effective organizer. he was not defending the president as one of his lawyers. but he was a highly effective organizer of the republican vote against conviction, to support president trump. and to have him pull that away in such explicit terms now is, at the very least, a green light to all republican senators to follow their conscience, not to follow necessarily party or their vote in the first impeachment trial.

democrats impeached trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of congress for what the prosecution team says was a campaign to pressure ukraine into opening investigations into trump's political rivals by holding up $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance in order to apply leverage on ukrainian authorities. house democrats say the white house's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment investigation is proof of a cover-up and amounts to obstruction.

thank you, i love you, thank you, god bless you, everybody!

nguyen: well, rice. i remember that we had just - my dad had built these racks and racks that were just stocked full of rice up into the rafters. and i remember going there after school and hiding up in these rafters amid these sacks of rice and all kind of, you know, vietnamese fruits and things like fish sauce - nuoc mam, which is the lifeblood of vietnamese cuisine. and there was always a certain kind of odor in the vietnamese grocery store that i came to recognize, which was the scent of rice and fruit and spices that you cannot find anywhere else - a certain kind of mustiness, which i assume might have been alien to americans but to vietnamese people was the smell of comfort.
president-elect donald trump has repeatedly cast doubt on assertions that russia was responsible for hacks and leaks during the election. but shortly after 6:00 pm on thursday, his transition team released the following statement, attributed to trump:
a former employee is suing the company for allegedly discriminating against white and asian male applicants as it tries to boost the number of black, latino and female staffers.
in an interview on friday with all things considered co-host mary louise kelly, secretary of state mike pompeo took questions about u.s. policy in iran and about the former u.s. ambassador to ukraine, marie yovanovitch.
keith: right. according to factbase, which is a site that tracks him, by the time trump's account was suspended, nearly 500 of his tweets had been flagged by twitter, mostly related to election misinformation. and that came after four years of riling up his supporters to hate democrats, the media, anyone who wasn't loyal to him. remember; there were those modified videos that he tweeted of him wrestling the cnn logo or shooting up a room full of his opponents. you know, all of that rhetoric reached a boiling point wednesday when pro-trump supporters stormed the capitol. his account was locked wednesday, and twitter warned that it would be suspended if he further broke the rules. but then he tweeted again yesterday once it was unlocked. and what he tweeted was that those who voted for him will continue to have a voice and that he would not be attending joe biden's inauguration. the company said those tweets are likely to further incite violence, so it made the suspension permanent.
martin: mary mccord is the legal director at the institute for constitutional advocacy and protection at georgetown university law center. she also served as acting assistant attorney general for national security at the u.s. department of justice. that was from 2016 to 2017.
if someone is found to be shedding the virus, then researchers will check to see if that virus is capable of reproducing itself and, if it is, whether there's enough to infect other people. that raises another unknown: it's not yet clear what an infectious dose would be.
she describes a wide-ranging effort that's already begun and includes scientific research on troops' exposure to blast during weapons training, enforcing limits on the firing of certain weapons, and even looking into whether special helmets could help stop blast waves.
i could see if he did not temper his remarks, whipping some activists up, walsh said. so i think we have to keep our eyes and ears very closely peeled on president trump.
the two outstanding cases come from california and washington state, in the 9th circuit's jurisdiction.
and the military is planning to use an updated version of the blast gauges in a major study of blast exposure that was ordered by congress late last year, lattimore says.
the administration is also urging states to expand vaccination to more venues, such as convention center mega-sites, pharmacies and community health centers.
stein: yeah, yeah. it's really fascinating. you know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this crispr gene-editing tool inside the retina. the crispr then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. here's eric pierce. he's the harvard doctor running this study.
banks: (as mike ehrmantraut) oh, gee, that's swell. and thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system. now, you'll either pay the $3, or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker.
in february 2004, he had been mayor of san francisco for about a month when he made a bold — some would say reckless — decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. for weeks on end, hundreds of couples from all over the state and nation lined up to get married.
but there is enormous interest and concern, among business executives who specialize in health benefits, in what a republican plan might look like. a post-election session on repeal and replacement aimed at these executives drew the biggest webinar audience ever for the national business group on health, said steve wojcik, the advocacy and research group's vice president of public policy.
wara added, what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. and it's hard to see that going on.
what u.s.-iran tensions mean for the middle east
and now i have no qualms about being sharp and satirical and highly opinionated and saying whatever's on my mind as quickly as i can and not worrying about that - i'm playing the same game. i know i'm not playing the same game. but it took me a little while to realize that the character was not in danger of re-emerging.
other notable takeaways of the survey include:
elving: his effect is on the conversation about issues and policy and the crisis, and we can see a lot of sanders' thinking in the big relief bill congress just passed - $2 trillion.
[trump is saying that he and pence will improve u.s. trade deals, but trade is just one of several areas on which they differ. pence has been a strong proponent of free trade in the past, having approved of nafta and the trans-pacific partnership, as the new york times reports. — danielle kurtzleben]

as the coronavirus spreads in the u.s., public health agencies are starting to worry about hospital capacity.
gross: i read your mother was in the cia. did you know...
the race for baltimore's next mayor was shaken up a year ago, following the death of freddie gray, the young black man fatally injured in police custody. after violent protests, current mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said she would not run again. now, well over a dozen candidates are competing, and because of the city's past voting record, the winner of this month's democratic primary will almost certainly become the next mayor.
it's 100 square miles in california, in the desert, where they built iraq. [the simulated iraqi village] was called medina wasl. the soldiers called it the suck. they were sent there for the last two weeks before deployment to really get their heads in the zone. there's tanks tipped over on fire. all the signs are in arabic. they had a humvee which was exploded five times a day on routine patrols with ied explosives. it was more and more disfigured as the demonstrations continued.
first of all, says lynch, wherever you choose to work, you need to be treated with dignity.
the outside world, at very least, does not appear likely to cooperate.
jeffrey: to throw out these general threats is inherently dangerous because if you become president, it's hard to back down on them.
torre: look, i kind of agree with him in that i don't think new yorkers really do care so much about the moralizing element of it. i think it's really funny, i think we love the fact that the daily news and the post are coming out with these all-time great back covers, but, honestly, it's what it says about the man, right? i mean like, i don't really care what his personal life is like, to be perfectly honest, in so far as he violates the pact he made with his wife, that's certainly a problem.
and this to me is the much bigger picture than russian interference in our election, bigger even than russian interference in the elections of others that has been going on for some time in europe and elsewhere. we see a real rise of autocracy around the globe everywhere from the philippines with duterte to turkey with erdogan, al-sisi in egypt the rise of the far right in hungary and poland. that challenge to liberal democracy is going unanswered by this administration. and we want to shed light on this.
rose: now, tens of thousands of families are hoping for similar reunions. legally, experts say it should be easy for president-elect biden to end the travel ban on day one as he's promised. the policy was created by executive order, and it can be reversed much the same way. but immigrant advocates say the hard work is still ahead.
because of doug collins being in the race initially, she had to go much farther right than i think she probably would have gone had he not been in the race, she said. i think we need to look at that going forward on what the impact of that was, and i think we still don't know.
but in a 2018 interview with npr, starr said this about the baylor scandal: unfortunately — and this is going to sound like an apologia, but it is the absolute truth — never was it brought to my attention that there were these issues. and i focused on student safety from day one.
elving: would not say taxes, no.

options may revert to health insurance plans as they were in new york before the aca.
inskeep: that leads to another question. we've been following the news from venezuela, where there are two competing presidents. and one key factor, as we have reported, is - who is in charge of the military? - whose orders the military will follow. the united states is nowhere near that level of chaos, but it's a tense political moment. have you asked questions of military leaders to be sure they know what rules to follow in the event of a crisis?
(c) in the case of an alleged act or practice prohibited by this title which occurs in a state, or political subdivision of a state, which has a state or local law prohibiting such act or practice and establishing or authorizing a state or local authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, no civil action may be brought under subsection (a) before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged act or practice has been given to the appropriate state or local authority by registered mail or in person, provided that the court may stay proceedings in such civil action pending the termination of state or local enforcement proceedings.
naughton: well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. at this point, we are only supporting democratic candidates, and although we want to see more republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team.
karen lloyd: the mysterious microbes living deep inside the earth — and how they could help humanity
simon: aw. we mentioned that you worked for president george w. bush, who advised john mccain. in your circle of friends, people there at the hoover institution - without violating any any confidences - your friends and colleagues - is your opinion widely held or are people who ordinarily would support the republican candidate talking about voting for hillary clinton?
some of the suggestions seem obvious, like promote a physically active environment or designate spaces for outdoor and indoor recess. but there's a point there. without a designated indoor space, for example, schools might just cancel recess when it's raining or snowing.
each of these jurisdictions is home to vibrant immigrant communities that also happen to include large numbers of undocumented people, says kristen clarke, president and executive director of the national lawyers' committee for civil rights under law, one of the legal groups representing san jose and the two counties. they too stand to lose a significant share of federal funding if alabama prevails in this case.
what are they going to be able to repeal without 60 votes? says robert l. laszewski, president of health policy and strategy associates. the 60-vote rule suddenly works to their disadvantage.
jones: look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. look at the people who've known joe biden for as long as they have. look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.
there was no hurricane or emergency, but they acted with a tremendous speed to call a special session in order to preempt that measure. and the lawmakers who were going to be considering that preemption bill received only about five minutes to look at the bill before they had to vote on it in committee. and the public was given only 30 minutes to speak out about that measure before that measure was put to a vote. and within nine hours, that bill was passed and signed into law.
u.s. officials estimate soleimani, his militia and their iraqi proxies are behind the deaths of scores of american service members during the war in iraq.
referencing the days after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, clinton recalled president george w. bush's visit to a muslim community center. to anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, that would not and should not stand in america.
brennan: my father was sort of - a lot of what he - i think a lot of his - the things he said were sort of stolen from, like, frank sinatra records.
nonetheless, the state department wanted to get its message out via an interview on npr. it's not the role of the media to reduce animosity or to increase it. instead, it should be npr's role to report with the goal of giving citizens the information they need to make informed choices. sometimes that requires pointed and repeated questions, whether or not the official being asked those questions likes it.

trump has denied any conspiracy to coordinate with russians to influence the election. he goes back and forth as to what he accepts about the active measures that moscow launched against the west, but he has been consistent in saying that the idea that his campaign had anything to do with those russian efforts is a hoax.
they should get some credit, some blame, said holtz-eakin.
as for trade, which has been a centerpiece of his economic agenda, trump reiterated calls for the u.s. to pull out of the trans pacific partnership trade deal and for nafta to be renegotiated. he said would appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for america, and he would apply tariffs on countries that cheat. economists have raised concerns in the past that such tariffs could lead to a trade war that would ultimately hurt american interests.
protections offered to immigrants under both daca and tps have been targeted to end under the trump administration, though federal courts have stepped in to extend both programs for now.
the clinton foundation recently announced changes that would take place if hillary clinton is elected president. bill clinton would step down from its board; the foundation would stop accepting foreign money; the clinton global initiative would end after next month.

detrow: and that's the closest he came to cursing, we should say.
kodjak: harper jean tobin, policy director at the national center for transgender equality, was also at that meeting.
inskeep: well, let's talk about that senate trial, which we expect to come within days. the impeachment paperwork has not formally been sent over to the senate and seems unlikely to be until a little bit later today, i guess, when democrats formally take control of the senate as new senators are sworn in. something quite dramatic happened yesterday that relates to that trial. and let's remember, of course, they're not going to throw the president out of office. he's already leaving. but it's possible that he could be barred from holding office again. and this is, of course, also the verdict of history.
my plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. there can be no prosperity without law and order.
rather than being a poster child for what the world is turning away from, we can now be a poster child for where the world is going, hughes said. the world is moving towards a lower carbon future, a lower carbon energy system, where the transition (is) from brown, polluting, fossil-fuel based energy systems, to green, non-polluting, clean, renewable energy systems.
there will be no change under hillary clinton – only four more years of obama. but we are going to look boldly into the future. we will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. american cars will travel the roads, american planes will connect our cities, and american ships will patrol the seas. american steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. we will put new american metal into the spine of this nation. it will be american hands that rebuild this country, and it will be american energy - mined from american sources - that powers this country. it will be american workers who are hired to do the job.
governments should not have downplayed the importance of face masks [as a protective measure for the public], says leiyu shi, who researches comparative health systems and health policy at johns hopkins university, because it will make them [seem] very foolish when they change their stance. again and again, shi says.
if you were a foreign power looking to weaken america, you couldn't do better than hillary clinton's economic agenda. nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. the one common feature of every hillary clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the united states. every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. and that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.
metal detectors and metal detecting wands are not currently in place on campus, but their use is being considered.
that poll asked these questions still other ways, though. for example, when the poll separated out different potential factors, several had strong support. fully 60 percent of americans said that ties to family members in the united states should be a factor in determining who should get to legally immigrate to the u.s. the poll also found that 57 percent believe education should be a factor, and that 54 percent believe professional or academic achievement should factor in.
just a week earlier, there seemed to be a shift in trump land. ever since the gop presidential front-runner hired political strategist paul manafort to helm his maligned delegate operation, the longtime republican hand has tried to telegraph the message that the controversial reality tv star would eventually evolve and tone down his temper and tenor on the campaign trail.
it has shrunk, grown and been reorganized several times. in its present form, the foundation is a constellation of nine different initiatives and two affiliated entities, each focused on achieving a different public policy goal.
inskeep: and let's just go to one more little bit of that brief bit of audio that we heard from senate majority leader - current majority leader mcconnell, because he said that they were provoked. the crowd that was fed lies - and it's mcconnell's word. the crowd that was fed lies was provoked by the president and by other powerful people. who is mcconnell understood to be talking about there?
already under suspicion for her web comments, saffold won't talk about her suit against the paper, but her lawyer brian spitz doesn't deny that she sometimes used the name lawmiss.
as a result of the syrian government's administrative process, scores of aid, like basic medical supplies, food and clothing, are seized by authorities or sitting unused in u.n. warehouses in syria and neighboring countries like jordan and turkey, says tom.
since then trump has praised the new rule announcement, but questioned whether those who don't stand for the anthem should be allowed to stay in the u.s.
you saw a kind of similar thing with the question of sanctuary cities, where gillespie was really hitting northam very hard on immigration and on kind of immigration and law enforcement. and the sort of the more liberal democrats in the virginia democratic party, which is quite a few of them, were dismissing these attacks outright. and northam was sort of willing to say, well, maybe, you know, if governor, i will do something about sanctuary cities - in a less punitive way.
the clinton foundation is where bill clinton focused his efforts after leaving office in 2001. initially formed to raise funds for and build clinton's presidential library, the foundation morphed into one of the world's most ambitious nonprofit organizations over the past 16 years.
texas attorney general ken paxton, who brought the lawsuit against the obama administration, said he agreed with the trump administration's decision.
making those changes would require the state of utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services. proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.

now, donald trump has a different view. he's made a career of stiffing small businesses from atlantic city to las vegas. there are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills. a lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. it wasn't because trump couldn't pay them, it was because he wouldn't pay them.

goldberg: one of the surprising things in these conversations was how fatalistic he is about the middle east, especially considering where he was when he started as president. you know, one of his big first speeches was a speech in cairo which was meant to reset relations with the muslim world. and he had a lot of hope for the peace process, he had a lot of hope for transition and during the arab spring - the first days of the arab spring. but he has come to the conclusion that there's nothing that the united states can do. nothing that would change systems in the middle east, nothing the united states can do that would make the middle east a better place. he believes it's a generational problem. he believes that the forces of fundamentalism and tribalism are so strong in the middle east that the u.s. would be foolish to try to shape that region.
most americans support legalization, angell wrote, and the federal government should at a minimum leave regulatory decisions to the states.

the education/race cleavages explain why the trump campaign is spending so much time and effort in ohio and pennsylvania — rust belt states where the white population is less educated than the country as a whole. because while clinton may have a single-digit edge with educated voters, trump has a double-digit advantage with white working-class voters. and in these states, the gop nominee has more room to grow because there's a larger pool of voters he can potentially energize.

parler is still seeking a way back onto the internet. the company promoted itself as a free-speech site. it attracted a mixture of republicans, self-identified conservatives, extremists and racists who found twitter and facebook too restrictive. numerous media reports revealed parler users explicitly calling for violence and then posting videos as they participated in last week's attack on the capitol. amazon and other services then cut ties with parler, which sued. so what is or was the company's responsibility? parler chief policy officer amy peikoff insists free expression was the goal.

roberta jacobson: i think one of the things that's most interesting that he will discover is that mexico has become, in some ways - and i don't want to overstate this - more and more like the united states in the migration issue in that it is not just a transit country anymore. it is, in fact, a receiving country. there are people from all over the world, but in particular from central america, who are coming to mexico and staying.
trump has made clear how he reveres the beleaguered steel industry, once saying that without one, you almost don't have much of a country.
want to know why the philippines president, rodrigo duterte, seems to hate the u.s. so much? the roots go back more than a century, but there's a more recent reason as well. for that, look no farther than the evergreen hotel in the southern city of davao, where duterte served as mayor for more than 20 years.

this is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while wall street is booming and declare, as sen. mccain did earlier this year, that we've made great economic progress under george bush, obama said at the time.
sagal: so president obama knew whoever he nominated wasn't going to get confirmed no matter what he did. we don't know why he just didn't mess with the senate - like, here's my dog, bo.
graves: i think that that - those claims have not been proven statistically. in philadelphia, you had a situation in which that mayor, you know, ultimately changed his mind - perhaps in view of his legacy. and after vetoing that paid sick measure at the local chamber of commerce there, he was ultimately convinced to allow this measure to go into effect and allow people to have paid sick leave. i think you have a situation where these measures are extremely popular and - in fact, in many employers, they're the norm, to have paid sick leave.

als, often called lou gehrig's disease after the new york yankees first baseman who died of the disease in 1941, destroys motor neurons, causing people to lose control of their limbs, their speech and, ultimately, their ability to breathe. it's usually fatal in two to five years, though about 10% of people survive ten years or more.
the mega-dam could both politically and economically transform the horn of africa. for some countries downstream, like sudan, it will provide cheaper electricity, and will help regulate the river's water levels, which are prone to yearly flooding. but sudan's support could potentially disrupt a 1959 treaty with egypt that allocates the nile's waters between the two countries.

for those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that i have outlined above. those who have left to seek entry under this new system, and it will be an efficient system, will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.
meanwhile, in 2008, huckabee had a far more commanding lead with these voters. he took 46 percent to romney's 19 percent — and they made up 60 percent of the electorate. all that added up to a solid 9-point win for huckabee over romney.

any new health law would need substantial revenue to replace the cadillac tax and the other aca taxes on health insurers, medical devices and high-income households that paid for care expansion — assuming those measures are repealed. otherwise, a replacement plan risks stranding the millions who are now getting government-subsidized obamacare coverage.
but it gets more complicated the longer ryan withholds his blessing for trump's nomination. the district went for ted cruz in the april 5 primary by 19 points, but since cruz dropped out and trump became the de facto nominee, fresh polling has shown 1st district republicans coming around. one poll found them split almost evenly between favorable and unfavorable feelings toward trump, and a clear majority wanted ryan to endorse him.

ana is in the middle of the long, expensive legal process of applying for permanent resident status, known informally as a green card. recently, the trump administration announced that it may tighten part of this process – the public charge assessment. the assessment scrutinizes how many government services a green card applicant currently uses — or might use later in life. if a person uses many government services, they could pose a net financial burden on the federal budget — or so goes the rationale. the government's algorithms are complex, but public charge is part of the determination for who gets a green card and who doesn't.

furman: i think both of those are great steps. the natural disaster doesn't just unlock 50 billion; it unlocks a set of rules that will make it much easier to deal with this. the house bill, i think, is terrific in terms of free testing; more money for state medicaid programs, which i think is really critical at a time like this when states will come under strain; and the paid leave, which is imperfect, but it's a compromise. it's a good start. so i think all of that is terrific, important, can't happen too quickly.

we recently donated the 500 metric tons of peanuts to haiti in partnership with the united nations world food programme (wfp) and in coordination with the haitian government. the donated peanuts will be used as morning snacks in usda/wfp school feeding programs in vulnerable areas of haiti where malnutrition is high. before donating the peanuts, usda worked with wfp to develop a distribution program to ensure that the donation would not negatively affect haiti's domestic peanut market. to prevent leakage of the product into the marketplace, the peanuts are in individual bags (28 grams apiece), they are to be consumed at school only, and we are designing a strong monitoring and evaluation program with the wfp to ensure the peanuts benefit the kids who need them. nearly a third of haitian children suffer from stunting, and many students arrive at school in the morning without having eaten breakfast. peanuts, as a traditional part of the haitian diet, provide much-needed protein. wfp is working with to us look at future needs and best uses for available peanuts.

so we believe that pay for play is very similar. if you just look at the percentage of african-american men in college basketball and college football, they far outdistance any other group. the picture in your head when you come to think about pay for play in terms of who will benefit if there's a change to the policy are going to be young african-american men. so for some whites, this is a subliminal connection. they're not aware. it's implicit. and for others, it's more explicit. they don't want african-americans to benefit financially in this sense, and they use those attitudes to sort of frame, or structure, their opinion on pay for play.

the same was true when we discussed a piece i reported about keith jarrett for the new york times, sharing the sad news that due to a series of strokes, he may never play the piano in public again. few jazz artists have ever had a more contentious relationship with critics than jarrett — i once saw him berate a colleague by name from the carnegie hall stage — while being the beneficiary of so much fawning coverage. i've reviewed jarrett in concert, both in solo piano mode and with the blue-chip trio he led for 30 years with bassist gary peacock and drummer jack dejohnette. whenever i did, i took pains to be evenhanded, assuring myself that a mixed or even tough assessment was justified by critical candor. but to hear jarrett talk about his creative output is to hear a man speaking about his whole self, his experience in the world (and in his head) up to that moment. i'm not sure i fully reckoned with the implications of that idea until we were on the phone lamenting the dimensions of what he'd lost.

no, of course not. of course, we don't want them to do those things. and we've raised the cost for doing this. the response in the previous administration when they undertook those actions was to reward them — to reward them, to give them billions of billions of dollars to allow countries to trade with them, to allow them to do all the things that you're seeing today, the ramifications, the tail, the end result of what the previous administration is the activity that we're seeing today. the money that underwrote hezbollah, that underwrites hamas, that underwrites shia militias in iraq is a direct result of the resources that were provided to them for the eight years prior to us coming into office. we are turning this around. we have reduced resources. we've seen it. they have fewer dollars available. this is beginning to place real choices in front of the iranian regime. and you can see it, too. you can see in the protests inside of iran. you can see the iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. all the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the american people are coming to fruition as a direct result of president trump's strategy.

cornish: and this is over the issue of contacts with russia in the trump campaign. but this is not the take that the administration had at the start of the day. so here's what press secretary sean spicer said in the morning on fox & friends.
nguyen: well, you know, she had to take care of the house, take care of the family business. and when the communists were already there, i mean, basically what they did was they seized the property, kicked her out. and then she was forced to join a volunteer youth brigade. and they were called volunteers - obviously they weren't - and sent to, you know, rebuild the country. so eventually, she came back from that. she found a husband, got married, had kids.

tabler: he did. and russia played a weak hand in - at least in terms of assad's domestic standing - very, very well. but the war in syria is far from over. i don't think the assad regime expected this. and it puts a lot of the military burden back on the assad regime and its allies to keep their head above water.

you only need to go back less than two decades ago to put, i think, the current cyber threat into its proper context. in 2001, our vulnerability was heightened because of the stovepipe approach of our intelligence and law enforcement communities that produced what they called silos of information. at the time, intelligence and law enforcement communities were identifying alarming activities that suggested that an attack was potentially coming to the united states. it was in the months prior to september 2001 when, according to then cia director george tenet, the system was blinking red. and here we are nearly two decades later, and i'm here to say the warning lights are blinking red again. today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.

gonyea: a lot of it is real concern about how he'd approach the peace process. so there's that. but there are all kinds of things. there are worries about religious intolerance on trump's part. prime minister netanyahu was among those who condemned trump's call for a ban on muslims entering the u.s.

even if they think that it's mostly about four years under trump, their assessment of the situation in u.s.-china relations has to have moved considerably, she says. they would like to stabilize things, but they probably have a pretty jaundiced view of where the u.s. wants to take all of this, even under biden.
khalid: you cannot overstate how frequently democrats bring this up. they want someone electable. but that word, electability, means different things to different people. some voters want a candidate who'll bring a more aspirational message. others, like geri frederiksen, want a politician who will punch back against donald trump.

[as we have pointed out in two earlier trump speech annotations, and as npr's chris arnold reported this year, it appears that nafta didn't have a huge effect on jobs. as the congressional research service reported in 2015, the agreement neither lived up to proponents' promises nor caused the massive job losses that opponents claimed it would. also, bill clinton was not solely responsible for nafta; it was negotiated under george h.w. bush before it became law under clinton. — danielle kurtzleben]
china is frustrated and bewildered that the u.s. does not organize its asia policy around relations with the region's preeminent power. instead, washington bases its policy on a series of cold war-era military alliances with smaller nations around china's periphery that beijing is convinced are designed to contain and thwart its ambitions.

tabler: no, it hasn't. russia's not necessarily stuck in syria. but i think this decision indicates that the - that in moscow there is considerable concern about the regime's lack of manpower and that the regime will not make concessions - political concessions - that can rebuild the country without facing the hard facts in the battlefield. and i think president putin has just delivered those hard facts back to president assad much more than he anticipated.
in june 1942, japan invaded and occupied kiska and attu, the westernmost islands of alaska's aleutian chain, an archipelago of 69 islands stretching some 1,200 miles across the north pacific ocean toward russia's kamchatka peninsula. from a strategic perspective, japan wanted to close what they perceived as america's back door to the far east. for thousands of years, the islands have been inhabited by a resourceful indigenous people called aleuts. during the russian-american period (1733 to 1867), when alaska was a colonial possession of russia, russian fur-seekers decimated aleut populations through warfare, disease, and slavery.

if investigators could establish that trump jr. spoke to trump as he was organizing the june 2016 meeting, it could suggest that trump jr. told his father that he'd received an offer of russian help for the campaign — and that would undercut trump's longtime denials that he knew nothing about the russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and damage clinton.

when he hosted a white house summit on combating violent extremism last year, president obama explained why he wouldn't use the term radical islamic terrorism to describe groups like the self-proclaimed islamic state or al-qaida. such groups, he said, did not represent islam, nor were their leaders religious leaders. we are not at war with islam, obama said. we are at war with people who have perverted islam.

bradford agrees that medical marijuana laws could have a role to play. but it is not without risks, he says. like any drug in our fda-approved pharmacopeia, it can be misused. there's no question about it. so i hope nobody reading our study will say 'oh, great, the answer to the opiate problem is just put cannabis in everybody's medicine chest and we are good to go.' we are certainly not saying that.
[here trump endorses the notion that people will be forced, or will choose to return home, and then get in line to come here legally. according to the state department, there are currently 1.3 million mexicans who are waiting in line for a visa. only a small fraction have any realistic hope of seeing a visa anytime soon. trump is talking about establishing new visa caps or limits under rules that haven't been determined. — richard gonzales]

trump sought investigations by ukraine's president including one into biden and his son hunter, who was paid by a ukrainian gas company at the same time biden was leading ukraine policy for the administration of president obama.
pletka: that's always going to be the case. anytime a hard call gets made, there are people who believe that it was the wrong call at the wrong time. and there are lots of arguments to be made that we should just ignore everything that's going on in the region, wait for it to come to the united states. you know, why not? after all, why shouldn't half a million people die in syria? why shouldn't hundreds of people die in iraq? why is that our business? my view is that these problems need to be dealt with before they become problems in new york, in la, in washington. it's a difference of perspective.
lynch: if you're a diplomat, you know, i mean, you shouldn't even be in the game if you're not somewhat optimistic because you always are sort of undertaking - particularly if you're a secretary-general, you know, you have limited power, right? and you have to convince countries that have real power to do things that they feel are not in their interest.
clinton still hasn't used that phrase, and has said it makes it sound like the u.s. is declaring war against a religion. clinton told npr monday that whether you call it 'radical jihadism' or 'radical islamism,' i think they mean the same thing. i'm happy to say either.

so the reason that that's important is, obviously, for things like promotion. but if you think about becoming a joint chief of staff or something like that, you can't have that job unless you have led troops in combat, unless you've been in combat, held combat roles and those types of things. even though the women that i'm serving with today have been [in combat], they [wouldn't] get credit for that in their record. so they could never rise to the level of a joint chief of staff.

so let's now talk about the big picture.
dionne: i can't resist. the, you know - and so that's striking. but i think the problem the trump people have is they cannot talk straight about russia. if jeff sessions had had a couple of meetings with the ambassador and hadn't gone out of his way to tell al franken on the committee in response to a question that didn't even ask him whether he had had any meetings that in fact he had had no meetings, this wouldn't be nearly as big a story.

so it's more subtle, this animus towards african-americans, but it's animus nonetheless. so they'll ask questions like the irish and the italians and jews faced discrimination but worked their way up to success. african-americans should do the same. and you agree, or you disagree? and so agreeing with that sentiment would be an indication of racial resentment.

mckinney: we're not exactly sure because we don't even know yet the exact number of hearings that have been canceled. we're waiting to hear about that. but, for example, in charlotte, n.c., that court is 100 percent non-detained, and therefore, it is completely shut down. hundreds of hearings have already been canceled, to be rescheduled once the government reopens. i imagine that most of them will be moved to 2020 because the 2019 docket is already full.

martin: to mark this day, we wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on president trump's first year in office, speaking to people on both sides of the aisle about the president's legacy and lasting imprint so far. earlier in the week, before the shutdown took effect, i spoke with two members of congress about the president's first year in office. we start with republican don young of alaska, the so-called dean of the house. that's a title reserved for the longest-serving representative. it's been 45 years in congressman young's case. we went to his office on capitol hill, and i asked him for his take on donald trump's first year.

and so from one newark onward, which started in the fall of 2013, no family automatically was sending a child to a neighborhood school. they had to go online and pick one of 60-something schools in the city - some charter, some district - and then algorithm would sort whether they got into that school. in theory, it's a great idea because everybody wants to be able to choose the right school for their kid, but it was a huge upheaval in the way people had always lived in newark. and at the same time, she was closing, consolidating and rearranging the district schools to make way for the charter school growth and to basically downsize the district, which already had lost a lot of kids to charter schools.

because you had a president that downplayed the virus, that downplayed the seriousness of the virus, that made up how you cure this virus, there's huge distrust now in the federal government and what they're advising. and so i do think that one of the first things the biden-harris team has to do is to launch a huge campaign to build the public's trust, but also to work with the states to develop better mechanisms to deliver this vaccine to essential workers.

speaking at a rally later monday afternoon in florida, hillary clinton didn't pass up the opportunity to criticize trump's economic speech. the democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 gop presidential nominee john mccain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while trump's could cost the country more than 3 million. she also accused trump of scrambling to do damage control by listing a new group of economic advisers.

trump's speech that followed was largely of the mold that many gop leaders worry is decidedly unpresidential. the mocking of ohio gov. kasich's eating habits was a staple. he again berated ted cruz, boasting that he has won evangelical voters this cycle while cruz holds up the bible, puts it down, and then he lies.

russakoff: well, it basically shows you that politicians do have their own agendas, and educational reform may be one of them, but other things can supersede. and i think it shows why this really has to be a process that is rooted in the community and has its strong advocates who aren't going anywhere, who are going to stay there and believe in it, year after year, and work for it. it's not something that's going to happen in five years or in, you know - within the term of a mayor or a governor. it's something that's going to take generations and has to be worked at continually.

insurance companies typically don't cover dna sequencing and do limit a patient's coverage for adult genetic tests for specific mutations, such as those related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes brca1 or brca2, unless the patient has a family history of the condition or other indications they're at high risk. for each of the patients it tests, geisinger will absorb the estimated $300 to $500 testing cost.

there are also going to be policy differences. blinken talks about the need to be at the table, while the trump administration left the iran nuclear deal, the paris climate accord and pulled funding from the world health organization. there is one thing that blinken said today that the trump administration got right, and that is getting tough on china. but he said the u.s. needs to counter china from a position of strength. and again, that means working with allies not, in his words, denigrating them.

[in 2012, president obama granted a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. upwards of 600,000 young people took advantage of that offer, which also made them eligible for work permits. in 2014, obama tried to expand his deportation reprieve to millions of additional immigrants, most of whom had children who are u.s. citizens or were green card holders. texas and other states challenged that action, and a federal judge in texas put the president's executive order on hold. that stay remains in place, after a shorthanded supreme court deadlocked 4-4 earlier this year. — scott horsley]

when acemoglu and robinson wrote why nations fail almost a decade ago, they used the united states as an institutional success story. they acknowledge the nation has a dark side: slavery, genocide of native americans, the civil war. but it's also a creature of the enlightenment, a place with free and fair elections and world-renowned universities; a haven for immigrants, new ideas and new business models; and a country responsive to social movements for greater equality. lucky for america — and its economy — its inclusive institutions have had a helluva run.

furman: yeah. i mean, the most important economic policy right now is to reduce the spread of this virus and to spread it out so that it's not overwhelming our hospital systems. testing has been a really important part of that in countries like south korea that have done a much better job than the united states have. so i'm glad that cost for individuals won't be an obstacle to testing. you need the actual tests, though. and that seems to be making some progress, but still way behind where we should be.

so it's a huge problem that insurance companies, i think, need to contend with across the country. there are all sorts of hidden additional costs with prescribing an opioid, and in the long run, it may be that using these nonopioid approaches, like physical therapy, and other medications, really provides the best improvement in chronic pain but also lowers costs.

since 1974, the trade adjustment assistance (taa) program has been helping workers who have lost their jobs due to trade policy. taa is sometimes called the cadillac of retraining programs. in one sense, workers who lose their jobs to trade are in a far better position than workers who lose their jobs to pretty much anything else: recession, bad management, whatever. because if they lose their jobs to trade they can qualify for taa and that means the government will help them find a job in an industry that isn't dying. taa will pay for school, relocation and job-seeking expenses, pretty much whatever it takes to help a former factory worker find a new job that won't be outsourced.

in regards to the state actions, russia has been the most aggressive foreign actor — no question. and they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy. in regards to the upcoming midterm elections, i think there may have been some confusion between what we are seeing now compared to what we saw in 2016. as the department of homeland security noted, we are not yet seeing the kind of electoral interference in specific states and voter databases that we experienced in 2016. however, we fully realize that we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself. therefore, and moreover, we are seeing aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and to spread propaganda focused on hot-button issues that are intended to exacerbate socio-political divisions. despite public statements by the kremlin to the contrary, we continue to see individuals affiliated with the st. petersburg-based internet research agency creating new social media accounts, masquerading as americans, and then using these accounts to draw attention to divisive issues. we have learned, just before this meeting, about the indictment of 12 russian military intelligence officials relative to their role in 2016.

kenyon: well, it has to no effect. i mean, quite the contrary, the europeans turned around and said, no, you need to get back in it. and now it looks like biden will get back in it. so this should be quite satisfying as a first step for the european allies. where that goes from there, of course, will depend on iran's reaction and what further steps are actually taken. getting back into the deal, as it was, is one thing. and that's what iran is saying it's willing to accept as a first step. and then it would seem new talks would be required, and then that could be a bumpy road indeed.

we talk about this backlog in generic terminology, but it's important to point out that to the department of justice and others that there's a kit sitting at a crime lab and waiting to be tested. and as we've been talking about, we know that many of these kits never make it to that stage, they sit in evidence rooms. so there's this education that needs to happen so that when someone, say a lawmaker is looking into the problem within their own state, want to know if they have an issue with a backlog, they can pick up the phone and call people and have them understand exactly what it is they're asking, we're not just asking, do you have kits that haven't been tested yet, do you have kits that have never made it to that page.

[that's true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the obama administration as he is for the other stats here. if he measured from 2008, the drop was $1,656. measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure's near-peak. [a broader point about all of these economic statistics: a lot of them have been true, but the question is whether obama is to blame. higher poverty, for example, doesn't appear to be obama's doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy. — danielle kurtzleben]

like, you can have a conversation in a cabin out in the woods, as clarence said. but what really needs to happen is that you interact with people who you are, like, trying to, like, live in community with. right? like, you need that to happen in a pta meeting or a community meeting, but those pta meetings don't exist because our schools are segregated. you know what i mean? there's no neighborhoods where people have to come up with rules around how to live with each other - not just talk to each other in these one-off conversations but, like, live with each other. right? so these dialogues feel like this diffuse thing that lives out in the ether. it's not tethered to how people are living day to day.

mcdonough says research universities in particular give their faculty wide latitude in setting up grad student work hours and schedules. he says losing that flexibility might jeopardize some kinds of research. he also says the process has become very politicized, and current labor board members are reconsidering this issue for political, instead of policy reasons. even if his side loses this decision, he says, it could always change back when the composition of the labor board changes again.

kenyon: well, tensions have been high for quite some time. there was an american contractor killed in iraq, and the u.s. went after the iran-backed militias they were holding responsible for that death. tensions continue to increase. militiamen at one point seemed like they were about to storm the u.s. embassy. then came this american drone strike. it killed soleimani and an iraqi militia deputy commander, among others. tehran then hit back with missile attacks on iraqi bases where u.s. military personnel were stationed - no casualties there. but iranian officials have been saying they're not finished. they've got more avenging to do for soleimani's killing.

patterson says enrollment numbers for 2017 are running 15 percent ahead of last year. but two things are clouding the future. first, the new trump administration and congressional republicans are vowing to undo obamacare.
on monday tc energy announced it would power pumping stations along the keystone xl with renewable electricity by 2030. it was an apparent bid to save the project as it was widely reported in canada that biden was preparing to withdraw a presidential permit needed to continue construction.

hurt: it's a contradiction, and it's a contradictory message that the president has been giving for weeks now. and i keep asking this of republican voters. what i'm hearing is, i still have to vote because what else can i do? and the candidates have been framing this as a message of if you want to keep fighting for the president, keep fighting by voting again. and we also should note that while the president is saying all of these things about the election system, he is telling people to vote too.
klobuchar and buttigieg sparred often during democratic debates, as both candidates strove to present themselves as the best pragmatist option not named joe biden.
you know, i happen to think we should be ambitious. while we're at it, let's connect every household to broadband by the year 2020. it's astonishing to me how many places in america not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don't have access to broadband. and that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the internet; 5 million of them live in homes without access to the internet. so you talk about an achievement gap, it starts right there. and let's build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well.

i think cubans in cuba will be terribly disheartened by the renewed restrictions, said carlos gutierrez, who served as commerce secretary under former president george w. bush. this decision will not play well anywhere, except for in those very cloistered spots in south florida where sen. rubio and mario diaz-balart have constituents.
the program has led to roughly 60,000 migrants getting sent back across the border since mpp was first implemented in january 2019. tens of thousands of people are still stuck in mexico, awaiting their court hearings, and living in unsanitary and potentially dangerous situations. the policy has placed enormous strain on mexico, even more so during the covid-19 pandemic.
delaware sen. tom carper said he's disappointed but not surprised by the report. during confirmation hearings on capitol hill last week, carper, who is the ranking democrat on the environment and public works committee, had asked acting epa administrator andrew wheeler if the epa could commit to establishing a maximum contaminant level for pfas within the next two years, and wheeler answered no.
white house officials have said the actions signed wednesday are just the first of many to come over the next several weeks.
elving: it's an enormous distraction in terms of public attention. something else is suddenly front and center, but it doesn't alter the impeachment process, which is in a state of suspended animation right now anyway. just yesterday, we heard the two leaders of the parties in the senate saying they had made no progress on a set of rules for the trial. so now, we have two crises in washington, and they may be on a collision course.

eyder peralta, byline: just outside the family health option kenya building in nairobi, there is a golden plaque. it says the headquarters for the reproductive-health organization was built with assistance from the u.s. agency for international development - or usaid. as executive director edward marienga sees it, the funding has been a blessing and a curse because when democrats enter the white house, they up funding. but when republicans take power, they reinstate the mexico city policy. when george w. bush took over after bill clinton, for example, the clinic was devastated.
northam: i'm telling the truth today. that was not my picture in the photo.
that would matter, of course, if ryan pursues a presidential campaign of his own in 2020 or beyond. ryan was mitt romney's running mate four years ago, at the tender age of 42. while he has said repeatedly he was not interested in running for president this year, he is widely regarded as a prospective candidate at some point in the future.
our economic policy, though, should be aiming to cushion the blow as much as possible. i don't - wouldn't go out and suggest that we hurt the economy for the sake of hurting the economy just to slow the spread of the virus. so we want to get relief to people. we want to get cash to small businesses to help them get through this. and we also need to be in a place where we're - want the economy to rebound as quickly as possible after this because the longer it goes on, the more people lose their jobs, the worse shape balance sheets are in for businesses. and you don't snap back very quickly when you're in a situation like that.
that means the trump administration was engaged in an aggressive and unannounced policy to separate families well before the issue exploded into the headlines in april 2018. that's when then-attorney general jeff sessions announced that all parents who crossed the border illegally would be prosecuted for immigration violations, and the government would take their children into custody. reports of wrenching scenes in border detention cells where uniformed agents pulled hysterically crying children away from parents sparked a public outcry that prompted the administration to abruptly discontinue the policy three months later in june.
greene: well, scott, is it worth noting when it comes to hard-line attitudes, specifically on deportations - i mean, there were a lot of critics who said president obama, i mean, had a hard-line attitude and deported a whole lot of people.
bolsonaro's government, now just over a week old, has drawn comparisons to the current u.s. administration, including in its rhetoric on refugees. on wednesday, the brazilian president echoed president trump's language comparing national security to home security.
it will certainly feel like a state of the union on tuesday night: the president will make a major speech to congress. a bit more than half the room will applaud resoundingly while a bit less than half sit on their hands in that familiar and awkward display of partisanship. members of congress will invite guests that telegraph pointed political messages, and the tv commentators will tell us who they are.

the nation's roughly 2.5 million agricultural laborers have been officially declared essential workers as the administration seeks to ensure that americans have food to eat and that u.s. grocery stores remain stocked. workers on the h-2a seasonal guest-worker program are about 10% of all farmworkers.
we're going to call on president-elect biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice, said saenz. we know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way.
redlener: yeah. i mean, this - the policy that may seem like the good idea, the right strategy when we're sitting around our, you know, conference tables - which we shouldn't be doing anyway right now - but when we do, we'll say, ok, well, we're going to close the schools in a particular community - which we may need to do in all communities. but the implications of such a, you know, announcement or new policy has tremendous hardship connected with it. and the same with the airports - if we have backups and backlogs of people waiting to get screened, that means we got a lot of people hanging around together, which is sort of the exact opposite of what we'd prefer people do in terms of separating from others and avoiding close contact.
trump's daughter ivanka and son-in-law jared kushner, who are observant jews, joined the president and his wife. the chief rabbi of the western wall, shmuel rabinovich and his wife yael, greeted them.

you use the word pressure. this is the maximum pressure campaign that president trump put into place a year and a half ago when he pulled out of the nuclear deal. but in that year and a half, iran has behaved more provocatively, not less. so is maximum pressure working?

because bloomberg suddenly enters this race and appears to be competitive in it, i really don't think that biden can win south carolina and suddenly win the nomination, bitecofer said. i think the party faces a real problem ... it's quite possible that sanders will become the nominee because the moderate flank is divided between two candidates.

one of the things that i'm very aware of, says gresser, is how immensely the food and restaurant business has changed during the 40 years that i've been involved in the industry — yet how little has changed for women during the same time. we need to expand the conversation about supporting women into leadership.
brooks: you know, robert putnam wrote a book called our kids. charles murray wrote a book called coming apart. it's about how the country is bifurcating along class and other lines. and we - a lot of us read those books and thought they were really important. but, at least in my case, i didn't make the connection to the presidential race as much as i should have. and the coming apart of the country and the segmentation of the country has affected both parties, and that's one of the reasons bernie sanders is doing so well - because he represents the disaffected people, or at least speaks about the disaffected people in the working class, as does donald trump. and hillary clinton, if you watch her and bernie sanders back-to-back, sanders just talks with so much authenticity and force, and clinton has not been able to match that. it's too much calculation and hesitation.

to all politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. there is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the american people. nothing even comes a close second. hillary clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. but she's not talking about the american families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. no, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. we will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity, so important. we will be fair, just and compassionate to all. but our greatest compassion must be for our american citizens.

[bill clinton did sign nafta, but it's misleading to attribute that policy entirely to him. in fact, it was negotiated under george h.w. bush, who signed it in 1992, as the washington post's fact checker has pointed out. after congress passed it, clinton then signed it into law in 1993. — danielle kurtzleben]
none of the criticism seemed to faze trump. he threatened a trade war with the country and floated the idea of seizing remittances from mexican immigrants in the u.s. to help pay for the wall. on cinco de mayo, trump took to twitter to show off that he was eating a taco bowl for lunch and wrote, the best taco bowls are made in trump tower grill. i love hispanics!

when a journalist asks an elected or appointed official for an interview, the goal is to get information that can be reported to the public. in this case, kelly wanted information about u.s. policy toward iran, including an issue that should be of vital importance to all: how the u.s. intends to keep iran from developing a nuclear weapon. she also had questions about pompeo's stewardship of the state department, and who is running u.s. foreign policy, which citizens have every right to know.

[his numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13.8 million, according to the labor department). however, this statistic alone is misleading. the number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since january 2009. it's true that the labor force participation rate — the share of americans in the labor force — is low in recent years. however, as of 2014, the congressional budget office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires. — danielle kurtzleben]

gross: well, you kind of work that out a little bit in your new novel because the main character, the spy, after the fall of saigon when he comes to the u.s., he ends up being an advisor on a film called the hamlet, that's very much modeled on apocalypse now. it's like your fictional version of apocalypse now. and in the acknowledgments for your book, you mention, like, a whole bunch of, like, books and movies that you, like, read or watched that have to do with apocalypse now. so your spy is, like, an advisor on this movie. what is expected of him?
dharia: absolutely. it's a huge concern. we have more than 3,000 jails around the country. having the constant churn of people coming in and out just exacerbates the problem and exposes everybody on the outside and on the inside. in florida alone, 2,000 people are admitted and released in county jails per day, according to the prison policy initiative.

khalid: when you ask democrats in iowa what's important to them, a lot of them mention the same few issues - health care, college affordability, the climate and the economy. in the huge field of potential presidential democratic candidates, there's a degree of nuance on these issues. but voters do not necessarily see major policy differences - at least not yet. and so what it comes down to for a lot of folks, like richard malloy from sioux city, is just somebody who can beat donald trump.

natapoff: so misdemeanors are minor offenses. every jurisdiction defines them differently. typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. but misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. sometimes we call them petty offenses. sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. in texas, gail atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. it was a criminal misdemeanor.
that said, all of those polls asked about building a wall specifically. but the definition of wall is fluid. while trump has long advocated for a border wall, he has also said that in some places on the border, natural barriers would take the place of that kind of barrier. and republican senators recently said that the wall would be more of a fence.
through such programs, consumers typically have owed nothing or have had modest monthly copays for pricey drugs, thanks to a financial contribution by the drugmaker that chips away at the consumer's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum limits until the health plan starts paying the whole tab.

then there's the estate tax, which trump wants to eliminate altogether. if you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the trump family $4 billion. but it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of americans. let me repeat that: the trump family gets a $4 billion tax cut... and 99.8 percent of americans get nothing.

there was broad concern among people with daca protections that trump would end the program, and january's executive orders didn't offer any clear signal about the program's future.
our community guidelines were clear that we would not knowingly tolerate criminal activity on the site. we were trying to avoid using a system in which we would scan every piece of content with an automated algorithm. and so what we had was a community jury system in which any person on parler could, of course, report a piece of content. we had a reporting mechanism. the report goes into a jury portal and we had a bunch of volunteer jurors who were adjudicating these cases. and then the verdicts would come down, the content would get removed as appropriate.

i wonder what they're thinking now as he leaves, as he goes off, truly, in ignominy, having been twice impeached, having had his own party leaders essentially leave him behind, having his vice president not attend his departure but instead choose to attend the inauguration of his rival. you have to wonder what those people are wondering about what they did and what the consequences of how blindly they followed president trump will ultimately be for them.

horowitz-ghazi: well, for thousands of years, the howl of coyotes could only be heard in their original habitat, the american southwest, where they were held in check by wolves and other predators and viewed by many of their native american neighbors as a deity. that changed with the arrival of european-american settlers in the early 1800s. coyotes and wolves took the opportunity to expand their diet to livestock. and for decades, the federal government actively encouraged the extermination of predators. that policy pushed wolves to the brink of extinction, but the wily coyote managed to thrive and spread pretty much everywhere. to this day, the government hires hunters to manage coyote populations and protect livestock in many states. and around 70 years ago, ranchers started to host coyote-hunting competitions.

but it was, ultimately, also a highly irregular kind of administration when it came to the means that the president used - the, in some cases, extralegal, as we're struggling with right now with respect to the incitement of that invasion of the capitol. it was irregular in a number of other ways - the way the president communicated, the degree to which the president relied on falsehoods, many every day, and selling them very hard to large rallies of people around the country. that was also something we have not seen in other presidential administrations, of all kinds, from both parties.
president trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. if the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. if you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that as well.
estrin: yeah. palestinians are eager to turn a new page here because trump has snubbed the palestinian leadership repeatedly. the administration closed down the palestinian envoy's office in washington. the trump administration moved the u.s. embassy here to jerusalem - where i am - and sided with israel's claims to the city. palestinians also have claims in jerusalem. so then, the palestinians cut ties with trump. and then, trump stopped giving humanitarian aid to palestinians. so there was just a lot of bad blood between them.

martin: before i let you go, i want to get your reaction to a story that broke in the washington post over the weekend. it reveals that president trump went to great lengths to conceal details of conversations he had with vladimir putin. that reportedly includes at least once taking the notes from his own interpreter and instructing that interpreter not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials. as someone with a long history in the state department, a veteran diplomat, would that be an unusual move?

the reason why he won't commit to follow their advice is because he knows what their advice is going to be and because if he were willing to do so, he would not have been nominated. that's a problem. we should demand better than that. you know it's astounding to me that the only two people apparently qualified to serve as acting attorney general or new attorney general are people who have already weighed in against the mueller investigation before they were even appointed or nominated. that just shows how low the bar is. i don't think we have to accept that i don't think we should accept that there are a great many very well qualified conservative lawyers who could be nominated for attorney general.
martin: so the reporting has it that you all, in that briefing, were outrightly discouraged from asking tough questions - that the tone in the room got a little tense when people tried to push. is that correct?

sagal: well, i think what you're trying to say is that president obama made the senate an offered that he didn't think they would refuse. so many republicans are on record praising the man. the white house played an audiotape of orrin hatch back in 2010 asking judge garland if he wanted to, quote, netflix and chill.
natapoff: i think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. one of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. and yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. and many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.

so i think that as cynical as we can be and sarcastic as we can be about, oh, here's another call for dialogue - i think it's still worth it. or at least it's better to call for dialogue than to call for something more problematic and divisive. that's the recipe some people have for a better america. i don't think it's going to work.
keith: well, after the ban last night, trump tried to get around it. he tweeted from the @potus account, then a campaign account, a campaign adviser's account. it was like whack-a-mole, and twitter took them all down. the white house then also sent the statement via the white house press pool, you know, like, the old-fashioned way. in it, trump complained of being silenced and said he and his supporters are negotiating with other sites and looking into building their own platform. i was listening to conservative talk radio on my way home from the white house last night. and mark levin, who is an ally of the president's, was encouraging everyone to delete twitter and facebook and move to parler, which is another platform with conservative backing and a lot less moderation. but that platform is now getting pressure from google and apple.

smith: absolutely. i mean, the president was trying - this crisis - they're coming for us. you heard his language. you know, we have an invasion, you know, coming at us, which was utter and complete nonsense. but when you engage the active-duty military, that drives up the debate because that's what we use - and the military is stopping an invasion. well, the military didn't stop anything. most of those people who went down to the border were sitting around playing cards because they didn't have anything to do because there was no invasion.
burnett: well, you know, this is ground zero of what the president considers the migrant crisis. i mean, you've got central americans who are waiting in all the major mexican border cities, but tijuana is where you really see them. you know, we started out with somewhere between, you know, 5,000, 6,000 migrants who'd come up in the caravan. the numbers are definitely down to perhaps 2,000, 3,000, even (inaudible) migrants now that are still here.
murphy: yeah. no, look, we have never had a reality-show president before. and you don't know if it's cyclical, and things will revert to mean, or this is the new normal. that - that's the open question that's going to get litigated. my guess is the future's a bit of a mix. i think there will be a rotation away from trump towards something a little more normal, a little more grown-up. but, you know, at this point, that's only a guess.

introduced by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york and sen. ed markey of massachusetts, the green new deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. the plan drew significant attention from president trump and republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. the green new deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.

in addition, the vatican has a whole another understanding of what accountability means in a case like this, because their theological model for understanding a bishop is not that he is the ceo of a corporation, but he's the father of a family. and as we would say with regular human families, you know, when things get tough, you don't tell the father to walk away. you tell him to, you know, try to solve the problem. that's their understanding of what accountability means.

the white house does have some options. trump's aggressive — if vague — rhetoric about the war against the islamic state has bought mcmaster a political rain shadow, at least at first. trump vowed to knock the hell out of 'em and step up operations in iraq and syria, without giving detail. he also has abandoned former president barack obama's onetime pretense that american forces weren't in combat, even after the deaths of troops in iraq and syria.
we're going to go back now to the questions of accountability and the way forward after the violence at the capitol wednesday. in recent years, far-right extremism has become increasingly visible and perhaps even accepted in some quarters in part because of president trump's own rhetoric or refusal to criticize it. so where do we go from here? we called mary mccord to help us think about that. she served as the acting assistant attorney general for national security at the department of justice. and she is currently the legal director at the institute for constitutional advocacy and protection at georgetown university law center, where she's been researching and writing about these issues.

it's not yet clear how president-elect donald trump and congressional republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the affordable care act or obamacare. they have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the senate to fully repeal the current statute. so they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. but they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.
brooks: but whether they're going to actually get these tax credit plan, which i think substantively is a good plan - i just think a guy who is offering a lot of security and order is not going to pass a health care bill that would increase a lot of risk for a lot of people.

khalid: buttigieg speaks for 10 to 15 minutes and then takes questions from the audience. a common question he's asked even among mostly white crowds is what he's going to do to gain more support from black voters. his basic response is that people need to get to know him better. but then he adds...

let's meet the man president trump turns to for advice on economic policy. his name is gary cohn and he's head of the president's national economic council. trump will be getting advice from cohn and that group today as he turns from health care reform to the next big item on his domestic agenda, a big overhaul of the tax code. gary cohn is a just-retired president of goldman sachs. those wall street roots, and also his moderate stances on social issues and trade, put him at odds with others in the president's inner circle. npr's chris arnold brings us this profile.
martin: ok, theresa - final thought from you, though, on this question. i mean, you heard what chuck said as a political, you know, player. his - you know, his argument - it isn't the policy, it's the politics. and that's kind of pretty much what you were saying as well. so how optimistic are you that if there are successes in this area, say, in - that president-elect biden says are priorities and that you think there's already consensus around - do you think that will create the political will around the sort of the broader changes that you would hope to see - rethinking the legal immigration framework, which is something that people say needs to happen?
kurtis: comfort turkeys, sugar gliders, snakes, spiders and more.
after graduating from high school, sunuwar was working at the commercial kaleidoscope kitchen with a fellow refugee named ibti salih, from sudan, when they met sabine langer. they didn't know it right away, but langer would soon change the course of their lives through a food hall she would launch called global café.

tuesday night schumer challenged trump to reopen the government while continuing to negotiate on border security.
colbert: you got me there. you got me there. why would i talk to the vice president of the united states unless he was making news?

trade deficits aren't inherently bad, but if the u.s. does want to sell more goods to china, the trump administration could try to negotiate china into being more open to u.s. products, says one expert.
sharp: well, it's completely wrong. for over 40 years now, congress and courts that have looked at title ix have all consistently said title ix was meant to combat sex discrimination. it's never been interpreted to include gender identity, and so the idea was always to ensure equal opportunities for men and women. importantly, title ix was specifically written to protect student privacy. it allows schools to have separate restrooms and locker rooms and dormitories on the basis of sex. so what the obama administration is doing here is essentially rewriting the law, ignoring congress, ignoring the normal process they're supposed to go through to force their agenda on schools across the country.
we turn now to alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. hillary clinton beat bernie sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. that suggests that it is joe biden's to lose. david greene talked with alabama's democratic senator, doug jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.

scott horsley, byline: the fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on wall street since the financial crisis. this was the first time the fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. and they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. they don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though fed chairman jerome powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.
gross: (laughter) so let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is viet thanh nguyen. and his novel, the sympathizer, won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
but for ryan, that's not the only level of the game. being speaker also makes ryan the protector of 247 republican seats in the current house, every last one of which will be on the ballot in november. if trump turns out to be a disaster — or even a middleweight burden for down ballot candidates — the gop could lose seats in swing districts. granted, there are precious few swing districts left, but even incumbents in slightly less-safe seats will worry.
in my administration, we will ensure that this system is in place — and i will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. we will have a proper tracking system. approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. why should they? nobody's telling them to leave. stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you. beyond violating our laws, visa overstays — and they really are a big problem — pose a substantial threat to national security. the 9/11 commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and september 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the u.s. on expired visas. and you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. wouldn't that have been wonderful? what that would have meant.

martin: president trump will be gone in a couple of weeks. he will be - he will no longer be serving in that position, whether it's days from now or whether it's a week from now. it's a short period of time where he will no longer hold that office. but he as a person remains, and he still has access to some means of communication. so the question is - becomes - does this kind of - should we be planning for an era in which street violence promulgated by whoever is a reality? and if that is the case, what should happen?

the final rule, to be published in the federal register next week, says consumers who want to sign up for an aca plan with their same insurer for 2018 would have to repay past-due premiums from the previous 12 months before being granted new coverage. because obamacare has allowed a three-month grace period before people who haven't paid premiums are kicked out of coverage, a consumer's overdue premiums could tally hundreds of dollars — even more than $1,000.
in an interview shortly after his protest began, kaepernick told nfl media, to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. kaepernick has not played in the nfl since parting ways with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season. he alleges that the nfl colluded to deny him a contract as punishment for his role in the player protests. last week, an arbitrator ruled that his grievance against the league merits a formal hearing.
hits different — perhaps you've encountered this coinage over the last year or so, since its leap from a corner of youtube fandom into the mainstream lexicon of social media. the extraordinary solo piano album that jarrett released last year, budapest concert, hits different with the knowledge that it's a souvenir of his final tour. hooded procession (read the names outloud), the elegiac closing track from ambrose akinmusire's latest album, hits different in light of the #sayhername chants following the death of breonna taylor — even though, as the song urges us to consider, the underlying injustice goes back farther than any of us can recall.

kailath: retreating would hurt the local economy, too. if people leave, their property taxes go with them. brister would rather keep people in their homes by building new flood barriers. the state's new plan does call for that, but there's not enough money budgeted yet. and even if there were, it would take 30 years to finish building something strong enough to keep caronia and his neighbors dry. he says he doesn't have that kind of time.

so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. but these families were also able to give their children more schooling. and now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. if so, says evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — nurith aizenman
the campaign also provided a response from african-american pastor mark burns, who campaigns frequently with trump. in a statement, burns said, mr. trump's critics are just that, critical. african-americans aren't stupid, we are worse off than where we were eight years ago. we are, as a people, tired of being used by the democratic party. black lives don't matter to hillary clinton, black voting power matters to hillary clinton.

but the gcf has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes jessica brown of the climate policy initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. the world bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. the bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. and it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. the gcf faces no such constraints.

not going to happen with me, folks, not going to happen. due to a supreme court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. and by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. there are often terrible consequences, such as casey chadwick's tragic death in connecticut just last year. yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries, secretary hillary clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. and they would comply if we would act properly. in other words, if we had leaders who knew what they were doing, which we don't.

in terms of the handling of this differently than what we saw over the summer, i think there's no question it was very much soft policing, so soft that it was immediately overrun by the insurrectionists and the rioters. and we saw hard policing this summer in washington, d.c., as well as other places around the country. and i think there's a couple reasons for that. i mean, one is i think, you know, we'd be foolish to ignore the fact of the difference between this being a bunch of white people, primarily white people who were supporters of the president as opposed to the summer's events being racial justice demonstrators who were very mixed race. certainly, obviously, a lot of black americans but also a lot of white americans and other americans of color and non-americans as well participated in those. and i think that's something that has to be looked at, that disparity that seems to be based on, at least in many ways, the color of the skin and the support - the political support of the protesters.

russakoff: well, that was another case of, like, you know, this enormous gap between the people who have come to save the newark children and the people who actually cared for and taught the newark children. and it became a huge flashpoint because mark zuckerberg had indicated that he wanted to give teachers enormous bonuses if they were the top teachers in the district. and that wasn't possible because the district just didn't have the money to pay those bonuses beyond the time that they would have the zuckerberg money. so there were some merit bonuses put into the contract, but they were relatively small. and the new contract that came out of this reform effort also required teachers in quite a few schools to work longer hours, longer years and to work some weekends for a pretty small stipend that was added to their annual pay. it was $3,000, which they calculated came to about $10 an hour. and they were just - you know, they felt they had been kind of conscripted into working these extra hours and extra days while the people who were in the district, you know, scripting these plans as consultants were getting a thousand dollars a day. and it really became something that turned the teachers - even teachers who wanted - very much wanted change - it turned them against the reform effort.

unfortunately, we don't have an overarching number so that's why we still talk in estimates and that maintains the problem. but if you look at states like texas, where they were one of the pioneers in auditing and inventory in their kits, they had 20,000 kits. we had thousands in cities alone and the numbers were to say the least disturbing. in illinois, 4,000 kits. michigan, 11,000 in detroit alone. in ohio, 4,000 kits found in cleveland and then 10,000 kits across the state.
one reason for this mindset, says renzo guinto, a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. in the colonial era, european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.
a spokesperson for the king county sheriff's office, sgt. cindi west, says someone requested documents in may 2015, shortly after brown's arrest, but didn't initially identify himself as an investigator for the nfl. west said in any event the information was withheld because the investigation into brown was open and active.

as of last january, short-term health plan enrollment applications and related materials were required to prominently display a warning that the plan doesn't satisfy the health insurance coverage requirements under the aca. there's no requirement that people acknowledge in writing that they understand what they're buying, however. since these short-term plans aren't considered adequate coverage, you may have to pay a penalty just like people who don't buy any insurance.

gallup, which has tracked public opinion on this issue, found that 65 percent of americans favor a path for immigrants who are living illegally in the u.s. to remain in the country and become citizens if they meet certain requirements over time. that's essentially reflected in the vote margin of the 2013 senate bill — 68 u.s. senators voted in favor of comprehensive immigration reform that included only a path to citizenship after immigrants pay fines and wait more than a decade without committing a crime.

so we can no longer apply pressure to other nations in terms of their foreign or domestic policy, their votes in the u.n., their defense acquisition plans with the assumption that they need us more than we need them. even small and comparatively less powerful countries now have other options, specifically in the forms of china and russia. and while we think these options are inviable in the long term, the governments and populations of other nations do not. you have china presenting itself as an alternative to the u.s. for economic growth, complete with cheap financing, kickbacks, the no-strings-attached policy. and you have russia presenting itself as an alternative to the u.s. for national security - more specifically, your regime's security. they won't simply sell you arms and train your troops. they'll protect your seat and power. and these tantalizing options mean u.s. leverage and influence abroad is reduced. and i think that's dangerous.

detroit – the motor city – will come roaring back. we will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. the other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.

i can think of no better summation of our shared experience over the last year than a world lost, the title of the piece that opens maria schneider's data lords. a slow, foreboding dirge in an oblong time signature, it instantly sets a tone of somber contemplation. revisiting it now, as an overture to the most critically acclaimed jazz album of 2020, i hear a chronicle of pained nostalgia — mindful of the unbearable losses of life and livelihood, and the more slippery deprivations of place and custom, that marked the past year. i also think of all the old rituals that knitted a constituency into a scene, and how many of those were taken for granted.
according to three people with knowledge, the new biden team appears poised to bring suspended executives back into the agency fold, replace the network chiefs appointed by pack last month and to appoint new boards. the biden administration did not immediately comment on pack's departure. a permanent ceo for the u.s. agency for global media will require approval by the senate, now led by democrats rather than republicans, though pack inspired an outcry on both sides of the aisle.

we're losing, they're winning, says the brooking institution's michael o'hanlon. they maybe don't say it in quite those terms, because they like the fact that we're still pulling the wool collectively over our own eyes, but the idea of defeating isis, replacing (syrian president bashar) assad, and doing all this with a minimal american military investment, does not add up to a logical policy.

what's more, trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist america first policy. so there is a question about the trump doctrine: when does the united states intervene and when does it not? what is the trigger to say, ok, this is where the united states gets involved?

the difference now is that the commissioner of baseball, bud selig, actually cares. and my suspicion, as a cynical baseball fan, is that he cares because he sees his legacy being written as the guy who didn't care about steroids. that's not to, you know, say that ryan braun isn't a total jerk, and alex rodriguez isn't a total jerk and that he didn't do all of these things, but i wonder that they're being made examples of to fulfill a larger, more selfish mission on the part of major league baseball. which, from a due process perspective, would have to be troubling.

if interest rates rise, the situation trump described, the market value of long-term debt falls. for example, a 30-year bond issued in 2015 at an interest rate of less than 3.0 percent, might sell for less than 70 percent of its nominal value if the long-term interest rate crosses 6 or 7 percent, which it certainly could. the treasury could buy up long-term debt in the market at its current market value, and replace it with new debt that paid a higher interest rate. this won't change the interest payments owed by the government, but it would reduce the nominal value of the debt outstanding.
that latest poll from the washington post found that 87 percent of americans support a program that allows undocumented immigrants to stay in the united states if they arrived here as a child, completed high school or military service and have not been convicted of a serious crime. an nbc news/survey monkey poll released tuesday likewise found that 66 percent of americans support the daca (deferred action for childhood arrivals) policy, which protects those who were brought into the united states as undocumented children from being deported.
