speaking in an interview with fox news conducted on the sidelines of the rally, trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: we'll see what happens. about his push for a border wall, trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. a wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. it's a moral thing, the president also said in the interview.
cohen: it may be that president trump is fulfilling his negotiating strategy by setting out an extreme position and then having it walk back to something that's more responsible. if it is and it works, ok, he'll get credit for that. but to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.

diamond: the tom price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. and, yes, politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. and i say our because i was teamed up with my wonderful colleague rachana pradhan. alex azar has been like the forrest gump of republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, azar would pop up in so many notable moments. he clerked for conservative justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. he worked on the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton. and then he was a lawyer working on the florida recount in 2000, bush v. gore. because bush won, alex azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the bush administration, ending up as the no. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at eli lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.

it's hard to predict how the republican-led legislatures in florida and texas will respond to the recent shootings. the scale of the orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. and the fact that the five victims of the dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.
police training executive rahr says she sent a memo to all her recruits and staff reminding them of the important role law enforcement can play in reassuring the public that our democracy can survive the politically divisive conflicts that are erupting. rahr adds the majority of law enforcement officers in this country are just as ashamed and disgusted as i am because the storming of the capitol is, there's there's no defense for that. there just isn't.

schmidt: well, that is if they could get out of detention. but, of course, the administration has announced that they're going to detain 100 percent of the new arrivals who cross at a place other than a port of entry. and they're going to expedite their cases. in fact, the president, as part of his executive order, ordered a new round of aimless docket reshuffling, which means those cases will go to the top of the front of the line. other cases that are ready to be heard will go to the back of the line. and judges that are handling dockets here and in other places will, in all likelihood, be moved to the border to hear these cases leaving nobody to hear the cases on their dockets - in arlington, new york, chicago, los angeles, wherever they regularly sit. so it will be a total mess in my view.

so you've reported that alex azar of health and human services and seema verma of medicare and medicaid both want to please president trump. how have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? and is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? in other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in trump's good graces?

inskeep: is the president's tough talk to adversaries or potential enemies really that much different than other presidents? i'm thinking about the way that president obama, before the iran nuclear deal, made a blanket statement - iran's not going to get a nuclear weapon. it would have been hard to mistake that as anything but a threat.
the democrat party has never been more outside the mainstream. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, trump said. he criticized democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.

but, when president nixon refused to turn over records and recordings requested by congress, tom railsback took to the floor to say, if the congress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to exonerate, we'll be regarded as a paper tiger.
al-omari: what is very clear is that he is committed towards doing something. what is less clear is how he is going to do it. things are complicated. the issues are complicated. there is no trust between the leaders. and on the palestinian side, at least, there are domestic political problems that can be an obstacle and so in israel. so unless we deal with these, i don't see how we can move forward.
standards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. as a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. the country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in february in the journal addiction.
the danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be â€” long term â€” less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains angela rasmussen, a virologist at the georgetown center for global health science and security. it could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.

the policy has taken many forms. less than two weeks after pompeo was sworn in as secretary of state in 2018, trump announced the withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal. the announcement was followed by the reinstatement of steep economic sanctions against tehran.
third, the process is mired in bureaucracy. the disinterments jpac does approve must go through additional government layers to the defense pow/missing personnel office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the army for final approval. while these steps tend to be a rubber stamp â€” the army has never turned jpac down â€” dna can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.

jennings: yeah. i think senator romney, senator-elect romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. i recall back in the summer, he wrote in the salt lake tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. he said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. i think he's also doing what a lot of republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. and that is not something that is unique to mitt romney. a lot of republican voters did that when they voted for donald trump in 2016. so mitt romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. and i expect he'll keep doing that.
schmidt: well, i don't think he understands the law and the constitution. according to the supreme court, everybody in the united states, regardless of status, has a right to due process under law. and you're not going to get due process from more border patrol agents. you're going to have to get judges of some type - give individuals fair hearings before an impartial decision-maker.

the president shapes the public character of the nation. trump's character falls short. that is a quote, an excerpt. actually, the headline of a scathing new washington post op-ed by mitt romney. the former massachusetts governor and republican presidential candidate praised president trump's tax cuts and his hard line on china. but the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the united states by a new senator from his own party. this comes as trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.

greene: so it almost sounds like donald trump had this line from the 1980s and maybe he's using the same line for a country that really has changed a lot?
kelemen: there are some signs that trump may already be moderating his positions. he says he's still studying whether to move the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. arab leaders have been privately urging him not to do that, and they've raised concerns about the israeli government's plans to expand settlements in the west bank. trump had a message for netanyahu on that today, too.

to try to move cases through more quickly, the trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. however, under former attorney general jeff sessions, the department of justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. if reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.
greene: so trade is the other big issue here on this visit. the trump administration, as we know, has pulled out of the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement that was so prominent on the campaign trail. and they keep talking about, quote, bilateral agreements. what is the point of stressing that word?
some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. and if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.

with less than a dozen days left in power, the trump administration on friday approved a radically different medicaid financing system in tennessee. with this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from washington, allowing tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.

it's not a new idea. in fact, oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity â€” $8.4 trillion in 2018 â€” with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity â€” $1.4 trillion. the reports coincide with the world economic forum, where elites gather in davos, switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.
the question of whether we've abdicated, though, is a - much more than a trump question because this really began in the obama administration. president obama was much less committed to the american global role. and, you know, let's set aside these questions of exceptionalism that's obsessed, you know, the front pages but just less committed to an american leadership profile abroad...
so how america responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most americans don't know much about. so let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. let's start with alex azar, who's the head of health and human services. he took over after tom price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.
in overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.
michael bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by president trump's decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the u.n. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.
simon: let's start with north korea and you first, danielle pletka. does flying halfway around the world to get nothing suggest the administration just isn't doing its homework?
denman was steam rolled, said melinda haring of the atlantic council, a washington, dc, think tank, who believes the language the trump campaign approved is weaker. and she says it's anyone's guess what trump would do regarding ukraine and russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.
cronauer: and then i would say, good morning, vietnam, and then start into the program that way.
adelson made his fortune â€” a net worth of around $35 billion according to an estimate by forbes â€” in the casino hotel industry. he spent much of it backing conservative politicians in the u.s. and israel, shaping the political debate of both countries.
what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.
qannam beat out a diverse mix of 23 other contestants, who held election rallies and critiqued sitting ministers. he is from east jerusalem, which palestinians hope will be the capital of a future state, and is the son of refugees â€” two traits he says made him popular in the west bank.

thompson: well, there's no real correlation between border security and this shutdown. the president has tried to manufacture and up the ante by this shutdown. we have some 800,000 employees. we have 450 airports in this country manned by tsa workers who may or may not get paid this friday. that's not how you run an effective system of national security for those who travel. our coast guard individuals, as you know, recently got paid because of a unique formula for handling the money. i'm not certain that they will be able to do it next time. those men and women of tsa and the coast guard do a wonderful job.
under the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. that could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.
now, there are also new things. japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when president trump would like to build more infrastructure in the u.s. and also remember that in 2011 following the fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, japan shut down its nuclear plants. so now japan is a very good market for u.s. exports of oil and natural gas.
but until that day comes â€” if ever â€” there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. the oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.

and some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. they relate to the rule of law. they relate to the separation of power. it relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. and if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. and that's - i think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.

whether this change in the way tennessee's medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. the incoming biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.
we have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says dr. marc fishman, medical director at maryland treatment centers in baltimore. he says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.

cities, states, localities in the united states do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. and some in california have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. california governor gavin newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. so if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.

many environmental groups praised wolf's emissions reduction goals, including the environmental defense fund.
gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?

it is worth noting that bangladesh is not ukraine.
the trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. and the selection of a rally in el paso was no accident either â€” trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the u.s. border town compared to its mexican counterpart. however, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in el paso.

on a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. in some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said ruhm. in the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.

in late january, senator elizabeth warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the american conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. it's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. warren calls the policy her ultra-millionaire tax. it would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.

diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.

o'brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. but he is optimistic about the odds. major agencies like the international monetary fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the world economic forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.
senator romney has expressed his concerns to chairman johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle, said spokeswoman liz johnson. he will therefore vote to let the chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.
diamond: the trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. and there is some truth to that. now tests have been churned out. but the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. and even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.
the show, broadcast on the maan satellite network, was popular â€” and he is recognized on the streets of ramallah â€” in part because he's the closest palestinians have gotten to choosing a leader in more than a decade. the real president of the palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a five-year term.

costello: well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then i can't support you.

it was the summer of 2015. i was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. and she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that mona, the water isn't being treated properly in flint. and because of that, there's probably lead in the water. and that's the moment that my life changed. when i heard the word lead, it was a call to action. i respect the science of what lead does. i understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. and i also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. it's the last thing our kids in flint needed. that's the moment i stopped sleeping, i stopped eating, i lost about 30 pounds. and i began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.
for transparency, the company notified appropriate health authorities about the program in advance and is participating in all relevant monitoring and reporting obligations under the emergency use authorization, moderna said in a press release.
the only reason that clause is in there is that they considered the possibility of jumping the queue and it allows them the option of doing so, he says, adding that emergent's insistence that it intends for its employees to wait their turn doesn't mean much.
while government funding remains vital, espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the paris climate change agreement.
every immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said philadelphia immigration attorney matthew archambeault. in either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.
new york gov. andrew cuomo took what what he calls the ultimate step in his state to protect the public, signing an executive order mandating that 100% of workforce must stay home, excluding essential services.
normally progressives like to point to europe for policy success. not this time. the experiment with the wealth tax in europe was a failure in many countries. france's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. only last year, french president emmanuel macron killed it.

democrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists â€” similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.
and that's certainly a pressing issue. even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the world bank has warned that progress is slowing. what's more worrying, according to oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.
mona hanna-attisha, a pediatrician who was among the first to raise a red flag over the contamination, said in an interview with npr's morning edition that having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.
i think the process has been less conducive to a careful and thorough consideration of exact wording than in the past, he says.
david makovsky: right now, the arab states have an under-the-table relationship with the israelis, and whatever they get from israel under the table they get for free, so to speak. so i don't know if they have an incentive to go above the table, and i don't know if that's going to bring the palestinians in or not.
naming austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.
the researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation â€” whether it tightens or loosens gun laws â€” depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.

trump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.
he was in the first wave of superwealthy americans to take advantage of the supreme court's controversial citizens united ruling, which opened the doors to eight- and nine-figure political donations so long as the money goes to independent superpacs and not candidates or party committees.

the disparity in what americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. jeff bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. but a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.

according to nbc news, o'rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. and bloomberg news reported that o'rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. at various points during his own rally, trump claimed that 69,000 people had rsvp'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. but nbc news reported that trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.
state officials in tennessee applauded the approval.
kerry, a biden surrogate, is alluding to the belief among some democrats that the party should pick a nominee younger than the 77-year-old â€” and is batting it down.
today, dorothy is homeschooling her son and daughter with the help of a novel item on the school choice menu: the gardiner scholarship. this voucher program, created in 2014, can be used by students with specific disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy and down syndrome. it has grown rapidly and is now used by 7,000 florida students.
after a few years, seeking even more customization, his parents applied for the gardiner. now ewan makes his own schedule, attending astronomy lectures at nearby universities, studying german, sampling free online college courses and learning to take photographs and use his own telescope. he is blowing me away with some of the stuff he is understanding, says his mother, alicia. and that is because of the gardiner.
but at this point, we do not have, from the white house, any clear directive on what the country should do. and with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.
to have such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset for this country. i think people should really grab that opportunity, said plank, whose company makes sports apparel.

when joe biden's win became clear in early november, mitch mcconnell stood on the senate floor. instead of congratulating the obvious winner, he gave a carefully worded statement. he did not repeat the president's false claims of fraud but did say the formal process should play out.
gross: trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. he didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. it would look bad; it would make him look bad. so what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?
that may be the end of his presidential bid, trump said, mocking o'rourke as a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.
cohen: well, you have people like former secretary of defense bill perry now writing that his biggest fear is we're going to have a nuclear explosion in his lifetime. that's worrisome.

martin: sorry to interrupt you, scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff john kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?
under the paris accord, the u.s. sent some $1 billion to the green climate fund that is guided by the u.n. framework convention on climate change â€” the body that coordinates international climate policy. the u.s. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.

garcia-navarro: but polls show that for democrats in new hampshire, the most important thing is not policies. it is, as you say, beating trump. but people have very different opinions on what's needed. and do you think that's why democrats are so fractured right now? - because each candidate has some weaknesses when you look at that equation.
it is a stupid tax. it's poorly targeted, burman says.
but trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally o'rourke, el paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily democratic city. exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, trump claimed that o'rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.
paul schmidt: it's my pleasure, scott.
the state has made progress on some policy fronts, joining a group of states developing a clean transportation policy, cracking down on methane leaks and releasing a plan for greater solar energy development.
jennings: well, he works at the speed of the institution. i mean, i think most republicans said after the election that if donald trump had issues with the votes that he should take it to court. that's the proper venue for the adjudication of claims. he did that. every single court that looked at it did not agree. the electoral college met. and that's immediately when mitch mcconnell acknowledged that joe biden was the president-elect. and then yesterday, after the president would not stop indulging this fantasy that the election was stolen, mitch mcconnell took to the senate floor and made a powerful speech. and i thought, frankly, it was one of his finest hours. it's regrettable that he had to actually give that speech.
so many people ask me, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? and there's not one villain. there's not 10 villains. there [are] many villains. and this is what i say in my book:
metro by t-mobile used to be a regional cell phone company a few years ago and has now branched out nationwide. metro uses t-mobile's hspa+ and lte network, as it is owned entirely by the larger carrier. t-mobile's network has become one of the strongest networks in populated areas but even with all of the improvements, you should check the coverage map to be sure you're covered.
now, as president-elect, trump is sounding the same notes. he caused a veritable earthquake in u.s.-china relations just by taking a call from taiwan's president tsai ing-wen. this challenged the bedrock of u.s. relations, the one china policy, under which the u.s. officially recognizes only the government in beijing, though it also conducts business with taipei.
npr reporter mary louise kelly lied to me, twice. first, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record, he said. it is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. this is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt president trump and this administration. it is no wonder that the american people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.

tom railsback worked with democrats to draft an article of impeachment that charged president nixon with abuse of his authority to obstruct the watergate investigation. it was this article that won support from six republicans on the judiciary committee. and when richard nixon realized he could not take republican support for granted, he resigned in august of 1974.
gross: it's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the united states is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.
for one thing, if trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. and experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.

diamond: ...to have someone tip me off because that is a question that i've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. the world health organization did have a working test. someone somewhere made the decision that the u.s. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.

democrats want to work on a sound border system, rep. thompson says
in a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, donald trump directed some of his strongest words toward china. he called the chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of america's leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on china.
ramachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. the oxfam report agrees that funding of public services â€” especially ones that protect and empower women and girls â€” is crucial to reducing inequality.
but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.

jennings: well, you're right. they don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. but he ought to. in my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing daca. fixing daca was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. it's something he has endorsed before. that would give pause, i think, to this democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. a lot of these new members of congress ran on a fix for daca. i think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for daca. that's a win for everybody...

shmuel rosner: a sense within israel and among many israelis that there is a growing tendency to delegitimize israel as the nation-state of the jewish people, to somehow argue that even being a nation-state is in some way not legitimate. so many israelis feel as if israel is under siege, and they felt the need to make a statement.

it was the reality, he said. the tests are just demonstrating what was.
diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.

the gardiner is not a good fit for every special-needs student. alicia points out that $10,000 doesn't go a long way for students who might need speech, occupational or behavioral therapy on a daily or weekly basis, as ewan did when he was younger. in dorothy's case, her children's therapies are paid for by medicaid, because she adopted them from medical foster care. but, a lot of parents who do have children with more complex needs are still left in limbo, alicia says.

it's a unique and ethically fraught clause that doesn't appear in any of the other operation warp speed contracts npr has reviewed. although the contract doesn't explicitly state that the company will vaccinate its workers ahead of people at higher risk of covid-19, it could have that effect. and extending vaccination to family members heightened concerns that the provision would mean delays for other people prioritized for immunization.

president trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.
liasson: well, what i make of it is there's not only a big breach between trump and the intelligence community. there's also a breach between trump and a bipartisan group of senators on capitol hill who say there should be hearings. there was the initial reaction from some republicans where they didn't want to undermine trump's victory, but other republicans want to get to the bottom of this. they consider this a cyberattack. they don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. we also have the report that the obama administration has asked for to be completed before obama leaves office. that means it would probably come out right before trump's inauguration.
cronauer: whatever happened to be currently popular, again, looking at what were the popular songs in the states and assuming that the gis who came over from the states would want to hear what's popular back at home. our whole idea was whether it was in the music policy or the production that we did on the air, it was to make it sound as much as possible like a stateside radio station to give them a little link with home as a morale factor.
the supply is in addition to the commitments to the us, so the supply actually increases the capacity and number of individuals in [the] us who can be vaccinated, and in effect speeds up vaccination for those not in moderna's program, moderna spokesman ray jordan told npr.

cohen: well, it takes a long time to build an alliance. it can be destroyed very quickly. and it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what i would call, like a blind samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of world war ii. those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera. if you take down the pillars, what replaces it?

ross benjamin, 30, traveled here this morning from just across the border in wisconsin. he's planning to vote for biden because he thinks biden has the best shot to win over moderates and republicans. but benjamin says if he weren't worried about all that, he'd rather pick warren or vermont sen. bernie sanders, who last night packed an arena for a partylike rally featuring the band vampire weekend.
fuller clark: right. and i think the country is looking for a president who is going to be able to bring us all together, regardless of our backgrounds.

this strategy makes tons of sense, dr. robert wachter of the university of california, san francisco wrote in an email to npr. we know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.
cronauer: it was basically a traditional, ordinary, run-of-the-mill radio station control room. the only real reminder of the war was the fact that on the console beside the turntables was a loaded .45. over in the newsroom, there was another one beside the teletype machines. and we were instructed that if it was necessary, we were expected to use it.

goldstein, of the university of pennsylvania, says trump might be using tactics he learned in the business world, where you often stake out your toughest positions in the beginning.
many overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. according to ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. he estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.
the biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.
he's a showman. he's a pied piper. he's the music man, weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. more recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.
also important, zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. and smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt european efforts. some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. it's true, but it creates a huge loophole: buy lots of art! economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.
certainly, it's not going to be an easy vote to win, says state sen. darren soto, d-orlando. but we put something forward that i believe is narrowly tailored for both parties to get behind.

gross: my impression is that he is anti-abortion. he has described hhs as the department of life. he described the trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. he said that in a very admiring way. how has that affected him as the leader of hhs? and was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?
gross: how did you sign on the first morning that you did your show?
cronauer: no. the reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. we did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. first of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. but secondly, there was a reaction that i would get mostly when i went out into the field. we would get an occasional card and letter. but if i'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? and i'd say cronauer. and they'd say, oh, yeah, i think i - and i'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. and i found out later on that many times the gis, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if i'd do the good morning, vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the gi equivalent of get stuffed, cronauer.

simon: from your point of view, mr. costello, does the republican party need to renounce donald trump?
more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.
simon: but before you go on, washington post/abc poll says nearly 6 in 10 republicans and republican-leaning independents say they want to follow trump's lead.
in 1990, twelve countries in europe had a wealth tax. today, there are only three: norway, spain, and switzerland. according to reports by the oecd and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countriesâ€”and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.

it's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.
inskeep: the president made that case from behind his desk in the oval office. it was a pose, before the cameras, that predecessors since harry truman have assumed. in this case, the president was demanding a border wall as his price for reopening parts of the government. those listening to the speech included our next guest. he is representative bennie thompson of mississippi. he is the top democrat on the house homeland security committee, which means he is the newly empowered chairman.

so, oxfam proposes, let's tax the rich to help the poor.
diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.
we both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists, johnson said. we're not isolationists. we're non-interventionists. we don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe.

long-term, the governor wants to see an 80-percent reduction by 2050.
thompson: well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. we wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. so what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. so what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. so again, let me be very clear. democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.
pope francis has accused victims of sexual abuse in chile of slander, saying their attacks on a bishop who's accused of covering up the abuse amount to calumny. the remarks triggered anger and demonstrations in chile, where several churches have been firebombed in the past week.

but is a global wealth tax realistic?
cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money â€” whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most â€” to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.

inskeep: which was a common theme of the people who supported the president here. they didn't repeat the president's lies quite so much as just saying, look; there are allegations we should investigate. but this is an obvious cynical ploy. why do you think a large part of the party was addicted to that?

fishman, the addiction doctor in baltimore, knows there are people like testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. but, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. he wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.

he argues the warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. unlike in the european union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. existing u.s. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the caribbean, they're still on the hook. on top of that, warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.
inskeep: i want to be as clear as we can that the president, i think, if you talk about inviting japan to get nuclear weapons, he said different things. i think he may have even denied that he ever said the thing that he had in fact previously said. so he seems to have backed off. but it sounds like you're just arguing that that uncertainty about what the president means is the problem.
on the subject of foreign policy, johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.

among those staying on the council are the ceos of several major companies that have substantial federal government contracts, including lockheed martin and united technologies.
warren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. this higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.
diamond: i think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and i think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. we are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the united states. if there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.
wolf on tuesday also announced the greengov council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. the council has several of its own targets:

fuller clark: i think they don't have the same level of experience as joe biden, and they certainly don't have the credentials with regard to foreign affairs and international policies, which are so key and at great risk with our current president. so i also think that joe biden is very well-liked. he's very compassionate. he has great integrity. he's trusted by voters from all different political directions. that's really important if we're going to be able to win in november.

and a wealth tax may not even be legal. the ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the u.s. constitution. legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. the debate, josh barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.

tax the ultrarich to solve poverty? easier said than done
the efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. but those might be months and months away. so in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the united states, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. there's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.
but, look; once the election was over and the claims had been adjudicated and the votes were counted, mitch mcconnell stuck by the institution and the norms and the gears of our democracy. and he was not about to let donald trump live in an alternate bubble. and i think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. and he - and - you know, convinced most of the republicans in the senate that the republicans should not indulge what donald trump was doing. it's, i think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.

this has been a problem from the beginning of the affordable care act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for medicare, says bonnie burns, a consultant for the consumer group california health advocates. once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for medicare, nobody told them to make that change.
jennings: well, i think that the president says he wants a wall, and john kelly no longer works there. so (laughter) i don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. but i know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. and i know the democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. that's why i think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. that's why i think reintroducing daca as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what i negotiated for you.
martin: so the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the white house. it's day 12 of this shutdown. democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?

thompson: well, i think, first of all, you have to say that the president didn't give us anything new. we have a problem with immigration, but we can fix it. what we're dealing with now, though, is a manufactured problem created by some policies implemented by this administration that has actually put a greater strain on our system of immigration.

preble: well, i think people are concerned about it, and i think they should be concerned about that. the united states has a track record of using military force and violating the sovereignty of a number of countries, not just in this hemisphere but around the world. so i think that it is important to emphasize that there is a constitutional process that juan guaido is - has a legitimate claim. and i think it's equally important that the lima group, not just the organization of american states but an organization - a loose coalition of states not led by the united states has endorsed guaido is significant. but i think the united states could complicate things if it implies, as some have, that ultimately the united states is going to determine this by force.
to make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. and we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).

at the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.
the power utility began greening its own fleet in 2017, purchasing electric sedans and trucks to use in lieu of ones powered by gasoline or diesel.
a related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. it should be evident to any observer of life in the u.s. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.

according to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. my work with ryan and deci identifies three broad forms of potential â€” social, intellectual, and productive/creative â€” the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.
a number of asia analysts believe tillerson likely misspoke or overstated the positions a trump administration will take.

diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.

and then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. the president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that europe is now a source of america's problems. on one level, he's right; the virus came out of china, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. i think the trump administration did have good reason to shut down china travel in late january, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.

to all those who did not support us, biden said, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. if you still disagree, so be it. that's democracy. that's america. the right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion.
similar opinions have been voiced in florida, another republican-controlled state, since the orlando shooting. nightclubs like pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. at least one republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in florida.

no other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, johnson says. it gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.
president trump has shed a spotlight on this idea. his 100-day plan mentioned redirect[ing] education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. however, some in the homeschooling movement oppose vouchers. the home school legal defense association has called them a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.

the interview began with a series of questions about the trump administration's policy toward iran. pompeo defended the president's maximum pressure campaign against tehran, saying it is absolutely working.
while the george w. bush and barack obama administrations rejected such a move, trump's administration embraced the policy.
the whole rally largely stuck to trump's usual talking points â€” ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with north korean leader kim jong un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his state of the union address.
the two biggest u.s. car companies, general motors and ford, don't rely as much on exporting to china. instead, they build the majority of cars they sell in china in that country. the chinese market is important for both of them â€” gm sells more cars in china than it does in the u.s. but because most of those cars are built and sold in china, the sales are not subject to the tariffs.

behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.

on the last day of his visit to chile, francis set the simmering resentment some hold against the catholic church to a full boil with his defense of bishop juan barros. the bishop has been hotly criticized ever since the pope appointed him in 2015. barros was the protÃ©gÃ© of rev. fernando karadima, a notorious disgraced priest who served in the southern city of osorno and who was found guilty and dismissed in 2011 for abusing dozens of minors over a decades-long period beginning in the 1980s.
scott jennings: good morning. thank you.
diamond: well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. but his critics would say that alex azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.

martin: which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. republican strategist scott jennings for us this morning.
diamond: well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. we're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the centers for disease control. we don't have enough supplies, like respirators. our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. and i think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in italy, in spain, with their hospitals and icus totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.
trump awarded miriam adelson the presidential medal of freedom in 2018; the citation praised her work and philanthropy in combating addiction. you have been truly incredible, trump told her at the event, before looking out to the crowd. here to celebrate miriam's award is sheldon. where is sheldon? where is sheldon? where is he? there he is. oh, you didn't make the front row. he's probably angry.
gross: are there cuts the trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? for example, wasn't there a national security council health task force that was disbanded under trump?
inskeep: so is homeland security at greater risk because of that situation?
we do not seek to cancel the role of the older generation, says qannam, who is a member of fatah. we rather want to encourage our role, to find a role for us.

pompeo has come under criticism â€” including, at times, from career diplomats in his own department â€” for failing to more forcefully defend yovanovitch in the face of political attacks. during testimony before impeachment investigators, for example, michael mckinley, a former senior adviser to pompeo, said he resigned from the department in part over what he interpreted to be a lack of public support for department employees.
president trump is a republican who hasn't had a particularly conservative foreign policy. he called the iraq war the single worst decision ever made. he's lauded russia, praised north korea and said he'll withdraw u.s. troops from afghanistan and syria. this week, he came back from hanoi with no deal with kim jong un. there's the prolonged humanitarian political crisis in venezuela and shifting - are they staying or going - policies of u.s. troops in syria and afghanistan. is this administration's foreign policy unraveling?

i think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible â€” as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [if] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.
methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. a phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. while doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.

and i think mcconnell's view is in a closely divided government, policy ought to be made between the 40-yard lines. i do think he considers joe biden a friend. he was the only senate republican to go to beau biden's funeral. i think he thinks there are areas where they can work together. and after what happened yesterday...

gross: ok. thank you for the (laughter) clarification. so how does their desire to please trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? and that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.
donald trump: i think it's ridiculous. i think it's just another excuse. i don't believe it. i don't know why. and i think it's just, you know, they talk about all sorts of things. every week, it's another excuse. we had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the electoral college.
trump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.
ten years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.
in oklahoma, social media posts raise questions about canadian county sheriff chris west, because of statements attributed to him on a since-deleted facebook account. west said at a press conference that he only attended the rally and did not push past police or enter the capitol. last friday, west said the egregious crimes on our beacon and bastion of last hope for our nation, breaking into that and terrorizing it, i rebuke all of that, every bit of it.

inskeep: you're saying that he could inadvertently encourage russian aggression, inadvertently encourage north korean aggression because those countries might get the idea that the united states is not really truly standing behind its allies.
diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.

estrin: the druze are a religious group, an offshoot of islam. they're ethnic arabs. but unlike most other arab citizens, they've committed to serving in the israeli army. they get a lot of praise from israeli leaders, and they're outspoken israeli patriots, which is why it was unusual for the israeli druze community's religious leader, sheikh moafaq tarif, to say this at the protest.
after holland approves a case, it then goes to the desk of maj. gen. kelly mckeague, jpac's military commander. he has never denied a request, but he says the extreme scrutiny is more than justified. the work jpac does, mckeague says, matters more than work the fbi might do in a death penalty case.

biden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. but you can bet that republicans will find plenty to disagree with democrats about in how to solve those issues. and what of unity then? more importantly, what of solving those issues when biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of republican opposition?
one of the top philosophical statements we make to recruits is you are guardians of the democracy. you're not just there to investigate crimes, but you're there to actually uphold the democracy, because our country depends on the rule of law, rahr told npr. and what happened at the capitol was completely against everything that the concept of the rule of law stands for.
after walking up to the white house, biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. he then hugged his wife and held the embrace. they took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.
but the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. as another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on capitol hill emerged with a deal monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's department of homeland security funding bill). this will fund about 55 miles of fencing.

last summer, medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. the notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in marketplace and medicare coverage. officials also began contacting individuals who already have both medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.
diamond: as one official has said, terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? the trump administration and health officials knew back in january that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. they knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. but across the month of february, as my colleague david lim at politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. they were coming back with errors.

there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices â€” then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.
new york has confirmed more than 7,100 cases of the coronavirus that causes covid-19, making it by far the largest single source of the nearly 15,500 cases now reported in the u.s. as of friday, 38 people in the state had died from the respiratory disease. nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for killing at least 205 people.

what usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. but trump could not be shamed.

inskeep: you're exactly correct that mcconnell did not give in to it yesterday, but i do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. mitch mcconnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. he did not always support the president. on a number of occasions, he criticized the president. but there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. should he have said more sooner?

holland acknowledges that the best way to honor those individuals would be to identify them, and that the quickest way to do that would be to exhume them and use dna. still, he's conservative; he says he's handcuffed by pentagon policy and hesitant to lose any more autonomy by pushing for more disinterments.

in 2007, adelson launched israel today, a free daily that has become israel's largest circulation newspaper. it features cheerleading coverage of netanyahu and his family, a key asset in netanyahu's longtime quest for positive press coverage in israel. when netanyahu addressed a joint session of congress in 2015 against the iran nuclear deal, adelson was in the gallery.

on the other hand, christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs â€” like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. these types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.

costello: interestingly - you know, i'm sure listeners have heard the term rino - right? - republican in name only. well, a rino used to be somebody who would be registered republican but often vote with democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of republicans. in the past four years, rino has essentially meant not doing whatever donald trump wants you to do or saying something critical of donald trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.

the recognition that preserving opportunities to live well requires preserving the integrity of the natural systems on which we rely is a critical first step. identifying the distinct forms of human impact and critical thresholds or planetary boundaries is an important further step that has been underway for some time. nine such boundaries have been identified, including safe rates of biodiversity loss, nitrogen removal from the atmosphere, phosphorus flowing into the oceans, consumption of freshwater, and land cover converted to cropland. from a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the paris climate accord.
given trump's tendency to hit back hard against anyone who crosses him, such companies may be especially reluctant to anger the white house.

without the alternative minimum tax, donald trump would have paid a lower tax rate in 2005 than the poorest half of americans â€” just 3.48 percent â€” despite income of more than $150 million. trump wants to abolish the amt. now we know why, said americans for tax fairness executive director frank clemente.

to me, every american is entitled to certain inalienable rights. and if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. and i think the flip side for republicans that gets democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. but we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the capitol with confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. it disgusts me. and you can't play to that. you have to outright reject it. and you have to say, i'm not interested in your support. i don't want your support. and if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.

those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.

(soundbite of the django festival allstars' tsigane fantasy)
jennings: well, i think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. and to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. the president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. these things are decided in the courts and at the state level. and to go on the senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. they wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.
the tariff reduction is seen as an olive branch to the trump administration. it comes as the two countries work to avoid a trade war after the tough-talk and tariff escalations last month.
diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
but many approve of the biden policy announced friday.
the other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. he said in that interview on fox, he says i'm a very smart person. i don't need briefings every day. i don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. and that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about china or north korea or iran? is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?
that was largely the case sunday when biden kicked off his final full day of campaigning at clarke university on the banks of the mississippi river in dubuque.

the head of the association of immunization managers, claire hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. the goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. get it, thaw it, give it.

of course not. flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. it never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. there's a long history of racism in flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.

it just raises questions about the government deal-making process and what information the government is actually disclosing to the public as well, rizvi says. i think it's a perfect example of why the government needs to be much more transparent when it comes to the terms of its deals with these giant pharmaceutical corporations.

this is beginning to place real choices in front of the iranian regime, pompeo said. you can see in the protests inside of iran. you can see the iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. all the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the american people are coming to fruition as a direct result of president trump's strategy.

within the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. a central argument of my book, living well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously â€” and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.

dan diamond: well, terry, i guess we can start with the good, such as it was. on wednesday night, nearly two months after the first u.s. case of novel coronavirus was detected, president trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. he's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. he has posted tweets, even on monday where he compared this to the flu. this is not the flu. the flu does not lead the national basketball association, the nba, to suspend its season.
tensions have since eased, but the episode has renewed questions about whether the president's maximum pressure campaign has emboldened tehran. since trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, iran has shot down a u.s. drone, targeted oil tankers in the strategic strait of hormuz, and been blamed for a debilitating attack on saudi oil facilities.
president donald trump: so i'm looking at two-state and one-state, and i like the one that both parties like.

i've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says michael botticelli, director of national drug control policy at the white house. we wouldn't do that with any other disease. if one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.
the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.
the misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. they come almost seven years after the city of flint began taking in water from the flint river in an attempt to save money. the water wasn't properly treated, and it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. more than 100,000 flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead.

perhaps this is just an attempt to gain bargaining leverage so that at some point, you make a deal that is better than the one you would've gotten if you'd been flexible at the beginning, he says.
pletka: well, yes, frankly, it does. i mean, i think that a lot of people felt, let's say, tolerably comfortable with the idea that donald trump wanted to start things off with a person-to-person meeting with kim jong un. but by the second meeting, it appeared that it was meeting for meeting's sake and that the north korean leader was taking the president of the united states for a ride.
al-omari: i think what's happening is when you sit in that office, you realize that there are complexities, there are national interest concerns that you simply don't see from the outside. and i think his policy, whether to this conflict or to the middle east in general, has evolved as he saw the complexities and what is at stake for the united states in the region.

uc berkeley economist gabriel zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the american policy agenda, played a part in designing warren's wealth tax. he says it was designed explicitly with european failures in mind.
a few moments later, an aide asked kelly to follow her into pompeo's private living room at the state department without a recorder. the aide did not say the ensuing exchange would be off the record.
but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.
the pentagon is considering pulling out of a deal it made with thousands of noncitizen recruits with specialized skills: join the military and we'll put you on the fast track to citizenship.

that line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including david lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in hagerstown, md. the home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. in addition to beds, lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. the emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. it's what worked for lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.
schmidt: each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. and therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. and the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. so some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. and, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. but sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. so that disrupts dockets.

luckily, most companies currently offer a wide range of choices for consumers, from well-known brand names to less known but surprisingly well-established companies. with so much competition from cell phone companies in the last few years, prices of phone plans have definitely fallen, along with plans being offered without contracts.
this groundbreaking waiver puts guardrails in place to ensure appropriate oversight and protections for beneficiaries, while also creating incentives for states to manage costs â€” while holding them accountable for improving access, quality and health outcomes, verma said. it's no exaggeration to say that this carefully crafted demonstration could be a national model moving forward.
it's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration, she said, referring to president trump's desire for funding additional barriers at u.s.-mexico border.
meanwhile, seema verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. but i've talked to officials who say that seema verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.

the president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall â€” the longest shutdown ever in u.s. history â€” was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. multiple polls also showed most americans blamed trump and republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.

i think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. the president said that travel from europe would be suspended for 30 days. that wasn't completely correct. the white house had to immediately walk that back. u.s. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. the president said that cargo would be banned from europe. that would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the eu. but it turned out that trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.

in a previous life, i worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. they very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. that may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. it's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.
he was a forceful advocate for moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem. adelson heavily supported former house speaker newt gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign in part because of his support for moving the embassy.

pletka: yes, a most regrettable phrase for a most regrettable - a badly managed, badly led and badly concluded operation in libya. so, you know, this has been a trend. and the one thing i think is absolutely clear, and i expect that chris will disagree with me about this, but the one thing i think is clear is that without presidential leadership, the american people don't actually understand or want to sign up to anything that we do overseas except perhaps global trade. and even there now, we see a question.

each year, thousands of americans miss their deadline to enroll in medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the affordable care act's marketplaces. that failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.
the proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old national environmental policy act, or nepa, which has not been updated in decades. as one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. it also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.

medicaid, part of president lyndon b. johnson's great society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. as a result, the more money states spend on medicaid, the more they get from washington.

on stage, trump claimed he didn't know the details and didn't want to hear about it, sticking to his robust talking points on the border wall.
at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.
we must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it, said alex gorsky, chief executive of johnson & johnson, in a statement released tuesday.
the cdc, the centers for disease control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. but one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like seattle. by the time that the trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. and now as we talk in march, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.
joe biden's campaign has been embarrassed by the consistent exhumations about that story, but the men haven't been accused of any lawbreaking.

meanwhile, alex azar has been the point person on president trump's goal of lowering drug prices. azar has pitched himself as the fixer. he worked in the drug industry at eli lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. but so far, a lot of the plans that the trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. so alex azar also hasn't been able to deliver. and that means both of them are conscious, azar and verma, of the need to show trump that they are delivering. and they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.

gross: what are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?
however, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. the evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.

maybe, technological advances in energy storage or capturing and storing carbon emissions will make an 80 percent drop easier to achieve, he said. it's also possible that at some point, the federal government could step in with sweeping policies aimed at reducing emissions, or that the public will become more willing to change carbon-intense habits by driving or flying less, for example.
the idea of having a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2050 will inform choices that we make now because energy investments are very long-lived, apt said.

israel passed a law last month that continues to cause controversy. the nation state law defines israel as the nation-state of the jewish people. critics say this law discriminates against religious minorities like muslims and christians who make up about a fifth of the israeli population. as npr's daniel estrin reports from tel aviv, this law is sparking protest from a religious group that's one of israel's staunchest supporters.

and i look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. but in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the u.s. just a step behind at every step of the way.

and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.

yet many people have missed the warnings.
liasson: well, it was pretty extraordinary. he rejected the consensus view of the intelligence community, that russia wasn't just interfering in the elections to sow chaos, actually trying to put its thumb on the scale in favor of trump. he put out an official statement - not a tweet - where he insulted the intelligence community, said these are the same people who brought us flawed intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction. he also suggested this morning that president obama might be trying to undercut his win, which, although it was decisive and even stunning, it was certainly not historic landslide, as trump just described it, because his 306 electoral votes rank him 46th out of 58 electoral college victories.

they are doing better than i ever could have imagined, says dorothy (we're not using her last name to protect her children's privacy). neither take any [psychiatric] medication anymore. there are no overstimulation issues.
we're going to take stock with two foreign policy experts who are conservatives. danielle pletka is with the american enterprise institute. thanks so much for being with us.
in texas, bexar county sheriff's lt. roxanne mathai, an eight-year veteran of the force, is on unpaid administrative leave after posting photos of herself in the pro-trump mob on a capitol balcony after rioters stormed past police lines. she called it on facebook one of the best days of her life. she also faces possible federal charges. a post on her facebook page also says and we are going in... in the crowd at the stairs...not inside the capitol like the others. not catching a case lol.
that's going to take some getting used to after these past four years.
surprisingly, athletes prefer manufactured snow because it is more consistent, he adds. when preparing the courses, organizers will actually push off natural snow before spreading the fake stuff.
inskeep: assuming that this does end up as a two-state solution, if it were to, let me just ask one bottom-line question. there are people who doubt whether israeli leader benjamin netanyahu is serious about endorsing a two-state solution even though he's formally endorsed it. of course, the opposite question is posed to president abbas.
i felt that that moment was the key to giving the youth a chance to participate in palestinian politics, qannam says.
vice president mike pence is traveling the pacific rim, where so much of president trump's foreign policy agenda has been focused, especially with these tensions with north korea. in tokyo this morning, the vice president repeated what he had said the day before in south korea.

yet perhaps no action has been more controversial than the administration's decision this month to launch the drone strike that killed maj. gen. qassem soleimani, the leader of iran's influential quds force, outside the airport in baghdad. while the administration has declined to offer specifics about the intelligence that prompted the strike, pompeo has defended the president's order, saying it was carried out in response to an imminent threat of attack on u.s. embassies.
johnson and sen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, have been seeking interviews with witnesses and documents about hunter biden for several months. they've contacted the department of homeland security, the state department and a political consultancy, blue star strategies â€” among others â€” with requests for responses.
in any event, the changes to the state's program will take months to implement because the shift in policy requires final approval by the legislature, and officials in tennessee must also negotiate quality of care targets with the administration.
gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
for example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the u.s. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.
freedompop offers a basic plan that is 100% free. yes, free! you can get truly free monthly cell phone service. but, it's very limited, with 200 minutes, 500 texts, 500 mb data each month. they charge $20 to activate your phone and another $10 to transfer your phone number to the carrier.
the proposal to dismantle the program would cancel enlistment contracts for many of the foreign-born recruits, leaving about 1,000 of them without legal protection from deportation.
qannam â€” perhaps trying out a politician's answer â€” is more diplomatic.
inskeep: a cold peace, as people have said.
the biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. they are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. they feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.
pompeo would not say whether direct u.s. engagement is taking place with iran but did say the administration has built a coalition that's working to put pressure on iran to end its missile program, its processing of uranium and the reprocessing of plutonium.
al-omari: a cold peace is better than a warm conflict.

the only way to deal with the issue of nepotism, he says, is to make palestinian institutions bigger and put the right person and the most qualified person in that job.
tom railsback, as of this moment, is a dead duck, declared the journal star of peoria, a city near his district.
instead, the biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. for people who've gotten initial shots, the biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.
inskeep: mitch mcconnell said his vote to override objections to this election was the most important vote of his 36 years in congress. as he spoke, insurrectionists were already descending on the capitol. they briefly disrupted the proceedings, although they resumed and were completed overnight.
the law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,'  says bruce huber of notre dame law school. if the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law.
wolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.
president donald trump: america proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. but all americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. among those hardest hit are african-americans and hispanic americans.
when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.

but there are no plans for either a palestinian legislative or presidential election.
it took several hours for grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. but with assistance from the medicare rights center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received part b coverage without a late fee or waiting period. it was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.
our policies have been dominated by the idea that a growing economy is what best enables everyone to find happiness in their own way, even as evidence has mounted that the damaging impact of human activities on planetary systems makes the explosive economic growth of recent decades unsustainable. the emergence of sustainability science, movement toward a post-carbon economy, and greater consideration of the environmental impacts of personal and institutional decisions are all signs that we are at least beginning to come to grips with the reality that we cannot persist in destabilizing the natural systems on which humanity relies without suffering severe and ultimately irreversible consequences.
both policies drew criticism from judges such as tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.
szybist with the nrdc said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.
as the nation's chief diplomat, pompeo has played a central role in shaping the president's more aggressive posture toward iran. it's a policy pompeo has described as reestablishing deterrence.

but the types of deductions favored by the ultrawealthy, such as tax shelters, don't get counted, burman says. income from capital gains also gets preferential treatment under the amt.
trump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. if medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. if enrollment drops, it will get less money.
gross: my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. after a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.
the gardiner has an additional layer of review. amy graham is the senior policy director for step up for students, the nonprofit which administers the gardiner. the group's role includes verifying that the expenditures that parents submit actually serve educational needs. we've had a variety of things that have been denied, she says, such as toys or entertainment videos.
i'm not going to comment on things that mr. mckinley may have said, pompeo said on friday. but he dismissed the suggestion that a shadow foreign policy involving ukraine was in place.

mitt romney attacks trump's character in 'washington post' op-ed
but from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events.
trump: this is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states - a dramatic increase. these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
people who may be eligible for the waiver, officially called time-limited equitable relief, must submit a request by sept. 30. you can find information on how to apply on the medicare rights center's medicare interactive website or can call the center's helpline at 800-333-4114.
in your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the trump administration is handling the epidemic. and just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in medicare and medicaid. and there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so medicare and medicaid missed a certain number of emails. they were out of the loop for a while. i mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. so what's the larger significance of stories like that?
the ukraine policy has been run from the department of state for the entire time that i have been here, and our policy was very clear, pompeo said.
frankly, knowing what cell phone carrier to go for is an exercise in patience. just comparing the prices of various mobile phone plans from each of the top cell phone companies can be quite exhausting. however, the entire thing shouldn't be that hard if you know exactly what you need from your cell phone plan.

libertarian party candidates gary johnson and bill weld pitched themselves as the antidote to washington partisanship in a cnn town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the republican and the democratic presidential nominees.

al-omari: what we see right now is indications that we have a more realistic, more grounded policy, at least that's the indications. whether this will be turned into concrete policies, it's too early to tell. it's only been three months. but certainly the trajectory is very different from what we see - what we saw from trump as a candidate versus trump the president.
i think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the white house, and we would hire the best people from the democratic party, the smartest people from the republican party and the best people from the libertarian party, weld added.
cohen: well, because the notion of nuclear weapons has been what we call normalized - this is just another weapon.
are you affected by coronavirus-related layoffs or pay cuts?
adrian cronauer: if you've seen the film, you'll notice at the very beginning there was a very dull, dry, boring, soporific announcement about how to get your hold baggage if you'd lost your duffel bag or your trunk out of tan son nhut air base. that is as accurate depiction as is humanly possible of what the station sounded like when i got there. and one of my aims was just to make it sound more like a stateside station.
saeb: i told the prime minister that we are not guests here. we are the real citizens, and we do actually the whole commitments. and we need to get all the rights.
i haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, wolf said.
just a few months ago, the republican party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among black and latino voters, gained seats in congress and controlled more state legislatures. now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. the identity of the republican party is tied up with white supremacists.
he says he met with abbas and urged him to install a quota among the municipal representatives for young members. he says he has not heard back.
green says the lack of clarity may be due to the lack of seasoned policy makers in the trump transition team and the limited input from the state department.
the exchange with mary louise kelly, co-host of all things considered, follows the release by house democrats last week of messages suggesting that yovanovitch may have been under surveillance in the days before she was told to return to washington from her posting in kyiv last year.
while vaccine manufacturers are no doubt essential, placing their workers in the highest risk group and allowing their families to get the vaccine at the same time they do is problematic, says bioethicist ruth faden, the founding director of the berman institute for bioethics at johns hopkins university. she is also a member of the world health organization's strategic advisory group of experts' working group on covid-19 vaccines.
the army said you can ship to basic training after you complete the background checks. but now they've canceled all the background checks so nobody can ship to basic training, she said.
greene has repeatedly endorsed the qanon conspiracy theory, which has sought to portray president trump as being undermined by a deep-state cabal.
in another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.
gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.
democrats have fought back against block grant medicaid proposals since the reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the affordable care act. even some key republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.
he added, there is not one shred of proof against him. it's all calumny. is that clear?
the new president was sworn in wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the u.s. faces, as he sees it.
i am excited to join facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, austin said in a statement.
it's a bit of disbelief. it's been so long. and for so many people in flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied â€” that there was never going to be this level of accountability. and as a physician in flint, i never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. there [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. and as i began to practice more in flint and interact with the families in flint, i began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. and it's been open for about seven years. and having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.
the same is true of the gardiner, says amy graham. we have language in the gardiner scholarship law that says that by participating in the gardiner program you're not allowed to have fape. you're giving that up. the state will still evaluate students, but if families take them out of the system, they are no longer eligible for services.
the primary symptoms of covid-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. some people also experience fatigue, headaches and, less frequently, diarrhea. cases can range from mild to moderate to severe. about 80 percent of cases so far seem to be mild, according to the world health organization.
if you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, and you can't get rid of it. so that's what i did, adelson told the american gaming association convention in 2014.
it will be the first and foremost the palestinian authority that will block the youth, he says, and whatever the palestinian authority cannot carry out on its own, israel will do it for them.
the two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. a third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest cnn/orc poll. the green party's jill stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.
shetamia taylor, a woman who was wounded in the dallas police attack last month, asked johnson about the black lives matter movement. and the libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.
as i was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. just so you know, we're building the wall anyway, he said to raucous applause, underneath finish the wall banners.
we are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 democratic candidate said. we are going to show the country who we are. we're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.
usually people need to sign up for part b within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to medicare rules. most people under 65 who receive social security disability benefits qualify for part b after 24 months of benefits.
the newly approved demonstration project in tennessee calls for cms to work with the state to set spending targets that will increase at a fixed amount each year.
marc lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, agrees that this is a good move. he says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.
chuck wexler, executive director of the police executive research forum, told npr the charges against off-duty officers are all the more reprehensible because many officers on duty at the capitol acted heroically that day.
better planning and incentives to increase electric vehicle use would result in significant greenhouse gas reductions for pennsylvania. that's one suggestion for cutting emissions included in the state's most recent blueprint for addressing climate change, the draft of its climate action plan released by the department of environmental protection every three years.

the comment immediately set off a backlash, with abuse victims speaking out on twitter and elsewhere, with many saying the statement echoed the skepticism and denial that had met with their claims. one victim, juan carlos cruz, replied, as if one could have taken a selfie or photo while karadima abused me and others while barros stood by.

bexar county sheriff javier salazar told ksat tv: my intent is that she never set foot in this building again.

police officers should know more than others that engaging in mob behavior is abhorrent. at a time when people are questioning police legitimacy, this isn't helpful. it's worse than that, it's despicable. it's despicable because you have 50 officers hurt and one who died. this is just unconscionable, wexler said, adding, those officers who engaged in mob behavior should be held accountable and should not be police officers. period.

there's an all-too familiar fight that takes place after horrible events like those in dallas and orlando, centered around firearms and how â€” or even whether â€” to regulate them.
if history is any indicator, though, it's likely that both states will pass gun-related legislation in the coming year.
diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.
this means we will be able to make additional investments in tenncare without reduction in services and provider cuts.
another gop delegate on the platform committee, rachel hoff, is a national security analyst with the american action forum and believe the final platform language signals that a trump administration would refuse to send lethal defensive weapons to ukraine.
a friend told ramirez about a doctor in baltimore who prescribed suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. he liked the way suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. he stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. i was still an addict, he says. it was just legal.
that story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. and it also reveals what the priorities are. after i started reporting the story, i was told that seema verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the white house, trying to get the white house to intervene on giving her her email back. i'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. and that's one of several examples i could give you from the past few weeks.
that means someone like warren buffett, who gets most of his income from stock investments, can pay a very low rate without triggering the amt, while a well-paid executive from westchester county with lots of kids probably can't.
martin: although at one point, romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. so he has changed his mind before.
anthony kuhn, byline: good morning, david.
ashrawi: they know that they cannot make any moves, or they cannot launch any kind of peace initiative if they want one without addressing the palestinian question and talking to the palestinian political leadership. and i think they will sooner or later. right now, i think they're feeling their way. they're not sure. i'd much rather they study the file, they study the case before they jump to conclusions.
simon: mr. preble - mr. preble, sorry.
green, a former national security council senior director for asia, says the trump administration could increase the u.s. navy's presence in the south china sea and the frequency of patrols â€” strategies the obama administration pursued, but only to a limited degree.

indiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and gov. eric holcomb is expected to sign it. starting in july, coroners will have to run toxicology screens and report the results to the state health department. the state will also help cover the added costs.
president trump wants to see israel and the palestinians reach a peace deal.

then there are what harvard business school professor and co-author of the prosperity paradox clayton christensen calls market-creating innovations. christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. but outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.
if there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that biden struck. gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of donald trump. instead, america saw a staid and humble president biden. instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.
my head's been in the sand on this. i think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up, johnson said. this discrimination does exist.

the state department itself is now investigating the possible surveillance of yovanovitch, who during testimony before house impeachment investigators in november said she had felt threatened by trump. before her recall, yovanovitch had been accused of disloyalty by allies of the white house, and during his now-infamous july 25 call with ukraine's president volodymyr zelenskiy, trump said of yovanovitch, she's going to go through some things.

this is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. and the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program, pompeo said in reference to the international agreement signed by iran, the u.s., the united kingdom, china, france, germany, russia and the european union in 2015. it was a certainty. it might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. this administration has pulled the band-aid off.
moafaq tarif: (through interpreter) despite our unquestioned loyalty to the country, the country does not see us as equal.
but i do think, terry, we will look back on wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the united states really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by tom hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the national basketball association suspending its season; here in d.c., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. a lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the united states.
