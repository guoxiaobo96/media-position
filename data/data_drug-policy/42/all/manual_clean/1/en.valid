the dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.

our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.

diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.

margaret brennan: mark, i mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the president prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. you can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. afghanistan, when the president had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, wall street journal came down pretty hard on him.

senator lindsey graham: i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. president obama ended the operations in iraq against sound military advice. the president's getting sound military advice about the status of the kurds--what will happen with iran if we leave too soon. and the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for re-evaluating what he's doing. he hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. and president obama never would do that. and you saw what happened when a president shuts people out. this president's not shutting people out. he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.
hancock county: a huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a new orleans spacecraft factory on wednesday to a barge that will float it up the mississippi river for testing. the recently completed core stage of nasa's space launch system, which dwarfed the hundreds of nasa and boeing employees, was to be taken to the stennis space center in hancock county, about 50 miles northeast of new orleans. space launch system rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of nasa's artemis program. the core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant carnival float from the michoud assembly center in eastern new orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. it will undergo tests at stennis ahead of the first artemis launch, planned for 2021, said tony castilleja, a systems engineer with the boeing space team. the sls core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage nasa has assembled since the apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the moon. it will be used for artemis i, a test-flight without a crew. artemis ii is to send up a crewed spacecraft. the third mission, artemis iii, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to mars.

portland: lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. the city commission unanimously voted to give the contract to rapid response bio clean on wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, oregon public broadcasting reported thursday. opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. under a modified deal, rapid response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. the workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. the city has contracted with rapid response since 2016. but in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. mayor ted wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. rapid response was to resume its work by thursday.

protecting the shield: read our investigative series
senator dick durbin: i don't see that. but i will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. the president could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. but he said, no, i'm going to shut down my own government. that's what he's done.
dan balz: that-- that is such an interesting question because i think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on president trump in 2020, and i think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. we saw in iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for elizabeth warren. i think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. i think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like elizabeth warren or vice president biden, bernie sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. but there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. and my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.

but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.

mark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.

but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.
oklahoma city: the oklahoma corporation commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including oklahoma county and oklahoma city. the commission said the north american numbering plan administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in july. starting in january 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. commission spokesman matt skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. the area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes tulsa. the commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in december 2021.

at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.

seattle: mayor jenny durkan said seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. durkan included those directives in a green new deal executive order wednesday. neither the new keyarena now under construction at seattle center nor the massive seattle aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, durkan said. that's because the projects are underway, she said. both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. the $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, durkan's office said. there's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. last year, the council passed a green new deal resolution that said seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

helena: urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. the montana fish and wildlife commission recommended the city of helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, the helena independent record reported tuesday. former police chief troy mcgee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. the program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. the commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. this will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. the city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, police chief steve hagen said. the city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

so you've reported that alex azar of health and human services and seema verma of medicare and medicaid both want to please president trump. how have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? and is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? in other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in trump's good graces?

wilmington:a record number of vehicles crossed the delaware memorial bridge from new jersey into the first state last year. in 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the delaware river and bay authority. put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. that is twice the earth's circumference, with a road trip from delaware to myrtle beach, s.c. to spare. the bridge also had a record for a month in august, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the august 2003 record by 27,000. officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. all those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. for passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from new jersey into delaware.

behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.

when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.

us federal prosecutors say honduran president juan orlando hernández helped an alleged drug trafficker deliver thousands of kilos of cocaine to the united states in exchange for hefty bribes, allegedly vowing he was going to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. court documents allege hernández and other top officials took bribes while he was running for the presidency in 2013, and in exchange offered military support and the use of the country's armed forces as security for drug-running operations. hernández has not been charged and called the claims 100% false. the honduran president in 2019 admitted he had been investigated by the us drug enforcement administration. allegations surfacing in this us drug trafficking investigation have renewed calls among hondurans for hernández's resignation.

macungie: mack trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of philadelphia, the company said wednesday. mack blamed the layoffs at its lower macungue township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. they will take effect at the end of february, the (allentown) morning call reported. the cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. we regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said mack spokesman christopher heffner. employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news wednesday. the cuts were expected after mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. mack expects the north american truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

the white house is also highlighting success stories. at the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit held in atlanta in march, obama appeared on stage with crystal oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from ohio. oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. she tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. i personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, oertle said in atlanta. i couldn't tough it out. i know some people can. i couldn't do it. this last time has been the most successful recovery for me.
mr. trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.

congressional democrats also want to reverse some of trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that republicans included in the tax cuts and jobs act. among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.
the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.

at the very least, a democratic senate should allow biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the trump era ― not just legislatively through the congressional review act, but by reshaping the national labor relations board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. the trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is deposed as the senate's leader, biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.
gross: so is there a decision, for better or worse, that redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the u.s. for better or worse?
diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
wsoc-tv: after republican 9th congressional district candidate mark harris finished addressing mecklenburg county republicans at the charlotte mecklenburg government center monday night, reporters, including eyewitness news reporter joe bruno, tried to ask him questions. harris and a group of three or four other people used a fire exit to leave the government center as reporters attempted to ask questions. after harris opened the door on the ground level, an alarm sounded. an unidentified man tried to block reporters from using the fire escape to follow harris. when questioned if he worked for the city, the man allowed reporters to pursue the politician. reporters continued to volley questions at harris after he exited through the fire escape, but he sprinted across east 3rd street and into the parking lot of the first baptist church of charlotte, where he used to be a pastor. harris then got into a car which sped off in the opposite direction of reporters. after the bizarre exit, in a tweet to eyewitness news reporter joe bruno, harris said he had to get home to watch the college football national championship game.

even with republicans out of legislative power, biden faces a potential crisis in the supreme court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the aca's constitutionality. the republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. biden and a democratic congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the aca and rendering the lawsuit moot.

honolulu: improvements in programs to address hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. state homeless coordinator scott morishige informed lawmakers tuesday that new york now holds the top position, the honolulu star-advertiser reported. morishige presented the data to the hawaii homelessness summit for both houses of the state legislature. the summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. placements of homeless people into permanent housing in hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. the state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. after trending upward from 2013 to 2016, hawaii's official point in time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. the decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, morishige said. there has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.
trenton: all 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, trenton officials said thursday. the announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the delaware river and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of ewing, hamilton, hopewell and lawrence. pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and trenton water works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to david smith, the water works chief engineer. residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, democratic mayor reed gusciora said. that's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. about 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

[ed. note: it certainly does seem unfair that the individuals responsible for the shutdown are not among those affected by the shutdown itself. shutdowns were introduced to our budgeting process as a bipartisan penalty for intransigence. nobody is supposed to want a shutdown. but as our government has lost the capacity for budgeting and other normal fiscal duties, shutdowns have become a more significant part of our experience. that's because since the 1990s, parties have considered shutdowns as political opportunities. we score these events like games: which team won and which team lost. the idea is that no one is supposed to win. a shutdown is an embarrassment and a reflection of governmental incompetence. what's obvious now is that those ideas carry less sting then they did 40 years ago when they were instituted. so maybe we need to, as you suggest, increase the pain.]

senator dick durbin: they did not cross the border. the solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. and this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.

meanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. but it's now possible for congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.

former tamaulipas governor eugenio hernandez flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the southern district of texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. the case against hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by u.s. homeland security investigations and the u.s. drug enforcement administration. … hernandez and his predecessor, tomas yarrington ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by u.s. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into texas. as breitbart texas reported, yarrington is currently in an italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the u.s. related to los zetas, the gulf, and the beltran leyva cartels.

many overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. according to ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. he estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.

columbus: gov. mike dewine has asked the state's medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. the governor's directive came after a recent report showed ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the columbus dispatch reports. dewine said he asked medicaid director maureen corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. the number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in december by the georgetown university center for children and families.

reno: an australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. the center for biological diversity filed notice in u.s. district court in las vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with ioneer usa corp. the center filed an emergency petition with the u.s. fish and wildlife service in october to list tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. the lawsuit filed weeks later accused the bureau of land management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.
at odds with the future vice president
and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.
diamond: the tom price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. and, yes, politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. and i say our because i was teamed up with my wonderful colleague rachana pradhan. alex azar has been like the forrest gump of republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, azar would pop up in so many notable moments. he clerked for conservative justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. he worked on the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton. and then he was a lawyer working on the florida recount in 2000, bush v. gore. because bush won, alex azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the bush administration, ending up as the no. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at eli lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.

diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.

a study published in the journal clinical infectious diseases in january found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in u.s. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. the study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.
the pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. two of the biggest cases against rival exxon mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in new york and massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.

senator lindsey graham: --that we don't need a wall.

but i do think, terry, we will look back on wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the united states really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by tom hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the national basketball association suspending its season; here in d.c., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. a lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the united states.

diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.

a recent analysis by the new york times reveals just one-fifth of obama-trump voters returned to the democratic party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted republican. roughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.

sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, seidle wrote. i would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. so where was the healing to take place? tell me? every day i missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. there was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that i missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. my children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' not because i left, but for her malice.

columbia: gov. henry mcmaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. the program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. mcmaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4k program to the remaining 17 districts. several are among south carolina's largest districts, including beaufort, charleston, greenville and richland district 2, according to the post and courier of charleston. mcmaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4k program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in south carolina. several senators and house members praised the republican governor's proposal. democratic sen. vincent sheheen of camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

las vegas:lincoln county authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. the lincoln county sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south nevada, officials said. authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. the herd was in the tule spring area about 30 miles north of mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, sheriff kerry lee said. the rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of december before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. the area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the lincoln county sheriff's office.

meanwhile, seema verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. but i've talked to officials who say that seema verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.

representative max rose: well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. so the key here in afghanistan, because we saw in iraq, the invasion of iraq was absolutely foolish. but then we did a speedy withdrawal, which i believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. we cannot afford to do the same thing in afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--

shutdown stories: florida prison guards pay the price - nyt: a federal prison here in florida's rural panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during hurricane michael in october, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in yazoo city, miss., more than 400 miles away. since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. as of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip. 'you add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said mike vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union. if nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in washington…

many people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. but the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. one way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.

representative mikie sherrill: you know what i would add to what max is saying, and what i think is lost a little bit in the discussion of trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. we are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and nato, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. and so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, i think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.

dana point: a baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the southern california coast. crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near salt creek beach in dana point on tuesday. capt. frank brennan aboard dana wharf's ocean adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. you could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. brennan told the orange county register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. the dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. the whales are migrating to the lagoons of baja, mexico.

diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.
senator lindsey graham: okay. here's what he's open to. he's open to getting his wall money. we need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. he has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. so how can you say he's not open minded to it. here's what i think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. and i think we can put on the table tps reform. there's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. i'd like to deal with that problem and i would--

the efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. but those might be months and months away. so in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the united states, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. there's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.

salem: lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. the u.s. department of agriculture resources conservation service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the capitol press reports. water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern oregon where the climate is drier. every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the owyhee basin in southeastern oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. the lowest totals are in the hood, sandy and lower deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the willamette basin at 26%. the water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins oct. 1 and runs through sept. 30 of the following calendar year.

how the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. the mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on congress and the white house to forge a deal in the coming days.
omaha: despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the u.s. army corps of engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive missouri river flooding. the corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from gavins point dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. the corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. until a seasonal decrease that began in november, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. areas along the missouri river and its tributaries in parts of nebraska, kansas, iowa and missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. john remus, chief of the corps' missouri river management, told the omaha world-herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the national weather service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in january and february. the corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, remus told the associated press on wednesday. once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, remus said, limiting its capacity.

montpelier: the number of fatalities on vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. vermont state police and the vermont agency of transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the times argus reported. but state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. lt. tara thomas, commander of safety programs for the vermont state police, said the reduction was unexplainable. thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. we wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. that's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. we're averaging just way too many each month, she said. the 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. the figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

but overspending is in the eye of the beholder. at their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (discretionary spending is money over which congress has direct control, unlike social security or medicare, for example.) as a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.

mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.

diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.

and then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. the president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that europe is now a source of america's problems. on one level, he's right; the virus came out of china, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. i think the trump administration did have good reason to shut down china travel in late january, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.

st. louis: gov. mike parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. the st. louis post-dispatch reports that parson, the former polk county sheriff, said he is monitoring a platte county court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. the video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. but backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. the governor's stance is in contrast to the missouri state highway patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.
insecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the northern triangle countries of el salvador, guatemala, and honduras. homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting central americans to flee.
what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.

and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.

annapolis: a newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. the capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. in contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. that process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. the newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. in the case of the man accused of opening fire in the annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.

biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.

chapel hill: the university of north carolina board of governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. dth media corp., which publishes the daily tar heel student newspaper on the unc-chapel hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the board of governors and the state chapter of the sons of confederate veterans, news outlets reported on wednesday. the deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. unc-chapel hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. superior court judge allen baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. baddour approved an agreement on nov. 27 in which the scv agreed to take ownership of the silent sam statue and build a center to preserve it. the statue stood for more than a century on the chapel hill campus before protesters took it down in august 2018. the university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. in addition, unc-chapel hill paid the scv about $75,000 not to display confederate flags or similar banners on any unc system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

jefferson city: republican gov. mike parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by democratic challenger nicole galloway. those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. there are no limits on donations to pacs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. a pac backing parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers october through december. uniting missouri pac chairman john hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping parson in the gubernatorial race. a pro-galloway pac has not yet reported recent fundraising. the general election is nov. 3.
most states have adopted centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. but states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.

des moines: to keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, des moines international airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said monday. the extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. the airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. but because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.

senator lindsey graham: dick durbin is a good guy. he's a reasonable guy. but nancy pelosi has made progress. she's gone from not a penny to a dollar. nancy pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. president trump sees it as real. until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. the president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. it will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. and every plan i've supported in the past with dick durbin has had money for physical barriers--

jackson: prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. the southern poverty law center and other groups said they were sending the letter tuesday to the u.s. department of justice. the letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. u.s. rep bennie thompson, mississippi's only democrat in congress, called sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.
minneapolis:two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the minnesota constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. the proposal comes from alan page, a former minnesota supreme court justice, and neel kashkari, president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. they want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the star tribune reported wednesday. page and kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. even though minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. courts have interpreted the minnesota constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. page and kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. page and kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. to amend the minnesota constitution, they will need the legislature's approval to put the question to voters. the two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. but they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, education minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

trump transformed the supreme court with three new justices, the most named by any president since ronald reagan. progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal stephen breyer, the oldest supreme court justice at 82, to retire as soon as biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late justice ruth bader ginsburg. if breyer does step down, biden is expected to nominate the first black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.
we begin today with senate democratic whip dick durbin who is in springfield, illinois. senator durbin is among a group of senators talking to the white house about how to end this shutdown. senator, welcome to face the nation. the president said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. if he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will senate democrats do?
pelosi responded: president trump must stop holding the american people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.
the ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive democrat districts. bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. let's just remember the election is nine months off, bustos said. we want to make sure that going into november 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.

marc lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, agrees that this is a good move. he says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.
the department last week sent pre-termination letters to detective myles cosgrove, who an fbi analysis determined fired the shot that killed taylor, and detective josh jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at taylor's louisville home. in the letter to jaynes obtained by cbs news, interim police chief yvette gentry said jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a u.s. postal inspector that taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at taylor's home.
bustos also said after he dropped out, beto o'rourke reached out to the dccc offering his help if needed. the dccc themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as senators kamala harris and cory booker and secretary julian castro, about potential involvement in the house election cycle. where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
another officer who opened fire, brett hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into taylor's apartment from outside. he was charged criminally with endangering taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. no one has been charged in taylor's death. kentucky attorney general daniel cameron said cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, sergeant jon mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by walker.

midland: it's not what the egyptians had in mind, but it worked: a group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. it took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at bullock creek high school in midland county. they are hoping to be recognized by the guinness book of world records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. there was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, maxton herst told mlive.com. every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. it was just kind of mind-numbing work. herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on youtube. the students built the pyramid during holiday break. rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.

charleston: the department of natural resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. a long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, jim hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the charleston gazette-mail. when the drought broke in october, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. but winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, hedrick said. the growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. the division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for january stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.

chicago: o'hare and midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. the cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in illinois. the boxes are located just past the airports' transportation security administration checkpoints, the chicago tribune reported. although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, chicago police department spokeswoman maggie huynh said. the boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. the boxes are owned by the department of aviation and serviced by the police. police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, huynh said. illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.
shannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.

new york: the country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor monday. gov. andrew cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of penn station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. more than 600,000 people pass through penn station daily on trains run by amtrak, new jersey transit and the metropolitan transportation authority, operator of the long island rail road and the new york city subway system. the station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. the more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.

aca fixes: if there's a way for trump and the republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the aca in 2017. the administration stopped paying cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.
a friend told ramirez about a doctor in baltimore who prescribed suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. he liked the way suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. he stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. i was still an addict, he says. it was just legal.

a democratic majority in the senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. the federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. with democrats holding the house, the senate and the white house, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.
bustos, a democrat from a district won by mr. trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of democrats she says have compelling arguments. they've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. cindy axne's done 57 town hall meetings, joe cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…lauren underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. when you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. and i think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.

dan diamond: well, terry, i guess we can start with the good, such as it was. on wednesday night, nearly two months after the first u.s. case of novel coronavirus was detected, president trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. he's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. he has posted tweets, even on monday where he compared this to the flu. this is not the flu. the flu does not lead the national basketball association, the nba, to suspend its season.

good morning and welcome to face the nation. top white house officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. so far their talks have yielded nothing. yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. with no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.

trenton: the state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. the measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. the bill was approved by two assembly committees monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. to achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. at the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.

my attitude did not change after i began working in a mine closer to home just outside clintwood, va. the company i worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. but the problem was still apparent. we would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
senator dick durbin: i can just tell you, i don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, i'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.
seidle found fault in how many people treated him. he said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.

topeka: democratic gov. laura kelly proposed monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the republican-controlled legislature spiked last year. kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. the move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. but it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. the kansas public employee retirement system projects kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

providence: legislative leaders said wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. a provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. democratic gov. gina raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. democratic house speaker nicholas mattiello and senate president dominick ruggerio said wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. however, they still took issue with how the department of business regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. the legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

senator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.

galveston: remains found on a tiny south pacific island where a bloody world war ii battle happened have been identified as those of a missing marine from galveston, a federal agency said wednesday. in a statement, the defense pow/mia accounting agency announced that the remains of 1st lt. justin g. mills of galveston, texas, had been identified. the remains were found in 2015 on the island of betio in the tarawa atoll of the gilbert islands. the remains were turned over to the dpaa laboratory for genetic identification. mills had been missing since the november 1943 battle for tarawa, which left about 1,000 u.s. marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. the dpaa said mills died on the battle's first day. mills is to be buried april 29 at arlington national cemetery in virginia.

wichita: an animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. the wichita animal action league said in a facebook post that the pit bull was found wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. he is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.the post described the dog as very sweet and loving. the group is asking for donations for his medical care. the post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. it will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. wichita officer charley davidson said an investigation is underway.

denver: an initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the november ballot. the secretary of state's office said monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. the gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of u.s. states. it was eradicated in colorado in the 1940s. colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. the rocky mountain wolf action fund is campaigning for the plan. it says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. if passed, the initiative would direct the colorado parks and wildlife commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the continental divide before 2024.

killingly: the killingly board of education voted to bring back a controversial native american-themed athletic mascot. the board decided to reinstate the redmen mascot at a meeting wednesday, the norwich bulletin reported. in october, the same board approved the new red hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at killingly high school. several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. it featured the profile of a native american man wearing a headdress. newly elected republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. the board, with a republican majority, held a public meeting on dec. 11 where it voted to remove the red hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. more than a dozen people, including students and native american representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. they also sought some other compromise, the bulletin reported. at the wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray native americans in a negative stereotype.

town: a man from illinois drove through wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. tommy mecher, an electrician apprentice from chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. i only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, mecher said. i put it on the roof in lemont, illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to bessemer, michigan. snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. there's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. but mecher purchased the 1990 polaris indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in bessemer last friday. mecher said it took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 chevy malibu, using an old blue ford tractor with a bucket. he modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. he secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

jackson: foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in grand teton national park. park officials closed a large area of the teton range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. grand teton spokeswoman denise germann said another attempt could take place in late january or early february. mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. the national park service has contracted oregon-based baker aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the jackson hole news & guide reported. wintry weather kept baker from making it to the area, germann said. park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
the chief thought the answer was to punish me, seidle said. you know, if i forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that i was under stress and i was just having trouble coping. having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. and he knew that, he knew that.

senator dick durbin (minority whip/@senatordurbin/d-illinois): well, i can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. this is the first president in history who shut down his own government. unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. as of next friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. this is totally unnecessary. and that's a point we've made over and over to this president, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for america.

st. george: more than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern utah, federal officials said. the proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. the bureau of land management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, the spectrum newspaper reported wednesday. blm is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, venhuizen said. details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. the draft is the first step in the year-long national environmental policy act, officials said. the utah division of transportation and washington county proposed building the northern corridor that would pass through the red cliffs national conservation area, officials said. a definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. after the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. a decision is expected by 2021.

some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. they point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.

but it seemed as if the guardrails of our democracy — congress, the courts, the states, the media, the cabinet — were keeping things within bounds. then came the past 10 days. the country is now caught in the internal maelstrom that is the mind of donald trump. we are in the realm of the id. chaos reigns. no guardrails can hold. – charles krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the washington post on may 18, 2017.

senator dick durbin: well, i can't say that we're close because president's made it clear he doesn't care. he's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. it was stunning to hear a president of the united states say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. but that is his position. think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the treasury department has been shut down, the internal revenue service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.

in a previous life, i worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. they very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. that may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. it's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.

it's not yet clear which russians will go to the olympics — where they will compete as olympic athletes from russia because the country's team is formally banned. the ioc is vetting lists of athletes submitted by russian officials before issuing invitations.
those bans, which include 14 medalists, have helped clear the way for younger talent in russia, mutko said. while there would usually be about 40 percent changeover in the russian team between olympics, he said, this time 80 percent of athletes will not have competed in sochi.
diamond: well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. we're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the centers for disease control. we don't have enough supplies, like respirators. our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. and i think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in italy, in spain, with their hospitals and icus totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.

those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.

sioux falls: legislators have invited the crow creek sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual state of the tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of gov. kristi noem's cabinet. lawmakers on monday invited lester thompson jr. to deliver the address next week. the move is a switch from plans to have secretary of tribal relations dave flute give it. the annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the great sioux nation tribal address. that event will still happen in fort pierre across the missouri river from the capitol but has been rescheduled for after the state of the tribes address.

democratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.

a source close to the yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster that former vice president joe biden's campaign reached out about a deal. the rules of the iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. i frankly think i'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, yang said. in waukee today, biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former iowa governor tom vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to o'keefe.

representative max rose: well, what i just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. i believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. i don't want to see americans put at risk. i've watched loved ones get hurt. i don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. but i just want us to have a long-term strategy--
dan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.
meanwhile, alex azar has been the point person on president trump's goal of lowering drug prices. azar has pitched himself as the fixer. he worked in the drug industry at eli lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. but so far, a lot of the plans that the trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. so alex azar also hasn't been able to deliver. and that means both of them are conscious, azar and verma, of the need to show trump that they are delivering. and they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.

pence diminished - the atlantic: according to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as trump's friction with congress has increased, pence's clout has suffered. two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that pence was leading the trump administration's negotiations on border security. yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending pence to a meeting that trump himself said would yield nothing. this, coupled with the moments over the past month when trump has publicly undermined pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.

spring hill:general motors and united auto workers local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective feb. 3. the decision resolves a dispute between gm in spring hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, chairman mike herron told the daily herald on thursday. under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in october, gm agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. none of the temporary workers in spring hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. the deal between gm and local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. the company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. on monday, gm announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 uaw-represented plants across the country. ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. at gm's flint assembly in michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

tallahassee: the state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former gov. rick scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. through the first week of december, the florida department of environmental protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. by comparison, in 2010 dep assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. dep holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. but the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.

indianapolis:family members of hoosier bank robber john dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at crown hill cemetery. the lawsuit, filed in august by dillinger nephew michael c. thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by marion county superior court judge timothy oakes on dec. 4, but thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. that deadline would have been jan. 15. but on tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on thompson's behalf. it has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. it's unknown what thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. attempts to reach the thompson family and their attorney, andrea simmons, were unsuccessful. crown hill cemetery objected to plans to exhume dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. in a written statement sent to indystar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. dillinger, born in indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. his name became legend when fbi director j. edgar hoover labeled him public enemy no.

augusta: biologists with the state department of inland fisheries and wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. the study began in the winter of 2014 in western maine, and a second study area in northern maine was added in 2016. over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a gps collar. this year, the program will include a new area north of moosehead lake. the collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. for each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.

the two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by pfizer and moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. the need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.
dallas: a contempt of court charge has been dropped against the dallas county district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against dallas county district attorney john creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer amber guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by judge tammy kemp. the white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, botham jean, inside his own apartment. kemp said in an order that the interview, in which creuzot explained why he thought guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.

on friday, the global times, a communist party newspaper and usual staunch defender of the authorities, reported that many said the experience of the eight 'whistleblowers' was evidence of local authorities' incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus.
the police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation's highest court. we have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors, a posting on the court's weibo account said.

the response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.
aside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other chase cards. one of our favorites is cell phone protection. as long as you use your chase freedom flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. this is currently the only no-annual-fee chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.
the move will likely spur house democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand medicare and medicaid during the pandemic.

nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. then-sen. claire mccaskill, d-mo., in 2018 called earmarks the washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. to supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. and not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.

health officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.
the danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains angela rasmussen, a virologist at the georgetown center for global health science and security. it could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.
we really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool, dr. scott gottlieb, former commissioner of the us food and drug administration, said on cbs' face the nation.

unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out, said senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york. he asked speaker (nancy) pelosi, 'will you agree to my wall?' she said no. and he just got up and said, 'then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way, and he just walked out of the meeting.
another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from republicans, making it less likely. how much action biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what biden proposed as a candidate.
i was not a user, so they would ask me if i'd turn them in. my typical response: do what you want to do, but if i catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, i'll make sure you never work here again.
you should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. however, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. you should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. 
i hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said thursday at a town hall in decorah. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind. buttigieg then pivoted to sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors medicare for all and free college tuition at public universities.

cannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said rep. dana rohrabacher (r-calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.
that a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the trumpiest congressman in trump's washington by gq might have something to do with their ages. millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 pew poll. ocasio-cortez, 29, and gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.
he also criticized the trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.
that line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including david lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in hagerstown, md. the home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. in addition to beds, lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. the emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. it's what worked for lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.
this new year brings brings fresh choices and fresh controversies in health care. president trump and republicans tried last year to repeal the affordable care act and, when that failed, to chip away at the law in other ways. but in the end, with no legislation passed, the principal result was to galvanize a once ambivalent public.
the campaign for trauma-informed policy and practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.

the cdc, the centers for disease control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. but one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like seattle. by the time that the trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. and now as we talk in march, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.
the several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts. – james madison, federalist no. 47

while maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between sanders and biden over social security. the vermont senator has accused biden of being open to cutting social security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.
billionaire activist tom steyer does not have much of a chance in new hampshire. so he used the debate to make a strong appeal to african american voters in south carolina, where his campaign has invested heavily and black voters make up two-thirds of the primary electorate.
at the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.
meanwhile, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson notes that at a speech in newton, iowa, biden spoke about the importance of 2020 democrats focusing on mr. trump and not swinging at each other. the former vice president said we shouldn't let this democratic race slide into negative attacks. the temptation is too much for some biden added, while highlighting president obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.

mark landler: yeah. no, the president said in essence that the soviet union has been right to invade afghanistan. he offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. he said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. and-- and he also attributed the collapse of the soviet union to their misadventures in afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of soviet union. but to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, i think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing american troops from foreign conflicts. i think it's--
some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. and if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.

both ossoff and warnock have said they want to expand health insurance incrementally through broadening the affordable care act and creating a government-backed public option plan for americans, rather than overhauling the whole system with medicare-for-all or something like it.

diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.

diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.

senator lindsey graham (r-south carolina/@lindseygrahamsc): yeah. it was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. dick durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. we're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice, not support ice. we're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. as long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. the president will compromise but he will not capitulate. so that's where we're at.

many leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.

portland: the state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. patrick keliher, commissioner of the maine department of marine resources, told maine public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. that would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. the season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but maine's lobstermen finished strong, keliher said. the price for maine lobster was also strong, he said. it's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. the biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

indonesia's national search and rescue agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard sriwijaya air flight 182, which crashed into the ocean saturday shortly after taking off from jakarta. rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the boeing 737-500 , but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. the boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 max crashes. still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. in 2007, the european union banned all 51 indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.

montgomery: a judge on tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the alabama democratic party. montgomery circuit judge greg griffin scheduled the hearing for jan. 30. the hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. longtime state party leader nancy worley had filed the lawsuit to block state rep. chris england from taking control as party chair. a revamped governing board of the party elected england as chair this fall, but worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. the ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as worley and joe reed, against an upstart faction. the democratic national committee supports england and recognizes him as state chair. barry ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in worley's suit, said last month that england is functioning as party chair.

gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?

it's hard to imagine a better moment for democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. the coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of covid-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.

the trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. and the selection of a rally in el paso was no accident either — trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the u.s. border town compared to its mexican counterpart. however, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in el paso.

cnbc: house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer will deliver the democrats' response to president donald trump on tuesday night following his oval office address to the nation about funding his proposed border wall. pelosi and schumer, who have led democratic negotiations with the trump administration amid a partial government shutdown that has now become the second-longest on record, will give their response from the speaker's balcony in the u.s. capitol building after trump's televised 9 p.m. et address has finished. 'if his past statements are any indication,' then trump's speech 'will be full of malice and misinformation,' the democratic leaders said monday night in a joint statement calling for democrats to be given equal airtime. as the shutdown of roughly a quarter of the government stretched into its 18th day, both sides remained staunchly opposed to each others' proposals for a deal to fund nine federal departments.

virginia beach: an animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. the woman and the felines were found living in a virginia beach self-storage unit this week, the city's animal care and adoption center said on tuesday. the city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, animal control supervisor meghan conti told the virginian-pilot. the adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. they're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. the animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.

new orleans: john white, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as louisiana's education superintendent. he told state board of elementary and secondary education members in a letter that he will leave the job march 11. he did not state his reasons. the board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. white can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. his tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and gov. john bel edwards. and the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of white. although he didn't discuss his future, the advocate reported in april that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, propel america, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. white has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state board of elementary and secondary education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.
