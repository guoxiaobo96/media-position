Police reports show Neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the Seidles, including a custody dispute. Both Seidles and the Seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.
DIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.
In evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, Seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the Press in the summer to discuss his crime. The prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. The floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.
Sioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.
A new rule issued by the Trump administration states that consular officers who grant B-1 and B-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, must deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on U.S. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship.
In your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?

More than three years before the shooting, Tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by Seidle show. She claimed Seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. Seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. Tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.
You know, there were a lot of problems, Seidle said in a prison phone call. But we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.

Salt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men's resource center, police said.

When he started his work as a recovery advocate, Lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. Soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's Suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting Suboxone. That to me just looks like heroin, Lidz says.
Another adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.

The findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among Covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. Based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 I.C.U. patients treated early with these drugs. All of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.
Yet the end game is unclear. All signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after January 10, when Maduro begins another presidential term. Though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.

Traditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.

Fishman, the addiction doctor in Baltimore, knows there are people like Testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. But, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable.

Surely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said Jesse Bragg, the media director at the Boston-based anti-corruption group Corporate Accountability. Experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.
But lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. Last month, Congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. The federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.
Tallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. We're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don't see anything happening.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done.
A study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in U.S. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. The study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.
Lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support.

Punitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said.

We have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. Unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population.

While earmarks have been condemned as frivolous at best and corrupt at worst, research on their uses and effects paints a more complex picture of their dynamics.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I really believe that.
Instead, Congress has funded government agencies in massive omnibus appropriations bills, and partial- and full-year continuing resolutions, making it virtually impossible for members to know what they were voting for.

The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.

Wilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase Deus Vult, a Latin expression meaning God wills it, in red letters across the Newark building's exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney's release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.
That line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including David Lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in Hagerstown, Md.

It's what worked for Lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.

The only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the Senate adopted and can easily end.

We sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.

Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.
Historically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post.

At the very least, a Democratic Senate should allow Biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the Trump era ― not just legislatively through the Congressional Review Act, but by reshaping the National Labor Relations Board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. The Trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. If Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is deposed as the Senate's leader, Biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.

The president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.

Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.

The Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. Victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. Childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. Women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. Between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.

Oklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney's Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.

And Democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. That would mean getting 10 Republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?
DAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.

Trenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.

A friend told Ramirez about a doctor in Baltimore who prescribed Suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. He liked the way Suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. He stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. Still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. I was still an addict, he says. It was just legal.

Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.
GROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?

Charleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.

Congress should pass a permanent program allowing insurance companies to buy reinsurance to offset the risk of their most expensive cases.

No matter that he would be only partially fixing what he just broke.
Trump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.

So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself.

The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.
Aside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.

But the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that Trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. As another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on Capitol Hill emerged with a deal Monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's Department of Homeland Security funding bill). This will fund about 55 miles of fencing.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.

Jackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.
Biden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that Republicans enacted at the end of 2017.
Even with Republicans out of legislative power, Biden faces a potential crisis in the Supreme Court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The Republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that Congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. Biden and a Democratic Congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the ACA and rendering the lawsuit moot.

New York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.

One thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.

Nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018 called earmarks the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. To supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of Congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. And not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.
Also, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.
Biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) leading the Senate Judiciary Committee than he would have with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the helm. Since Trump and McConnell filled almost every open judicial seat that Republicans had prevented Obama from filling, Biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.

Neptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about Seidle's problems and when they knew it.
With recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into Appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. Not only has Wall Street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.
Two House millennials on opposite sides of the political spectrum have proved it's possible to find common ground, at least when it comes to cannabis policy.

Evansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including The Geography of Home, released in 2018. He's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed The Ropewalk Writers' Retreat in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.
Internal affairs expert D'Angelo reviewed the special report on the Seidle shooting issued by Prosecutor Gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.
The move will likely spur House Democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand Medicare and Medicaid during the pandemic.

In 2016, the report states that drug overdoses accounted for more deaths than suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and all forms of homicide. The number of drug overdoses skyrocketed during the past two years–doubling in 2016 because of the national opioid epidemic.

Zeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the U.S. economy, and Biden will need new legislation to do that.
Speaking Wednesday on Fox News' America's Newsroom, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language.
This firm defended Phil Seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, Edward Bertucio. He avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not outlive. Instead we negotiated aggravated manslaughter and the sentence he received was lengthy. We appealed it. We did everything we could for him. I wish him the very best.

Earning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.
Born in Munich, West Germany, Tamara Wilson-Seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. She was a cheerleader and Neptune High School homecoming queen in 1982. She coached soccer. She was a devout Catholic, serving as director of religious education for the Mother of Mercy Parish.
In overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.
A popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a Democrat in the special election for U.S. Senate in Georgia. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson reports that Reverend Ralphael Warnock, the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, announced his U.S. Senate bid Thursday in a Twitter video. Warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.
What's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but I don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in Syria we're just pulling out.
DIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.
Seidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, Tamara Wilson-Seidle on June 16, 2015, in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.

The Louisville Metro Police Department has formally fired two of the officers involved in the March police raid that killed emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor. Louisville mayor Greg Fischer confirmed the firings Wednesday and CBS News obtained copies of the termination letters.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED (D-Texas/@RepColinAllred): Well, let's be very clear. He doesn't want border security. We have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. There is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. A five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. There's a lot of things we can do instead of that.
Virginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.
Thursday Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his Super Bowl Ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in America, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.
After a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.
Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.
The investment boom that began in 2016 is fading fast, quashing the never-realistic hopes of Republicans that the corporate tax cut had permanently transformed the economy for the better.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But let's dig into that--
The U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.

Washington may have a new Congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.
DAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.
Mutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. However, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the Russian Football Union and chairman of the organizing committee for the World Cup.
Then he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well.

The Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season.

Louisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.
Another topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. The House Oversight Chairman, Elijah Cummings, said that's premature. What do you all think? Is that too soon?

I don't expect them to forgive me, he said. But I just want them to know how sorry I am.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Bring some rowboats to the Navy? We can put Trump's name on it. This is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? Let's get back to work. It's why we all ran and I know it's what the Republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. And I promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. This is not political suicide.

Lincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.
There are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.
Omissions On Death Certificates Lead To Undercounting Of Opioid Overdoses
As reality sank in for Seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from Sewall Avenue, making headlines across the region.
The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.
CNN has previously reported that six House Republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the US Capitol insurrection. It's unclear whether Watson Coleman was in the safe location with those members.
Meanwhile, Gardner said he is marshaling fellow lawmakers to oppose the new policy. A dozen senators met Tuesday in Gardner's office to talk about what we need to be doing legislatively and the direction we should be pursuing in Congress on this matter, he said.

Data compiled by the Pew Research Center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills Congress should have passed. Individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.

Many overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, Ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. According to Ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, Indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. He estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.

How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.
One thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.

ED O'KEEFE: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. We got a ways to go. Congress doesn't get back till Tuesday night, Wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. I am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.
One thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.
Former House Speaker John Boehner also came out in support of weed. The Ohio Republican was opposed while he was the speaker, but last April he took a role on the board of advisers for Acreage Holdings, a cannabis company, and has spoken at cannabis investment events.
The President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible.

Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.

DIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.
Still, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. Their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.

Democratic control of the Senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The legislation, which the Democratic-controlled House had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. The measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate Senate Democrats.

Where it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.
But at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.

But producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I-- I think so. I'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the FBI finished their investigation. I think we've got to let Mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.
What we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.

One thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.

The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.
Mexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for July 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. The Mexican Government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. Mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. President Enrique Pena Nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the September 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential US policy shifts ahead of the elections. In recent years, Mexican US-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?
He was constantly a mess over his kids, Rittman said. That's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.
The Democrat Party has never been more outside the mainstream. They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, Trump said. He criticized Democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.
The president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in U.S. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. Multiple polls also showed most Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.

So you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?
Some progressive groups have protested Ms. Raimondo's selection, arguing that the Biden administration should look to a populist Democrat instead.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Listen, Senator Graham and I could not be more different politically. He's a conservative Republican from South Carolina; I'm a progressive Democrat from Illinois. But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical.

The millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th.

But I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus.

Some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.
Speaking in an interview with Fox News conducted on the sidelines of the rally, Trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: We'll see what happens. About his push for a border wall, Trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. A wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing.

Casper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.

Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

DIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.
Last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a Michigan courtroom to describe how Larry Nassar altered their lives with his abuse. They were heard and heeded.

Many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. And their abuse, it seems, counts for little.

Tucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.

Little Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.

Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.

And then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.

Sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.

Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which crashed into the ocean Saturday shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the Boeing 737-500 , but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. The Boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 Max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 Max crashes. Still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague Indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. In 2007, the European Union banned all 51 Indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.

New Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.

Cities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.

And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back.

And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.
Madison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.

Former Tamaulipas Governor Eugenio Hernandez Flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the Southern District of Texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. The case against Hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. … Hernandez and his predecessor, Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by U.S. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into Texas. As Breitbart Texas reported, Yarrington is currently in an Italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the U.S. related to Los Zetas, the Gulf, and the Beltran Leyva Cartels.

US federal prosecutors say Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández helped an alleged drug trafficker deliver thousands of kilos of cocaine to the United States in exchange for hefty bribes, allegedly vowing he was going to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. Court documents allege Hernández and other top officials took bribes while he was running for the presidency in 2013, and in exchange offered military support and the use of the country's armed forces as security for drug-running operations. Hernández has not been charged and called the claims 100% false. The Honduran President in 2019 admitted he had been investigated by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Allegations surfacing in this US drug trafficking investigation have renewed calls among Hondurans for Hernández's resignation.

Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

Albuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season.

He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.

Des Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.

It went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, Seidle said. That's where it went wrong. It was just a continuum. There was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… I love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. More than anything in the world I cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. I wanted to be the father that I never had.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only God knows what they go through to get here. The Democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--

REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.

Boston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.

Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs.

Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.

We are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 Democratic candidate said. We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.

DIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.
Gramiccioni's report underscores a failing in New Jersey police policy.

A panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the President.
Seidle found fault in how many people treated him. He said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned Tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--

Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported
Mutko said he continues to have a key role overseeing the government's multi-billion-dollar investments in World Cup stadiums and infrastructure. Leaving the organizing committee, he said, was simply not to give any extra reason for criticism of Russia from abroad.
DIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.

The evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.
Trump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.

The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?
House Democrats also plan to pass the For The People Act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. The bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. Other bills like the Protect Our Democracy Act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as Donald Trump did, will also get a Senate hearing now.

A Democratic majority in the Senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. The federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. With Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the White House, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.

ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and I think elsewhere as well. Look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now? And-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--

With the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.

DIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.
The case bears numerous similarities to the February death of Timothy Piazza, a fraternity pledge at Penn State University who died after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol then engaging in a hazing ritual similar to the one that killed Deng. Legal experts wonder if the Pi Delta Psi case could have an impact on the Piazza case.
None of your business, he recalled Tamara saying.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: No. It-- it absolutely isn't. But we have been at war in Afghanistan now for seventeen years. To put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the United States military who were born after 9/11. And we cannot just have perpetual war. But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. We need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--
One police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the Seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.
Democrats in the Senate and the House, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.
Women in state prisons are more likely to be incarcerated for a drug or property offense (like theft) than men are. According to The Sentencing Project, 24 percent of women in state facilities have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 15 percent of male prisoners. When it comes to property crimes, 28 percent of incarcerated women have been convicted, compared to 19 percent among incarcerated men.
Medicaid cuts: Republicans failed in their attempts to cut health spending last year in various repeal bills, but that didn't stop them from going ahead with the sizable tax cuts the repeal was intended to fund. That created a $1 trillion-plus IOU. Now House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to pay it off — arguing that with less revenue coming in, it's even more important to cut spending on Medicaid and Medicare.
At least four other cruise ships, two foreign and two Japanese-operated, are headed to Japan by the end of the month, Transport Minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said, urging port authorities around the country to turn them away.
When the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after Election Day, Democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the Senate where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tie-breaking votes.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.
[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, Bannon told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.
Although planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.
More recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.

The United States has made a practice of locking up victims.
The shutdown is the country's third after lockdowns initiated in March and November, The Post's Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Ben Guarino report. Johnson said the new variant of the virus, which has so far spread to at least 30 countries, is thought to be 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible.
Judges are taking it more seriously, said Nuwer, adding that lawyers who didn't know how to bring a case against fraternities in the past now have greater understanding of how to handle such cases.
They were wise before the outbreak, Zeng was quoted as saying. The paper also cited online voices saying local authorities owe Li an apology. It quoted one posting as saying, We lost a hero. If his warning could send an alarm, the outbreak might not have continued to worsen, the posting said.
Trump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. Instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.
At least three times, the Seidle drama reached as high as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.
A Wisconsin pharmacist tried to spoil 500 doses of a coronavirus vaccine because he believed they were unsafe, according to Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol, The Post's Hannah Knowles reports . The employee of Aurora Health Care removed Moderna vaccine vials from refrigeration, seeking to sabotage the supplies, but charges are still up in the air as investigators seek to determine whether the removal of the doses hurt their viability. At least 57 people received doses that were taken out of refrigeration.
The next day, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by Tamara.

But he did not declare the situation a national emergency, stopping short of a move he's openly weighed in the past days that could secure funding but would likely face a legal challenge.
He told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. But as he was campaigning in Colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, Trump said in an interview with Denver's KUSA: I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.
Hunt described three issues with Seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a DWI case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and Tamara.
Now, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.

I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country, Trump said.
Providence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.

Indiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and Gov. Eric Holcomb is expected to sign it.

Because women have long been lumped in with male prisoners in correctional and prosecutorial planning for years, it's only recently that researchers culled data that show what's really happening to incarcerated women. Last year, the Prison Policy Initiative painted the first landscape of female incarceration. What they found was disturbing.
Over the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. A survey conducted in October by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of U.S. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. Among Republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among GOP-leaning voters younger than 40.
During their campaigns, neither Warnock nor Ossoff endorsed the Green New Deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a World War II-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. But both Georgia Democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and Warnock, a Baptist reverend, draws on a long history of Black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.

Together with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.
Seidle said he doesn't remember chasing Tamara's car through the streets of Asbury Park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. He doesn't remember running Tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. He doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.
Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
The whole rally largely stuck to Trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his State of the Union address.

It was there Deng ultimately suffered and died from a traumatic brain injury while participating in the glass ceiling, a ritual that required pledges to run through a line of fraternity brothers who shoved, pushed and tackled the aspiring members to the ground.
That creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.
Altogether, the President used the word crisis six times in his remarks, seeking to imbue a deadlocked debate over funding with a new sense of urgency.

Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.

REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, I'm from Staten Island. I have no problem with profanity, okay? Well what-- what I have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. I-- I-- I certainly object to it.

Now we enter 2018 with health care as a top concern of American voters and the ACA as popular as ever. More importantly, Americans recognize the ACA's flaws and by large margins just want them to be fixed.
DIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.

For whatever reason, this has reached a crescendo, and we're focused on it now, Jackson said. I think you will see forceful prosecutions in other jurisdictions and I think they can learn a lot from prosecutions in Pennsylvania. Universities, he said, will pay attention.
On a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. In some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said Ruhm. In the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.

MARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--
It's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.
The Affordable Care Act ― Biden's famous B.F.D. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of Americans, it needs work. Biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer Medicare for All system. A fully Democratic Congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.

In Clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. It is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement.

Boise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.
Honolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.

Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.

St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.

But Trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally O'Rourke, El Paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily Democratic city. Exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, Trump claimed that O'Rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.
The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.
This is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, Buttigieg said. The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better.

In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.

In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor's degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor's degrees.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America.
Expert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.
MARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.
Plus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card.

Aside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.
Five states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the U.S. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.
Yet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.

The acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large.

Somewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – I don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, D'Angelo said. You investigated your officer several times. If you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, I mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly.
But progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like Shell.

Paramount among these is the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. The proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former Democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the VRA in compliance with the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. That decision freed state-level Republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. Former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for Lewis.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --to that compromise you just floated there?
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. But we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.

The two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.

Health officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.
What that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.
David Frederick, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, is considered a serious enough candidate for solicitor general that the group Demand Justice singled him out as someone it would oppose in a public letter last month.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. So the key here in Afghanistan, because we saw in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq was absolutely foolish. But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--

Frederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming Biden administration. Among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing Oakland's case against five oil giants, including Shell, to move forward in the California courts were Vice President-elect Kamala Harris; Biden's secretary of state pick, Antony Blinken; his future climate diplomat, John Kerry; his choice for climate czar, Gina McCarthy; and Xavier Becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.
At some point, Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a weighted backpack, fell, struck his head and was immediately unconscious, according to police. Some fraternity members placed Deng by a fire while others searched the internet for his symptoms and tried to wake the pledge.
Hard data also show that capital spending is softening. Real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. Core capital equipment orders and shipments slowed through November, and private nonresidential construction spending has also weakened.
Honolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.
But there's less appetite for deep Medicaid cuts in the Senate and even less in the electorate. If Ryan is serious about reforming Medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. I partnered with a Republican from the first Bush administration, Gail Wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. It would be a smart move now.
The outcome of the Pi Delta Psi case could also have an impact beyond Pennsylvania, said CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson, who predicted a chilling effect on universities and fraternities nationwide.
The Trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. And the selection of a rally in El Paso was no accident either — Trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the U.S. border town compared to its Mexican counterpart. However, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in El Paso.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. It's just different political parties run-- won. If you think about what Donald Trump ran on, okay? If you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, I know. But he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect Medicare and Social Security, draining the swamp. We ran on many of those same things, the American people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. And now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.
Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
Lightning killed fewer Americans last year than any year on record, marking a steady downward trend that experts attribute to more awareness, better lightning-proof construction and fewer people working in farms and fields.

This card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.
What we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.
Trump plans to meet with congressional leaders once again in the Situation Room Wednesday afternoon, ahead of his planned trip to the southern Texas border on Thursday. But past meetings have resulted in both sides digging in, with Trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democrats saying they won't entertain the discussion until Congress passes and Trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies.

One thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.
Seidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, Hanbury wrote in November 2014.
Speaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Trump said the US could no longer accommodate immigrants who enter the country illegally and implored those who support him to contact their elected representatives.
Gentry wrote in a Dec. 30 letter to Mattingly that he had been exonerated after an investigation into whether he violated the department's use of force and de-escalation policies.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.

In a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the Senate's inaction on the House's H.R. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices.
Meanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. Doctors said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.
DIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.
Winona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year's Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena'l, based in Winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in North America.
Seidle said he was called into Hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told Seidle his daughter accused Seidle of harassing her at her job. Seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by Tamara.
On Tuesday, Trump underscored cases of Americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was murdered the day after Christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. The suspect had multiple prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that California's sanctuary laws -- which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities -- led to Singh's murder.
The number of people killed by lightning in recent years a far cry from annual lightning deaths decades ago: In the 1940s, for instance, hundreds of people were killed each year by lightning. In 1943 alone, 432 people died.
Charleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college's existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward, said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.

With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.
Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.
So it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.

In the 1940s, there were many, many more small farmers who were out working in fields, which meant many more chances to be struck by lightning, Jensenius said.
Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.
In addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)
And I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.
The message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.
Local law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the Seidle household.
We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, Buttigieg said. We have to be ready to turn the page.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Dick Durbin is a good guy. He's a reasonable guy. But Nancy Pelosi has made progress. She's gone from not a penny to a dollar. Nancy Pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. President Trump sees it as real. Until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. The President is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. It will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. And every plan I've supported in the past with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers--

Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair's marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.

I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.

What we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up.

He castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.
What has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important.
Pay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.
DIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.
After two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, Seidle wrote in an online message. You continue trying, but nothing works. Everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. Then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. Then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. Perhaps you take it lightly? Maybe you think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.
Westport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That's why I'm so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting, Haskell said.
You tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.
Diana Evans is a professor of political science at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. This was first published by The Conversation — The 'gateway drug to corruption and overspending' is returning to Congress – but are earmarks really that bad?
In order to loosen the backlog, California plans to use Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Padres Stadium in San Diego and CalExpo in Sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and Newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.
Pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.
With most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday. In England, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.
DIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.
Sessions's directive, issued last week, overturns an Obama-era policy discouraging federal enforcement in states where marijuana is legal. The attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.
Seidle was stern with Rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, Rittman recalled. He was supportive of Rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.
Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.
But overspending is in the eye of the beholder. At their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (Discretionary spending is money over which Congress has direct control, unlike Social Security or Medicare, for example.) As a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that Democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.
He is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in Venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. Life there is chaotic in every sense. I hope to get him medicine in Colombia. But without government change, there is no going home.

New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.
The Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.

MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?
Director Coats also addressed the massive migration of people from Central American and attributed this crisis to gang-related violence, particularly in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.
The impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.
We begin today with Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin who is in Springfield, Illinois. Senator Durbin is among a group of senators talking to the White House about how to end this shutdown. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. The President said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. If he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will Senate Democrats do?

The ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive Democrat districts. Bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. Let's just remember the election is nine months off, Bustos said. We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.
Earmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.
The response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.
The department last week sent pre-termination letters to Detective Myles Cosgrove, who an FBI analysis determined fired the shot that killed Taylor, and Detective Josh Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at Taylor's Louisville home. In the letter to Jaynes obtained by CBS News, Interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry said Jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a U.S. Postal Inspector that Taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at Taylor's home.
Bustos also said after he dropped out, Beto O'Rourke reached out to the DCCC offering his help if needed. The DCCC themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro, about potential involvement in the House election cycle. Where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
Another officer who opened fire, Brett Hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment from outside. He was charged criminally with endangering Taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. No one has been charged in Taylor's death. Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said Cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, Sergeant Jon Mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by Walker.
Yet even incremental health coverage expansion won't necessarily be possible in the Senate, even if Ossoff and Warnock win.
GROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.

Presidential elections, including those in Mexico and Colombia, will occur at a time when support for political parties and governing institutions is at record lows and could bolster the appeal of outsider candidates, the report states.
Neptune Capt. Fisher pleaded with Seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. Fisher had worked with Seidle for years. Seidle said Fisher had seen him cry.
Why it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.
The thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? He said. Why is she constantly calling the police? Why does she continue to call the police for these matters?
In legal testimony, Hunt said he became aware of Seidle's issues before the shooting.
St. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor's stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.
Experts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).

The morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle said he drove past the family's house. He had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on Father's Day.
SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.
One thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.

KEVIN MCCARTHY: Nancy Pelosi, I extend to you this gavel.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?
In one incident about 11 months before the shooting, Seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the Ocean Grove boardwalk. He said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. He told the Press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.
What Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project. Frederick is selling to Shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.
Less than four months before the shooting, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.
Plus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.
He planned to leave in January 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. But in October 2010, Tamara told him she had breast cancer.

As the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, Lipsitch says.
And then came more calls to the police.
Federal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. Earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that X amount of money must be spent on Y project.
We don't have a public health infrastructure for mass vaccination, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.
Other professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various NGO and UN bodies are endeavoring to address.
Bustos, a Democrat from a district won by Mr. Trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of Democrats she says have compelling arguments. They've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. Cindy Axne's done 57 town hall meetings, Joe Cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…Lauren Underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. When you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. And I think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.
Tamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the Press, but the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office ignored them in its final report.
New York confirmed its first case of the new U.K. strain on Monday. The case was identified in a 60-year-old man who had no recent travel history and comes after cases have also been identified in California, Florida and Colorado.
As of Monday morning, 35.3% of doses distributed had been administered, compared with 30.2% on Friday.

Japan on Friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland China rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.
The Georgia Department of Public Health launched a Covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the CDC Covid Data Tracker.
And now House Democrats have tweaked rules around paying for legislation, potentially making it easier for their members to pass bills if they can be reasonably seen as related to the coronavirus pandemic or climate change.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?
That declaration was for the civil suit, Seidle wrote. And basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. They cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. I think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the Attorney General's Office allowed it.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.
The 60 second spot, titled George, will air Sunday February 2 during Super Bowl LIV. It features the story of Calandrian Simpson Kemp, a mother whose son, George Kemp Jr., was shot and killed in 2013.
The chief thought the answer was to punish me, Seidle said. You know, if I forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish Phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that I was under stress and I was just having trouble coping. Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.

I believe that God forgives us for all of our sins, especially when we ask him, he said. And I think that one day, you know, I will have the opportunity to tell Tamara, hopefully, how sorry I am for what I did to her.
Seidle helped Tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. Seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with Tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.
Our hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the people in the room are your colleague Senator Durbin along with--
Serious proposals from both sides should be listened to. Republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. Democrats want to address drug costs. But instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting Medicaid and the ACA to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.
He also criticized the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step.
Seidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it just a matter of semantics here? Border fence, some kind of barrier? I mean is there movement for Democrats to support what the President in some way is asking for?
MARGARET BRENNAN: That DACA and TPS for a wall?
The week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended Tamara's Catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. The children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing Seidle and responding to the shooting. A notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. Neptune, Asbury Park and Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.
Her killing shocked those in the community who knew Seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of Catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.
The Bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the NFC North with a 3-13 record. They got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. The Democratic whip, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas.
The Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.
I think I'm just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year, said Long, who is recovering from ankle surgery and will undergo a less invasive shoulder operation. I'm going to look like the Christmas Story kid. It'll be summer months, I'll be in like three North Face (jackets). But, yeah, honestly, it's football. It's a tortured existence from a physical standpoint.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And all of that requires working with a Republican Senate--
A progressive Democrat could wield the powers of the Commerce Department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.
Businesses invest when they believe demand for their products will rise. Right now, fewer companies are confident of that future revenue. Most of the leading indicators of demand are slumping as the new year begins.
While Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the U.S. government remains shuttered for the third week. President Trump warns it could last months or years and Democrats dig in.

Just emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. And I just broke down and just, I don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.
WARREN DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR BREAKING THROUGH
Meanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.
Our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. But it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. It disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. All victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.
Unfortunately, the government shutdown means this key data isn't being reported or collected. It's never a good time to fly blind, doubly so now.

Beijing has complained that the U.S. was flying its citizens out of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China.
My interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. Prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. Senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.
DIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.

There are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority.

Another piece of legislation proposed and debated by Democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.

Methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids.

Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

In the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall.

Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America.

Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.

New York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.

Santa Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.

When the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.
In some places, death investigators don't list substances on a death certificate because they haven't tested for them. Brad Ray, a policy researcher at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said toxicology reports cost hundreds of dollars each, which could strain county budgets.
And the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.

Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.

Reno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.

The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.

Augusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.

Providence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.
But in Massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: Deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws Congress has already passed, and that I will not do.
Trump transformed the Supreme Court with three new justices, the most named by any president since Ronald Reagan. Progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal Stephen Breyer, the oldest Supreme Court justice at 82, to retire as soon as Biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. Democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If Breyer does step down, Biden is expected to nominate the first Black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.
A year ago, Republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.

In some states such as Indiana, independent county coroners investigate deaths. Coroners are usually elected, and they aren't necessarily medical professionals. Other states, though, have medical examiners, who are doctors. Some even have a chief medical examiner who oversees death investigations for the whole state.
Many people surrounding the Seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the Seidle children in the lawsuit, the Seidles' priest, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton, the Seidles' divorce attorneys, the Neptune police chief, and former police director.

Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.

The efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. There's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.

Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.
Three Republicans supported the Democrats' rules, including Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York Reps. John Katko and Tom Reed. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and California Rep. Ro Khanna voted against the rules package.

DIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
These days, Seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. He is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to inmates, collecting their trash after dinner, picking up their laundry. He takes an antidepressant. He gets recreation time with other inmates, indoors, separated in individual cages with a port through which they can play cards or chess.
Hanbury wrote in May 2014 that Seidle's issues with Tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. Hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for Seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current Neptune Police Chief James Hunt.
For those issues, Seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, Hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. Seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.

On Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.
ACA fixes: If there's a way for Trump and the Republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the ACA in 2017. The administration stopped paying Cost-Sharing Reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.

John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of Britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.

Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.
But there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward Democrats than Republicans.

Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.
Some residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls.

At the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.

Following an online uproar over the government's treatment of Dr. Li Wenliang, 34, the ruling Communist Party said it was sending an investigation team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case.
Mr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.

If President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR.

But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.

Topeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

So far, the IOC says it has cut a preliminary list of 500 down to 389, but hasn't revealed names.
Outside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, Democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. They've mostly played defense against Trump and congressional Republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.

A source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
We send that off to a toxicology lab to be tested for what we call drugs of abuse, said Alfie Ballew, deputy coroner. The results often include drugs such as cocaine, heroin, fentanyl or prescription pharmaceuticals.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, what I just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. I believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. I don't want to see Americans put at risk. I've watched loved ones get hurt. I don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. But I just want us to have a long-term strategy--
DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.
The continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said Morgan Stanley economist Molly Wharton in a note to clients.

There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.
Another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from Republicans, making it less likely. How much action Biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. Expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what Biden proposed as a candidate.
The president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.
The purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.
The late Sen. John McCain, for example, called earmarks the gateway drug to corruption and overspending.
Given that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. Earmarks could help endangered Democrats shore up their support among voters back home.
We bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, Warren said. We're the Democrats. We should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well.
The depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just Latin America - with little end in sight. It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Chavarriaga told Tinton Falls police she suspected Tamara once flattened four tires on Chavarriaga's car because of who Chavarriaga was dating, according to a December 2011 report. But Tamara denied it and Chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.
The highest number of lightning deaths occurred in Florida, which recorded five fatalities. Alabama followed with three and Colorado, Texas and North Carolina had two each. The other two lightning deaths occurred in Ohio and Puerto Rico. All but one of the victims were male. On average, 79% of lightning victims are male, based on data from 2006 to 2016.
Democrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.
This is the approach advocated by Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Democrats. Yet the Republicans spent the last two months pummeling Ossoff and Warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as Medicare-for-all proponents.
DIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.

Normally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. This requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.
During roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). Women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. Eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.
A national fraternity and four men are expected to be sentenced Monday for charges related to the 2013 hazing death of Baruch College student and fraternity pledge Chun Michael Deng. Experts say the punishment could influence other cases that involve hazing deaths.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer.
One thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.

With the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. I think some campaigns have reached out to our team, Andrew Yang told reporters at an event yesterday, CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reported.

For instance, IHS Markit is predicting that U.S. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the IMF and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.
Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.
The Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.

MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Three days before the critical New Hampshire Primary, seven Democratic presidential candidates debated, with many of them fighting to survive in the race to challenge President Donald Trump.
Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials or ASTHO, calls the Biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. The big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.
With four days to go until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

As of Monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.
Jail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: Sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. The remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. In 2016, the Vera Institute of Justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.
Seidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.
To date, the U.S. Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled that the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic American citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.

It first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News. People don't leave their children behind because they want to. It is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in Venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
DIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the White House, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among Democrats, right? They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?

Portland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.

Since 2018, many have argued for a return to earmarking to grease the wheels for appropriations bills. Pro-earmark arguments have come from members of Congress of both parties and President Donald Trump.
Atlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.
Marion County's Ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. Her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.

Purchase protection and extended warranty coverage.
My attitude did not change after I began working in a mine closer to home just outside Clintwood, Va. The company I worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. But the problem was still apparent. We would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
The Press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how Seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.

The industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, Harold Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who served as legal adviser to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told Inside Climate News. The taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. The companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.
Bank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.

Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.

Midland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.

Great Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.
Despite trouble at home, Seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. He was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.

Seidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. His .40-caliber Glock, though, was returned to him. It was the weapon he used to gun down Tamara.
One thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.

Baltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.
So how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.
Wichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.

Now, following the 2020 election, House Democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland announced on Nov. 20 that the Appropriations Committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.
0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).
One thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.
The Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.
But Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).
Efforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: Congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.
Facts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.
Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.

Wellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.
Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. He issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. But that report excluded the Seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove Seidle to kill.

Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.
DIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.

I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind. Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors Medicare for All and free college tuition at public universities.
San Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global's Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.
In his 22-year career, Seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.

Chicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.
That a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the Trumpiest congressman in Trump's Washington by GQ might have something to do with their ages. Millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 Pew poll. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and Gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.
Biden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse Trump's immigration policies, but Democratic control of Congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform.
Many people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. But the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as Nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. One way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the Nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.

The pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting Shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. Two of the biggest cases against rival Exxon Mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in New York and Massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.

Hayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff's death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an aggressive manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson's black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.

Meanwhile, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes that at a speech in Newton, Iowa, Biden spoke about the importance of 2020 Democrats focusing on Mr. Trump and not swinging at each other. The former vice president said we shouldn't let this Democratic race slide into negative attacks. The temptation is too much for some Biden added, while highlighting President Obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.

Behind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.
MARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't.

Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.
West Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.
Meanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. But it's now possible for Congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. Biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.

The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama's work, One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection, will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two Infinity Mirror rooms, including Kusama's 1965 installation Phalli's Field and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture Flower Overcoat will also be part of One with Eternity. The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.

Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.

Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.

He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start.

Atlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.

U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.
Montpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets for the chance to win the right to destroy the village. Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year's raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.

In a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.
In a refrigerator in the coroner's office in Marion County, Ind., rows of vials await testing. They contain blood, urine and vitreous, the fluid collected from inside a human eye.
The argument prompted an Asbury Park police response, according to Seidle. He provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date Seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. The city denied having access to the document.

There will still be pushback from conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that Congress considered. Manchin, Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) voted against a resolution in March 2019 outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Newly elected Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.
The Biden transition team, which is expected to announce its Justice Department picks sometime after Tuesday's closely watched Senate runoff elections in Georgia, did not respond to questions about Frederick's candidacy.
Within a year of his hire, the department knew about Seidle's trouble at home. In March 1994, Seidle called Neptune police after Tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. But then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither Seidle nor Tamara filed a criminal complaint.
I've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says Michael Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. We wouldn't do that with any other disease. If one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.
In addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.
The quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. Republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in December, and they expired on Jan. 1.

I want to go to the playoffs, Long said. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin' playoff game in Chicago — can you imagine that?
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at.
Congressional Democrats also want to reverse some of Trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that Republicans included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which Democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.
Harrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.

If Trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight Saturday — though Trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.
Annapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.
The United Kingdom has already announced it will prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose of an authorized vaccine, even if it means delaying the booster shot. Limited data suggests the first vaccine dose may offer partial protection, and some prominent public health officials argue it's worth taking the risk to stem the spread of the virus.
While the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of Tamara Seidle. Philip Seidle did, Gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. With hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented Seidle from brutally killing Tamara Seidle on that fateful day in Asbury Park. It's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.
In addition to better lightning safety awareness and medical advances, all phones were corded decades ago, leading to quite a few deaths due to people speaking on the phone. Additionally, there has been better lightning protection, suppression and grounding in electrical and phone lines, he said.
Manchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.

Many leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th Amendment was ratified.
In addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)

Also, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.
But in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects. Yet he's also fretted that failing to deliver on the border wall – his chief campaign vow – would hurt him with his conservative base.
In the termination letter, Gentry cited Cosgrove's statements to internal investigators in which he described seeing a distorted shadowy mass and flashes of big light.

We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--

Denver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.
Standards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. As a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. The country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in February in the journal Addiction.
The sharp drop in lightning deaths over the past 75 years  coincides with a shift in population from rural to urban regions, wrote meteorologist Ronald Holle in an article in the Journal of Applied Meteorology.

It's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'Sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said Marco Simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. This is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'Oh, murder is not illegal.'
The rule will codify in federal statute a requirement that B visa-holders prove they can pay the full costs associated with any medical treatment they are seeking in the U.S. As opposed to current policy, consular officers will be ordered to presume that a pregnant national seeking a B visa is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child.
DIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.

The Dignity Act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. Even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the Dignity Act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. While the Dignity Act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.

Charleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state's U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.
Bismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.

We're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?

A flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon Mobil Corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. Three years later, the Dutch publication De Correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after Shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.
(CNN) The US set a grim milestone Monday as the country recorded over 200,000 new Covid-19 cases for seven straight days, according to John Hopkins University.
How the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. The mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on Congress and the White House to forge a deal in the coming days.

I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
But I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.

Washington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.

Insecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting Central Americans to flee.
There's new hope of passing COVID-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, K-12 schools and universities. Biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. There's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year.
The partnerships in Laredo between the United States Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Laredo Police Department continue to show results in disrupting criminal organizations from operating in South Texas. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prosecute those responsible and prevent individuals from being subjected to deplorable conditions, Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said in a written statement.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. I mean, Senator Warren was the first-- second to do it actually, Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary, was the first before Christmas, and will make it official next weekend. But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.

Biden's Plan To Release More Vaccine Is A Gamble. Is It Worth The Risk?
Despite setting their own off-year record, the Republican campaign arm was outraised by the DCCC by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable Democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. Two such members, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Anthony Brindisi of New York, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside Republican groups about impeachment.
GROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?

Protecting the ACA is but a preliminary step. Biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like HealthCare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. Biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. And he has called for lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a Democratic majority makes possible.

Those views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.
How fitting is it that President Trump's first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

Salem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.

We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.

I carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --on Friday with the President.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been speculation and-- and our next guest, Senator Lindsey Graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for DACA, sort of, a trade here. The President stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on DACA before he comes to any kind of proposal here. Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?
Trump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.

Tuesday night's primetime address saw both camps drifting even further apart, with Trump declaring a humanitarian and security crisis and vowing to protect America, so help me God – and Democratic congressional leaders saying Trump is working to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.
Many of those I worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. They had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. Those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. In many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.

Though Republicans like Gaetz might be rare in Congress now, should his party continue to evolve on cannabis policy, issues like medical marijuana, the war on drugs and legalization could one day become more bipartisan.
Chicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.
Gaetz represents the shift in his party. In 2018, he and Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts teamed up on legislation that would require the Veterans Affairs Department to survey veterans on marijuana use and protect the benefits of veterans who disclose their marijuana use to VA doctors.
The prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which Tamara reported to police that Seidle was harassing her, then Seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.

I think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.

The raid was linked to a drug investigation into the ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, who did not live there. Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, said police did not announce themselves before they battered in the door and he fired a shot because he feared someone was trying to break in. Three officers including Cosgrove returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were found in the home.
Some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.
Fischer said Shields stepped down from her position in Atlanta so the community there could heal, and described her as a leader committed to reform.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January.

Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.
CNN's Sara Ganim contributed to this report.
And in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, Trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by Democrat Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with Democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a White House bid that could especially challenge Trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a Southern border wall.

An even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. This means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. In addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.
Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

I think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says.

Whether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.
