Half of the blue-collar migrants who openly crossed the southern border between 2014 and 2019 remain in the United States, according to March 2020 data posted by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAgents registered 3.5 million arrivals and sent 1.8 million back home via deportations and repatriations by March 2020, said the December 31 report. The report did not include data about the additional migrants who successfully sneaked through the border.\n\nBut 280,000 of the 3.5 million were provided relief, so allowing them to stay in the United States and eventually get green cards.\n\nThat means one in 12 blue-collar migrants get the colossal prize of U.S. residency and citizenship for themselves and all of their descendants — in exchange for surviving the U.S. government's semi-formal obstacle course of cartels and coyotes, distance and bribes, judges and lawyers, deserts, walls, and border agents.\n\nMoreover, another 1.4 million blue-collar migrants are still living in the United States, mostly while they are waiting for a final court decision, said the report, titled Fiscal Year 2020 Enforcement Lifecycle Report.\n\nMany of those 1.4 million not-deported migrants take jobs from U.S. employers. The imported labor reduces the marketplace pressure on employers to compete for American workers with offers of higher wages, better working conditions, and more investment in labor-saving machinery.\n\nAmid enthusiastic sympathy from white-collar progressives, the migrants hold down Americans' blue-collar wages while also nudging up rents, and they crowd into the K-12 schools needed by the children of blue-collar Americans.\n\nCitizenship is the first prize in the migration obstacle course, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. But, he added, everybody who gets in wins something. He continued:\n\nIf you get in, and can live and work here for a while — even if you ultimately lose, and even if you're taken into custody and sent home — you've still gotten a year or two or three years of ability to live in the United States, to work here, and to establish the connections and networks that lead to future migration.\n\nOnly the migrants who get sent home immediately don't get anything, he said:\n\nSome people lose if they mortgaged their little farm or home to pay the smuggler and are turned around immediately (before they can get a U.S. job to repay the loan), or if they're victimized during the trip. That's a real loss. No question about it, a real cost.\n\nMost white-collar migrants arrive via the visa worker obstacle course. They include the roughly one million H-1B workers and spouses used by Silicon Valley companies and other firms, the J-1 workers at universities and healthcare chains, and the OPT workers used in the outsourced software sweatshops at the bottom of the Fortune 500's labor pyramid.\n\nThe DHS data shows that 1.8 million southern border migrants were repatriated from 2014 to March 2020.\n\nBut the DHS data does not show how many of those deported migrants were deported on arrival without being released into the job market.\n\nImmigration officers sent 840,000 migrants home via expedited processing. Another 600,000 were sent home because they had been deported previously — dubbed reinstatement of removal — and 240,000 other arrivals were sent home as returns because they had faced incomplete deportation charges in prior years.\n\nThe data also shows that 300,000 migrants have been given a Final Order to go home — but have not returned home. That number includes roughly 76,000 people who skipped out on their court hearings. Many of those illegals hold jobs in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, much to the disadvantage of lower-skilled and younger Americans.\n\nThe data shows that 1.1 million migrants remain in the United States while they wait for a final courtroom decision on whether they can stay or must go home.\n\nThe DHS report said:\n\nEncounters with these different groups tend to lead to different paths through the enforcement system, both in terms of whether and how quickly encounters are resolved and what resolution is reached: Encounters with Mexicans tend to lead to repatriations; encounters with Central Americans tend to remain unresolved; and encounters with nationals from countries other than Mexico or the Northern Triangle tend (on average) to lead to relief. Encounters with single adults tend to quickly lead to repatriations, while encounters with FMUAs [Spouses and children] and non-contiguous UACs [Unaccompanied Alien Children] tend to remain unresolved. Encounters with aliens who do not claim a fear of return to their home countries tend to be repatriated, while those who claim fear are more likely to remain in the United States and some eventually get relief.\n\nAn appendix to the DHS report shows that 315,000 UACs were accompanied from Central America to the border by coyotes from 2013 to 2020. The vast majority were the children of illegal immigrants who had earned enough money in U.S. jobs to hire coyotes to escort their children to U.S. border officers, who then deliver the young migrants to their parents. Only about 15,000 of these younger migrants have been sent home, while roughly 90,000 were allowed to stay — even though many were coming to work as child laborers in jobs that would have been held by Americans.\n\nThe coyotes and migrants improve their odds when they overwhelm the border system, detention facilities, and courtrooms, the DHS report indicated:\n\nThe detention pattern yielding the greatest share of unresolved cases were encounters initially placed in detention but then released prior to a final enforcement outcome. These partially detained encounters resulted in repatriations just 3 percent of the time and relief just 12 percent of the time, with 85 percent still unresolved, including 18 percent with unexecuted removal orders (14 percent in absentia orders).\n\nThat coyotes' strategy was recently aided by three California judges who directed the agencies to reopen the 1997 Flores catch-and-release gateway through the border.\n\nOverall, the low ratio of total losers to partial or complete winners will encourage the next wave of migrants, said Krikorian:\n\nHow could it not, especially once the [Joe] Biden administration comes and let's even more people in? Even if you don't win first prize, the second or third prizes are still pretty good, and with a Democratic administration that is going to be more lax in border enforcement, we're practically inviting people to sneak across the border.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden says his border policies will emphasize the need for family reunification. His policy may help more illegal migrants get into the United States by pleading a need to join their spouses, parents, uncles, or aunts.
Traumatised by its Nazi past, post-war Germany has carefully relegated right-wing populist movements to the fringes of politics, but the anti-migrant AfD may have muscled its way in from the cold.\n\nWith discontent growing in Germany over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal refugee policy, the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday captured seats in the regional parliaments of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nIt garnered as many as close to one in four votes in Saxony-Anhalt while in the other two states, support reached between 12.5 and 15 percent, projections based on partial results showed.\n\nAndreas Roedder, contemporary history professor at Mainz University, told AFP that due to the migrant crisis, we are seeing a normalisation of right-wing populist movements in Germany just like elsewhere in Europe, even if here, it takes on a special form because we can't ignore Germany's past.\n\nThis is not the first time that Germany has experienced such a surge in populism since 1945. Neither is it the first time that such right-wing parties have been able to capture seats in regional parliaments.\n\nIn the 1960s, the NPD, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s the Republikaner — a splinter party from the CSU, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — both managed to send deputies to regional parliaments.\n\nBut each time, they have proved to be no more than passing fads.\n\nThe Christian conservative alliance of the CDU and CSU has thus far been able to occupy the right of the political spectrum, preventing any party from having any lasting claim further right.\n\nThat has until now made German politics unique, compared to Austria, Switzerland or France, where far-right parties have traditionally had a stronger presence in the political arena.\n\nMuch of the reason boils down to war guilt that has made Germans determined to never give the so-called brown shirts a chance to rule the nation again.\n\n– 'Shame for Germany' –\n\nBut AfD has arrived on the political scene at a fortuitous moment.\n\nAfter a record 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015 alone, many Germans are unsettled by what this sudden surge in newcomers mean for their homeland — a fear that AfD has capitalised on.\n\nFirst founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform, it found its first supporters through its claims to defend Germans against free-spending southern EU nations.\n\nSince then it has morphed into a party that has even suggested that police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them from entering the country.\n\nWhile its first successes were concentrated in the former communist east, which has been lagging the west in terms of jobs and opportunities, it is now gaining ground also in prosperous western states.\n\nAfD has become a national German party, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that AfD might even capture seats in the lower house of parliament in elections in 2017 in what would be an unprecedented success for such a movement.\n\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, known for being a straight-talker, simply described AfD as a shame for Germany.\n\nUntil now, right-wing populist or extreme-right parties are considered taboo, considered like aliens in the political sphere, said German political analyst Wolfgang Merkel in a interview with Tagesspiegel daily.\n\nMainstream parties have stridently refused any sort of television debate with AfD members.\n\nBut the analyst believes that the taboo surrounding such right-wing populism could be soon shattered.\n\nIn which case, we would have to live with AfD like France does with the National Front and Switzerland with the SVP (Swiss People's Party), and be confronted daily with xenophobia in political discourse, he said.\n\nSome believe that the chancellor herself is to blame for pushing a middle ground politics that tries to be all things to all people. Although her strategy has led her party to win over some from the centre-left Social Democrats, it has left its right flank exposed.\n\nWith the 'social democratisation' and therefore a shift left of the CDU under the chancellor's mandate, it's more difficult for the Christian Democrats to cover all bases on the right, said Bernhard Wessels, political analyst at Berlin's Humboldt University.\n\nDie Welt daily went as far as to say that AfD is Merkel's child because the CDU has ditched its identity.
In a Wednesday op-ed, the Los Angeles Times called for the initiation of wide scale de-Trumpification and the shunning of exiting Trump administration officials who are described as arsonists fleeing a wreckage they've made.\n\nThe essay, penned by University of California-Irvine law professor and former U.N. Special Rapporteur on free speech David Kaye, questions how Trump administration officials and appointees, including the shameless liars, the sycophants and the cynical enablers in Congress who knowingly sacrificed their reputations to support this president are to be held accountable after the end of President Trump's term later this month.\n\nThough exiting political appointees have traditionally landed at prestigious institutions, with some becoming experts in the media, keynote conference speakers, memoirists with book deals, and others running for office or working for the public interest, these should not necessarily be available to former officials of the Trump administration, according to Kaye.\n\nNot so fast, the essay declares. Elite institutions unthinkingly opening their doors to this crew will facilitate exactly what we must avoid: normalizing the Trump years and evading a reckoning for Trumpism.\n\nKaye then accuses departing Trump administration officials as a group, without providing evidence, of having participated in undermining the democratic process, perpetuated lies from podiums, attacked the press, corrupted our foreign policy and intelligence agencies, damaged government departments devoted to the environment and education and much more.\n\nBy doing all this, Trump officials should forfeit the normally automatic benefits that come from a stint in government, he adds.\n\nCommending only a few who maintained their independence and spoke truth to power inside and out of government, the rest of the Trump administration officials are to be met with skepticism about the value [they] bring to any mainstream institution.\n\nLaw firms, for example, should scrutinize Trump lawyers carefully as they return to private practice, and corporate boards should just say no.\n\nIn addition, the essay calls for journalists and their editors to think hard about how they integrate the voices of Trump officials in their stories and to indicate their Trump affiliation and role clearly when being quoted.\n\nLastly, Kaye calls for a meaningful and high-profile process of public accounting for Trump administration actions that overstepped the law.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph, Kaye seeks to ensure the reader that his propositions are not primitive, though they may appear to be so.\n\nShunning may sound primitive, but it is not, he writes. It can be a way to reinforce democratic values.\n\nThe essay is part of a host of calls on the left to shun conservative voices and at a time of unprecedented purges of such voices on various social media platforms.\n\nLast Thursday, a Forbes Magazine op-ed warned companies about hiring fabulists from the Trump administration.\n\nLet it be known to the business world: Hire any of Trump's fellow fabulists above, and Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie, Forbes Magazine's chief content officer, Randall Lane, wrote.\n\nAlso last week, the anti-Trump Lincoln Project announced that it was building a database of Trump officials and staffers with the intention of holding them professionally accountable for supporting the president.\n\nAt @ProjectLincoln we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now. No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved https://t.co/DkpxpaWaWB — stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) January 9, 2021\n\nLast month, a Washington Post essay encouraged the media to shun Republicans who questioned the election results.\n\nThe essay itself admitted promoting a radical approach yet stood by it as the only way to safely proceed with live interviews with Republicans who may be carrying a dangerous conspiracy theory that spreads on air.\n\nAlso last month, the Washington Post published an essay comparing denying election results to denying the Holocaust and using that as a pretext to silence opposing voices.\n\nWe would not allow a Holocaust denier to speak on evening news programs or have free rein on social media, the essay's authors write unequivocally. Old and new media alike should no longer give a platform to these dissimulations, starting with Trump's.\n\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech Monday at the Heritage Foundation marked a pivotal moment in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nPompeo made several important arguments in the course of his half hour address, in which he set out President Donald Trump's policy regarding Iran in the wake of his May 8 announcement that he is abandoning Barack Obama's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe key line in his speech was, inarguably, As President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing and able to negotiate a new deal [with Iran]. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.\n\nThe basic insight that there is no intrinsic value to any agreement – or foreign policy initiative of any sort – that does not advance the interests of the United States or protect the American people is striking, because it has been absent from American foreign policy in relation to rogue regimes and entities for better part of the last generation.\n\nIn 1994, when then president Bill Clinton sought to contend with North Korea's illicit nuclear program, the first fantasist president, Jimmy Carter, turned up in Pyongyang to see if there was a deal to be had.\n\nAs Claudia Rosett has noted, North Korea was on the ropes back then. Its patron, the Soviet Union, had collapsed three years earlier, and its cash flow had dried up. China was still too poor to pick up the slack, as it had just undergone its first succession. Famine was killing North Koreans by the tens of thousands.\n\nAnd it had just been caught, red handed, violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which it was a signatory, and developing plutonium-based nuclear weapons at its Yangbyon nuclear reactor.\n\nIf Clinton had confronted the North Koreans for their duplicity and malign behavior towards the region and towards their own subjects, he stood a decent chance of bringing an end to the regime.\n\nInstead, following Carter's odd intervention, Clinton decided to hand the Stalinist hermit gulag state a new lease on life. He sent Wendy Sherman, his special advisor for North Korea, to negotiate what became known as the Agreed Framework.\n\nIn exchange for padlocking — but preserving — their plutonium reactor at Yangbyon, the North Koreans received internationally financed light water reactors and some $4.5 billion in fuel and food aid. The regime was saved, empowered and legitimized.\n\nAnd North Korea's regime wasted no time in cheating on the nuclear deal — developing intercontinental ballistic missiles; testing them; proliferating their missile and nuclear technologies and know-how to Iran and Syria; and building a nuclear arsenal that now threatens the U.S. and its allies.\n\nBut Clinton was happy. He had a deal. He was a statesman. And no matter how much proof surfaced of North Korea's continued nuclear activity, he and his advisors — and, later, his successors George W. Bush and Obama — were unwilling to do a thing about it. The notion that it was possible to cut a deal with North Korea was more important than the substance of the deal. The fact that the regime's policies endangered the American people – not to mention all U.S. allies in Asia and beyond — was beside the point.\n\nThe point was the deal.\n\nThe same was the case with the Palestinians. As Clinton, Bush and Obama all saw it, the only salient question regarding the Palestinians was whether or not Israel was willing to cut a deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They considered PLO sponsorship and incitement of terror a mere distraction. The PLO's partnership with Hamas was said to be a passing phase. PLO corruption and embezzlement of billions of dollars in U.S. and international aid dollars was just an irritant.\n\nThe only thing three successive administrations concerned themselves with regarding the Palestinians generally, and the PLO specifically, was whether or not they would say from time to time that they were willing to cut a deal – any deal – with Israel.\n\nAs far as all three administrations were concerned, the possibility of mediating a deal — the deal — between Israel and the PLO was the only U.S. Middle East policy that mattered. Everything else was secondary. The situation reached a level of absurdity where every issue was viewed as contingent on Israel agreeing to make a deal with the Palestinians.\n\nFor instance, in 2006, then-President Bush appointed former secretary of state James Baker and former congressman Lee Hamilton to present him with a strategy for dealing with the insurgency in Iraq. The two men said that the U.S. could safely withdraw its forces from Iraq if it did so while forcing Israel to cut a deal with the PLO.\n\nWhy Iran or Syria or their terror proxies in al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and other militias would stand down if Israel gave Jerusalem to PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas was never explained.\n\nIt was never explained because as everyone who was anyone in Washington agreed, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East wasn't about securing the American people per se. It was about cutting a deal.\n\nThis, then, brings us to the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), better known as the Iran nuclear deal, which Wendy Sherman also negotiated. As she did in 1994 with the North Koreans, Sherman negotiated a deal based on the notion that it didn't matter what the deal said, but rather only that it was concluded.\n\nU.S. foreign policy officials from the Clinton administration on down repeatedly argued that merely signing a deal would create a positive dynamic that would encourage rogue regimes – whether in Pyongyang or Ramallah or Tehran – to change their behavior and assessment of Washington and its allies.\n\nThe fact that this assumption has never been borne out by events — and indeed, has been repeatedly contradicted and proven wrong by events — never made an impression on the foreign policy experts who clung to the notion that process is more important than substance.\n\nIn this context, the Trump Doctrine is brilliant in its simplicity and straightforwardness.\n\nThe Trump Doctrine involves a simple concept: U.S. foreign policy must be grounded in reality rather than fantasy, and its aim is to achieve the only goal that matters: securing and enhancing the security of the American people.\n\nIt is a testament to President Trump's iconoclasm and common sense that he has embraced reality after so many years of fantasy presidencies.\n\nBut his decision to prefer reality over theory is also borne of necessity. The bill has come due on his predecessors' unhinged deals.\n\nAs President Trump has noted repeatedly, the U.S. reached the end of the road with North Korea. After Pyongyang tested intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland of the U.S. last summer, it was clear there was nowhere to kick the can anymore.\n\nWith Iran using the status and wealth it received from Obama's nuclear deal to realize its imperialist aspirations in the Middle East, while actively engaging in armed attacks against Israel and Saudi Arabia, maintaining faith with the nuclear deal that enabled Iran to bring the region to the brink of a massive war was no longer an option.\n\nAs for the PLO and Israel, the jig finally is up on that fairytale as well. With its 83-year-old, corrupt, virulently antisemitic, anti-American, terror-supporting leader Mahmoud Abbas on the verge of death, the Palestinian Authority is about to decompose altogether or transform into something else. And whatever may happen there, it is now inarguable that the terror group is a bit player, not a power broker.\n\nNo regional issue of concern to the U.S. will be ameliorated by appeasing the PLO.\n\nAs for Israel, due to the wreckage of weakened Arab allies on the one hand, and empowered enemies left by Trump's predecessors on the other, the Trump administration cannot follow the old practice of treating Israel like a problem. The now-undeniable fact is that when Israel strikes Iranian installations in Syria and Iran's proxies in Gaza, it is stabilizing the region, not destabilizing the region.\n\nAnother undeniable fact is that Israel is America's most powerful and trustworthy ally in the Middle East. To the extent a deal between the PLO and Israel weakens Israel – and every deal that has been presented over the past 25 years, like the phony peace process itself, has weakened Israel – U.S. interests are harmed.\n\nMany commentators have interpreted Pompeo's list of twelve specific demands from Iran as an opening bid for future negotiations with Tehran.\n\nBut his own statements indicate that this is not the case. Pompeo rightly explained that all of his demands — from Iran ending and dismantling its nuclear program and ballistic missiles program, to ending its sponsorship of terror groups; from withdrawing its forces from Syria, to releasing all U.S. and foreign hostages it holds — are basic demands.\n\nThere are so many demands, Pompeo explained, because at a fundamental level, Iran is breaching the most basic norms of international behavior. Every single activity he demanded that Iran halt is an activity that undermines not only regional security, but also U.S. national security. As such, compelling Iranian compliance with the Trump administration's demands is vital to the security of the American people.\n\nThe media echo chamber has made much of the fact that the North Korean regime is now making noises to the effect that it is unwilling to make a deal with the Trump administration. Insults against National Security Advisor John Bolton in the North Korean media are pointed to as proof that Trump's America First foreign policy is undermining efforts to secure a deal with North Korea.\n\nThese commentaries miss the point. As Pompeo and Trump himself have explained, American foreign policy is no longer driven by a slavish devotion to Wendy Sherman-esque deals with enemies of America.\n\nAmerican foreign policy is now about making Americans safe in the real world.\n\nAnd, thanks to the slavish devotion of the previous three administrations to agreements-at-all-cost, achieving the goal of protecting Americans has become urgent, dire, and no job for showboaters who want to be loved by Europe and MSNBC.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

Leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) Sebastian Kurz has announced a coalition agreement with the Green Party that will see several green policies but no changes to migration policy.\n\nMr Kurz, along with Green Party leader Werner Kogler presented their new government programme at a joint press conference on Thursday, with Kurz claiming the new government would be the best of both worlds and that its priorities would be tax reform and fighting illegal immigration, Kronen Zeitung reports.\n\nThe ÖVP leader added that both parties had also agreed to ban the Islamic headscarf for children under the age of 14 and would be expanding programmes to teach new migrants the German language and put more emphasis on getting asylum seekers into the labour force.\n\nKurz has been critical of migration policies within the European Union since forming the previous government with the populist Freedom Party.\n\nAustria's Sebastian Kurz Warns of New Migrant Wave 'Brewing' https://t.co/pSxWAzyfHP — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019\n\nIn 2018, he went as far as confronting German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the issue, disagreeing on her proposal to link EU funds to migration quotas.\n\nGreen leader Kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for Austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of Co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. He also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.\n\nThe two-party leaders then met with leftist Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, a former member of the Green Party, with Kogler telling the Austrian press that the entire programme for the new coalition was still being worked on.\n\nThe Greens are expected to occupy four ministerial posts including the Environmental Ministry and the Justice Ministry, with the party demanding at least half of the ministers be female.\n\nThe successful government deal comes after Kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the Austrian national election in September of last year.
Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation that removing Trump from office with impeachment is clearly is not going to happen.\n\nDiscussing the riots, anchor Margaret Brennan said, Are Republican leaders going to hold him accountable in any way for it?\n\nBlunt said, I think the country is is the right to hold presidents accountable. The president should be very careful over the next 10 days is that his behavior is what you would expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. My personal view is that the president touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.\n\nHe continued, I did, the day Senator Hawley announced he would be contesting those electoral votes, announced that I would not be. When Senator Cruz said he had a plan to put back in place a commission like the one formed in 1877, I said that wouldn't happen. I wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen just like the impeachment of the president to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he is in office.\n\nHe added, As Nancy Pelosi just said and Jim Clyburn said earlier today, this is more about a long-term punishment of the president than trying to remove him from office.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Six GOP Senators briefed Jared Kushner and President Donald Trump's top congressional aide about a plan to swap two amnesties in exchange for border-wall funding.\n\nThe briefing shows the GOP leaders' contempt for Trump's immigration-reform campaign promise, said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at NumbersUSA. There is no talk in this about asylum reform, TVPRA, detention spaces or sanctuary cities, or any of the enforcement needs — it is about amnesty and cheap labor, and that is exactly what Candidate Tump campaigned against.\n\nThe proposed amnesties-for-wall swap appeared Wednesday as Trump pressured Democrats to reciprocate his compromises on the day after his successful prime-time address to the nation. On Thursday, Trump will visit the border to call for wall funding.\n\nThe Senators' draft offer to the Democrats, however, also includes incentives sought by GOP-aligned business groups, such as an expansion of the H-2B blue collar visa-worker program.\n\nFew Democrats support the H-2B visa program but its inclusion could encourage GOP legislators to ignore protests from the GOP's pro-American base. Several GOP Senators in the group also support a DACA amnesty because it would add more imported workers and consumers to their local markets.\n\nCNN reported:\n\nGOP senators privately gathered in Sen. Lindsey Graham's office Wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. The long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include $5.7 billion for Trump's border wall along with several provisions that could entice Democrats. Those items include changes to help those who are a part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as well as immigrants from El Salvador and other countries impacted by the Temporary Protected Status program – along with modifications to H-2B visas.\n\nThe DACA work-permit program for roughly 800,000 younger illegals was created by former President Barack Obama in 2012 but is likely to be declared unlawful this year by the Supreme Court. Trump is rolling back the TPS program, which grants temporary sanctuary and work permits to more than 300,000 visitors from countries hit by disasters. The TPS grants were repeatedly extended by former Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, even after the countries recovered from their disasters.\n\nCNN continued:\n\nGOP senators pitched the idea to senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got Trump his border wall money and could pass the Senate, the White House would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. He did not say Trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nHowever, other media outlets did not corroborate CNN's claim that Kushner said Trump would endorse amnesties and cheap-labor wage-cuts in exchange for a wall.\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\nGraham said that under a potential deal the president gets his security funding and can add some things to the mix that would draw some bipartisan support.\n\n… Graham summarized the framework as the wall plus something else that he hopes would garner some Democratic support.\n\nThe six GOP Senators included Graham, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, Tennessee's Lamar Alexander, Ohio's Rob Portman, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, and Maine's Susan Collins.\n\nKushner was accompanied by Shahira Knight, the former banker who now runs Trump's outreach to the Hill. In August, Knight declined to oppose a series of unpopular pro-migration and cheap-labor amendments added to to the draft 2019 homeland security budget by Rep. Kevin Yoder. Those giveaway measures were paired with a $5 billion budget for the wall but were blocked when Yoder lost his seat in November.\n\nKushner meets with moderate GOP senators amid shutdown https://t.co/qTqWjF8S9K pic.twitter.com/8f0812XE9P — The Hill (@thehill) January 10, 2019\n\nMedia outlets reported the GOP group consists of moderates. But the group of GOP Senators included the main backers of a double-amnesty bill that won nearly unanimous Democratic support for a series of votes in February.\n\nIf that double-amnesty bill — largely drafted by Collins and Graham — had passed, it would have minimized the marketplace pressures which are now raising Americans' wages at more than 3 percent a year, and would also have raised profits for investors and CEOs.\n\nWatch Sen.

That double-amnesty bill was narrowly blocked amid strenuous, last-minute opposition from the White House.\n\nIn the days before that vote, Graham also said that employers in his district want to bring in more blue-collar workers. He told reporters on January 21:\n\nWe need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card.

That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) responded on Sunday's broadcast of CBS's Face the Nation to remarks by Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon, who addressed Sanders calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a reactionary racist.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the UN says of you that you're not welcome in that country and Anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean, they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid, I spent time in Israel. I am not in- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel, but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You've got 70 percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even handed policy.\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel. I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Netflix faced criticism on Wednesday for pulling an episode in Saudi Arabia of comedian Hasan Minhaj's Patriot Act that criticized the kingdom's powerful crown prince.\n\nThe American comedian used his second episode, released on Oct. 28, to lambaste Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of writer Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi-led coalition at war in Yemen.\n\nMinhaj said the crown prince was being hailed as the reformer the Arab world needed until Khashoggi's killing.\n\nBut the revelations about Khashoggi's killing have shattered that image and it blows my mind that it took the killing of a Washington Post journalist for everyone to go: 'Oh I guess he's not really a reformer,' he added. Khashoggi wrote critically of the crown prince in columns for the newspaper.\n\nKhashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. The U.S. Senate has said it believes the crown prince is responsible for the grisly killing, despite insistence by the kingdom that he had no knowledge of the operation.\n\nIn the roughly 18-minute monologue, Minhaj also mentions the ruling Al Saud family and its vast wealth, saying: Saudi Arabia is crazy. One giant family controls everything.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition's airstrikes in Yemen have also come under intense scrutiny since Khashoggi's killing. The war, which began in March 2015, has killed thousands of civilians and pushed millions to the brink of famine.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported that Netflix yanked the episode from streaming in Saudi Arabia last week after the government's Communications and Information Technology Commission informed the internet streaming service that its content violated cyber-crime laws in the kingdom. The FT says the episode can still be seen on YouTube in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNetflix told the FT it strongly supports artistic freedom worldwide and only removed the episode after it received a legal request and to comply with local law.\n\nOfficials at the Communications and Information Technology Commission could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said Saudi Arabia's censorship of Netflix is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression.\n\nBy bowing to the Saudi Arabian authorities' demands, Netflix is in danger of facilitating the kingdom's zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people's right to freely access information, said Samah Hadid at Amnesty International.\n\nNetflix did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi cyber-crime law states that production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine, according to rights group Amnesty International.\n\nSaudi prosecutors have used the broadly worded law to imprison rights activists, poets and others who've expressed views deemed critical of the government or its policies on social media.\n\nSince Prince Mohammed was named heir to the throne in mid-2017, dozens of writers, activists and moderate clerics have been jailed.\n\nAmong those detained since May of last year are women's rights activists who had long pushed for more freedoms, including the right to drive before it became legal in June. Several people with knowledge of their arrest have told The Associated Press that some of the women detained have been subjected to caning, electrocution and others were also sexually assaulted.
A poll of United States service members and veterans finds that only 39 percent approve of transgender individuals serving in the military.\n\nWhen the sex of the respondent is a factor, the poll – which surveyed the views of 1,031 service members and veterans – shows that 37 percent of male members approve of transgender troops, while 62 percent of females approve.\n\nOnly 32 percent of the Greatest Generation (World War II) approve of transgender troops, while 39 percent of Baby Boomers, 42 percent of Generation X, and 55 percent of Millennials approve.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued the decades-long policy that bans transgender individuals from military service, but legal challenges to it continue. On Friday, however, federal appellate judges in Washington, D.C. vacated one injunction that had blocked the policy, though it continues to be blocked by other courts. The Supreme Court is considering whether it will review the policy.\n\nIn response to a statement about having experienced gender or gender identity discrimination in the military, only 11 percent of survey respondents answered yes.\n\nWith sex as a factor, only six percent of male service members say they have experienced gender discrimination, while 68 percent of female members say the same.\n\nSimilarly, 11 percent of participants say they have personally experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment in the military.\n\nOf the males, only six percent say they have been sexually assaulted or harassed, while 66 percent of females claim the same.\n\nWhen asked if they had witnessed another member of the service being sexually harassed or assaulted during their military service, 19 percent of those surveyed said yes.\n\nOf the male participants, 17 percent said they had witnessed sexual assault or harassment, while 42 percent of the females said the same.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Smithsonian in conjunction with both Stars and Stripes– a publication of the Defense Department – and the Schar School at George Mason University.\n\nOverall, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percent.
The coronavirus outbreak continues to grow. On Wednesday, 201 U.S. citizens who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, arrived in the United States and were transported to the March Air Reserve Base in California, where they are being informally quarantined and monitored for a three-day period.\n\nBut there's a crucial group of people who are not being quarantined and monitored—the thousands of Chinese nationals sneaking into the United States from Mexico.\n\nIn December, eleven Chinese migrants were caught illegally crossing the border in a rental truck carrying furniture from Tijuana to San Diego. A month earlier, six Chinese migrants had been caught sneaking into the country at the same port of entry using a moving truck. These cases were not isolated instances. They are part of a problem that has been growing for the past two years.\n\nAnd it's not a problem that's limited to the border regions of California. Illegal entries by Chinese nationals are on the rise all across the Mexican border.\n\nFor example, look at the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector, which is the section of border in Texas abutting the Gulf of Mexico. In FY 2019, the number of Chinese migrants caught at the southern border in the RGV Sector increased 85%, from approximately 700 to over 1,300.\n\nAlthough figures for the entire border haven't been made public, it is likely that the number of Chinese nationals apprehended at the Mexican border is well over 4,000. And, for every illegal alien who is caught at the border, there are at least three who make it in without getting caught.\n\nThat means that, estimating conservatively, more than 12,000 Chinese nationals entered the country illegally across the southern border in FY 2019. And none of them were screened for infectious diseases. This year a similar number are sneaking into the United States—coming from the country that is the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAt times like this, it is imperative that the process of immigration be orderly and controlled. A secure border is essential in our defense against not only crime and terrorism, but also against pandemics.\n\nIf Congress had given the President all of the money for border wall construction that he needed back in 2017, the United States would be in a much better position to address this crisis. The 450 miles of wall that are now in the stages of planning and early construction would already be completed. And it would be much more difficult to enter the United States illegally.\n\nAnd that means greater security during times of pandemic. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States will undoubtedly grow from the six known cases—in California, Arizona, Washington State, and Illinois. But worthy of note is the case in Reynosa, Mexico, right next to the U.S. border. The international border next to Reynosa is wide open. And so is our vulnerability to the coronavirus being carried across it.\n\nKris W. Kobach served as the Secretary of State of Kansas during 2011-2019.

Border Patrol agents in the Laredo Sector discovered 36 illegal immigrants packed into a tiny stash house while assisting officers from the Laredo Police Department on Monday.\n\nSpecial Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations division contacted the Laredo Station about suspicious activity in a house located near Slaughter Park. The park is a known location for smuggling humans and drugs across the border. The agents went to check out the house with the help of the local police department, according to Laredo Border Patrol officials.\n\nAfter making entry into the house, the agents found 36 illegal immigrants stashed inside. The migrants came to the U.S. from Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras, officials stated.\n\nThe partnerships in Laredo between the United States Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Laredo Police Department continue to show results in disrupting criminal organizations from operating in South Texas. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prosecute those responsible and prevent individuals from being subjected to deplorable conditions, Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said in a written statement.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations is leading the investigation into the possible human trafficking charges that could be filed.\n\nThe migrants are now subject to prosecution in criminal court for illegally entering the U.S. according to a zero tolerance policy put in place by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday.\n\nThe attorney general said his department will refer anyone who enters the United States illegally for prosecution, Breitbart News reported.\n\nAnd the Department of Justice will take up as many of those cases as humanly possible until we get to 100 percent, Sessions said as part of a speech at a law enforcement conference in Arizona.
A handful of Republican and Democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Democrats such as Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Debbie Dingell (D-MI) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News, Meadows said he has had multiple conversations with Graham about a DACA amnesty-for-wall funding deal:\n\nCompromise and finding common ground are not void from the conversations that he and I have had, as well as some of the conversations I've had with some of my Democratic colleagues, Meadows said. [Emphasis added] Though the Freedom Caucus has previously opposed extending protections from deportation for the children of undocumented immigrants, Meadows suggested he would be open to a deal to preserve such concessions in exchange for wall funding. [Emphasis added]\n\nGraham has touted an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens for months as part of a deal on funding at least a portion of Trump's proposed wall.\n\nCoincidentally, the DACA amnesty deal is supported by the billionaire donor class that delivers campaign funds every election cycle to Republicans and Democrats who support the country's mass illegal and legal immigration policy of importing about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers every year to compete against America's working and middle class.\n\nAs Breitbart News most recently reported, the billionaire Koch brothers and their network of organizations have made passing an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens their goal for the new year.\n\nSimilarly, billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's cheap labor lobbying group FWD.us is asking Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump administration to reach a deal whereby DACA illegal aliens are allowed to permanently remain in the U.S.\n\nThe organization, founded and funded by Silicon Valley's tech plutocrats, has been demanding an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens since at least 2017.\n\nSo here is what ⁦@FWDus⁩ would like to see happen with the incoming Congress, this harmful shutdown and urgently needed immigration policy changes… pic.twitter.com/zFfGepPVBg — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) January 3, 2019\n\nOn Fox News, operated by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a deal wherby DACA illegal aliens are given amnesty in exchange for some border wall funding has been floated repeatedly. Last week, a Fox News host touted such a plan with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nBut let me ask this, we're talking about money, $5 billion $1.5 billion, $2.7 billion, the host said. Why aren't there other things on the table? DACA for example, is that being negotiated?\n\nMulvaney said that while the money for a border wall is being negotiated, other changes to the country's immigration system are being discussed as well, though he did not specifically cite the DACA program as one of those changes.\n\nAny form of amnesty coupled with funds to build a wall along the southern border would render the barrier almost useless in stopping illegal immigration, Breitbart News has noted.\n\nWhile a border wall would take years to build, amnesty for illegal aliens would be nearly immediate, delivering benefits to illegal aliens and foreign nationals first, while Americans only see the hope of a border wall down the road.\n\nIn terms of legal immigration, a DACA amnesty would implement a never-ending flow of foreign relatives to the DACA illegal aliens who can be readily sponsored for green cards through the process known as chain migration — a flow of potentially more than 8.5 million legal immigrants.\n\nMeanwhile, a DACA amnesty would drag increasing U.S. wages down for the country's working and middle class, delivering benefits to the business lobby while squashing the intended goals of the Trump administration ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The plan is also likely to hit the black American community the hardest, as they are forced to compete for blue collar jobs against a growing illegal and legal immigrant population from Central America.
Thursday on Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor, host Bill O'Reilly offered his takeaways from the terrorist attacks in Brussels earlier this week.\n\nO'Reilly argued much of this could have been prevented if not for European governments' policy decisions on immigration and on policing.\n\nSo to repeat, [Obama] is not going to use American resources to defeat ISIS, O'Reilly said. Second thing we've learned: Europe is in chaos. As you know, millions of mostly Islamic refugees are pouring into Western Europe. Nobody knows who they are, nobody knows what they're doing. In Belgium where the bombers struck this week intelligence agents cannot tap telephones, they cannot look into computers, and police are restrained from raiding private homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. And Belgium wonders why it is a terror target? The incredible laxity on immigration and the ultra-liberal policing have made Europe the easiest target in the world for ISIS. And believe me if the far left had its way here, we'd be just like Belgium.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
Many Americans may not know her name, but Gary Kaltbaum appeared on Breitbart News Thursday to explain why Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen is the most important woman in our lives.\n\nJanet Yellen is able to move the purse strings around in ways unimaginable, said Kaltbaum. Keep in mind, this started with Ben Bernanke, who decided to go with this grand experiment of zero percent interest rates, and the printing of trillions of dollars, which led to Janet Yellen.\n\nKaltbaum charged Bernanke's money-manipulation policies with causing the housing market bubble and crash, leading in turn to the desperate bank bailouts of 2008. That meant big money for big bankers… and the screwing of the average American.\n\nThat's because average Americans find it difficult to earn money through savings in a zero-interest environment.\n\nAs Breitbart News host Stephen K. Bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. The punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. Not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.\n\nThe riskless income investor was taken away and was given to the banks, said Kaltbaum. It was gifted to the banks, and that's why the banks have done better over the last few years.\n\nFew politicians see political gain in railing against this state of affairs, including the socialists from the ostensible Party of the Little Guy. The Democratic Party is not for the middle class and poor, said Kaltbaum. They're for the middle class and poor's votes. Go look at all their policies. Just recently, Barack Obama is proposing a ten percent tax on oil companies, where everybody knows it's gonna be flushed down into the consumer. Who gets hit the worst? The poor and the middle class.\n\nBut nobody says anything, he sighed. This is about currying votes… keep marketing to these people that you're the end-all and be-all. You're going to do this, that, and the other thing for them. But they end up doing nothing for nobody, except themselves, and their own power base.\n\nKaltbaum saw little hope of a popular revolt against these exploitative policies until the masses have been properly educated in economics – an education they will never receive from a mass media with the Democrat Party's political interests at heart, and a natural tendency to revere big, splashy, centrally-planned solutions to the nation's problems.\n\nIn an interconnected global economy, the world's problems become America's problems, too. While the coming financial implosion of China is seen as both a financial and national-security threat by almost every U.S. government agency, Kaltbaum said the even worse news is that America's fiscal situation is more troubling than China's.\n\nWe are the country that's $20 trillion in debt, he warned. We are the country that has papered over this with $5 trillion in printed money, and zero percent interest rates. We are the country where taxes, and mandates, and regulations are going up, and government is taking over our life.\n\nIt's a combination of China, and Europe, and its socialist states and their massive debt, and our country – which has gone from a great, market-based, free market economy into something that is controlled by these big, power-hungry, power-centric maniacs that present a looming crisis for the American taxpayer… which, of course, will also be forced to clean up the wreckage afterward, and pick up the tab for the failures of their political elites.\n\nBannon noted that Janet Yellen wasn't prepared to say that even a lunatic policy like Japan's negative interest rates would be beyond her authority. I've got news for you – even if it's illegal, they'll make it legal anyway, Kaltbaum agreed, citing President Obama's abuse of executive power as precedent.\n\nAnything is possible at this point in time, he concluded. As the markets go lower, we're going to see more acts of desperation, and they're going to try to come up with things that, in our lifetimes, we would never even dream would occur. And I suspect negative interest rates will probably be a part of it.\n\nListen:
Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, announced Friday he will not seek another term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nJUST IN: GOP Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas announces he won't seek reelection in 2020. Never, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become the longest-serving member of Congress in our state's history pic.twitter.com/soZ1BPpLbD — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) January 4, 2019\n\nSpeaking before reporters in Manhattan, Kansas, Roberts said: I am announcing I will serve the remainder of this term as your senator, fighting for Kansas in these troubled times. However, I will not be a candidate in 2020 for a fifth Senate term.\n\nNever, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become the longest-serving member of Congress in our state's history, he added.\n\nRoberts, 82, maneuvered the 2018 farm bill through Congress with support from both parties — a move ultimately embraced by President Donald Trump as a rare bipartisan success. However, some Republican critics argue Roberts' work across the aisle resulted in a deeply flawed and costly farm bill that represents a betrayal of conservative values. It's a slap in the face to Ronald Reagan, said Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. It's a victory for a massive welfare state without work requirements and an out-of-control budget.\n\nNo one had yet announced a primary challenge against Roberts, but conservative activists viewed him as vulnerable from the right. He narrowly survived a primary against tea party candidate Milton Wolf in 2014. Republicans including outgoing Gov. Jeff Colyer (R) and Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) are eyeing a race in anticipation that Roberts might not run.\n\nIn a December opinion-editorial, The Kansas City Star's editorial board called on Roberts to retire and step aside to allow other qualified candidates to seek the office.\n\n[T]he 21st century will demand fresher ideas — not just on farm policy, but on trade, immigration, taxation, spending, defense and other national challenges. Roberts isn't the senator who will provide those new ideas, the bluntly stated op-ed read. This isn't a matter of the senator's age, although Roberts will be 84 years old in 2020. It's much more about Roberts' four decades of service in the House and Senate, a long tenure that makes it difficult for him to see things in a different way.\n\nRoberts has served as the senior senator from Kansas since 1997 and was elected in his home state's First Congressional District to the House of Representatives in 1980.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) announced last month that he will not run for re-election in 2020.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
The Director of National Intelligence called Transnational Organized Crime a growing threat to the security and health of U.S. citizens. The director said these groups, including Mexican drug cartels and MS-13 cliques, contribute to increased social violence and the erosion of governmental authority in many countries.\n\nMexican criminal groups will continue to supply much of the heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana that cross the US-Mexico border, while China-based suppliers ship fentanyls and fentanyl precursors to Mexico-, Canada-, and U.S. based distributors or sell directly to consumers via the Internet, Daniel R. Coats, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Worldwide Threat Assessment report released on Tuesday (attached below).\n\nIn 2016, the report states that drug overdoses accounted for more deaths than suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and all forms of homicide. The number of drug overdoses skyrocketed during the past two years–doubling in 2016 because of the national opioid epidemic.\n\nTransnational organized criminal groups probably will generate more revenue from illicit activity in the coming year, which the UN last estimated at $1.6-$2.2 trillion for 2014, the DNI continued.\n\nIn addition to drug smuggling, the director also listed the continuing human trafficking enterprises carried out around the world by transnational criminal organizations. The DNI estimates that about 25 million people are victimized by human traffickers.\n\nThe DNI listed epidemic criminal activity as one of the key political issues for 2016.\n\nPresidential elections, including those in Mexico and Colombia, will occur at a time when support for political parties and governing institutions is at record lows and could bolster the appeal of outsider candidates, the report states.\n\nRegarding Mexico specifically, the Director Coats wrote:\n\nMexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for July 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. The Mexican Government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. Mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. President Enrique Pena Nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the September 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential US policy shifts ahead of the elections. In recent years, Mexican US-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.\n\nBreitbart Texas has reported extensively on the unstable political climate created by the Mexican drug cartels through its Cartel Chronicles series. The series utilizes citizen journalists who are willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\n\nThe reports from Mexico record the ultra-violent activities of the drug cartels — particularly in the civil war-torn region of Tamaulipas, just south of the Texas border.\n\nCartel Chronicles reported on Tuesday about the kidnapping and murder of a federal narcotics agent near Cancun.\n\nThe anonymous writer reported:\n\nMexican federal law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that late last week, 27-year-old Hugo Enrique Rafael Peña went missing and was discovered hours later–shot multiple times, blindfolded with tape, and hands tied. According to police file 65/2018, authorities found 11 9mm bullet casings at the scene.\n\nBreitbart Texas also reports on U.S. prosecutors' efforts to extradite former Mexican governors for their alleged roles in narcotics trafficking and public corruption.\n\nBreitbart Texas editor-in-chief and managing director, Brandon Darby, and investigative journalist Ildefonso Ortiz reported:\n\nFormer Tamaulipas Governor Eugenio Hernandez Flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the Southern District of Texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. The case against Hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. … Hernandez and his predecessor, Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by U.S. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into Texas. As Breitbart Texas reported, Yarrington is currently in an Italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the U.S. related to Los Zetas, the Gulf, and the Beltran Leyva Cartels.\n\nDirector Coats also addressed the massive migration of people from Central American and attributed this crisis to gang-related violence, particularly in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.\n\nThe report concludes:\n\nInsecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting Central Americans to flee.\n\nThe director prepared the Worldwide Threat Assessment report for 2018 in preparation for testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

A German government ministry has begun an aggressive advertising campaign urging citizens to overcome their dark side and embrace open door mass migration and multiculturalism.\n\nGermany, stay strong! With humanity towards your dark side and Against Hate & baiting – no ifs or buts read the propaganda billboards.\n\nThe text is written over a German flag dripping with black paint. Organisers say they hope to retrieve the flag from right wing and nationalist groups such as the PEGIDA and the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD), represented on the poster by the encroaching black paint.\n\n'Germany, stay strong!' Is a call to civil society, to oppose right-wing tendencies and incitement. An appeal to a welcoming culture for people in need – and for a cosmopolitan Germany, writes the left wing 'Show Your Face! For a cosmopolitan Germany' group on its website.\n\nSix hundred such giant billboard adverts are expected to go up, and 20,000 stickers and 45,000 postcards will be distributed in the campaign, which is backed by Germany's Ministry for Families, Seniors, Women and Youth.\n\nPEGIDA and Co. abuse the flag of the Federal Republic, proclaimed Uwe-Karsten Heye, the chairman of the group at the campaign launch. Indeed the flag and Constitution stand for an open society, the right to asylum and for inviolable human dignity, he claimed.\n\nMerkel Removes the German Flag Angela Merkel's disdain for Germany, summed up in 9 seconds. Posted by Raheem Kassam on Saturday, January 30, 2016\n\nI think it is necessary to give people courage to stand against right-wing extremism and xenophobia, Mr. Heye added, talking to Der Tagesspeigel.\n\nThe organisation's manager, Sophia Oppermann, said that they also wished to encourage left wing and humanitarian groups to use and display the national flag more often.\n\nWe're tired with the right constantly waving the German flag, and all the others have no chance, she said. We are also proud of this country and we stand for the values ​​that have this flag and this country.\n\nSpecifically, the group wants the German public to embrace the 1.5 million migrants who arrived in Germany in 2015, and to keep welcoming them this year as Chancellor Merkel's open door policy continues unabated.\n\nWe must continue to act with humanity and we must insist that we are dealing with individuals, individuals, have to do, Ms. Oppermann said.\n\nShe argued that the majority of migrants were refugees seeking protection, but admitted there are huge problems associated with the mass influx from the Middle East.\n\nYou have to develop ideas on how you can do that, she said. Adding: People will, together we hope, strengthen the great majority of society.
The official Twitter account for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations airspace body, spent much of Monday and Tuesday blocking social media users who noted that its exclusion of Taiwan is particularly dangerous in the context of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\nThe ICAO, like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.N. itself, refuses to recognize Taiwan's sovereignty as part of its relationship with China. China considers Taiwan a rogue province under its legitimate control despite the fact that Taiwan is fully independent of Beijing and the island has never in history formed part of the People's Republic. Beijing insists that any state seeking diplomatic relations with China, or any international body seeking its cooperation, ignore Taiwan's sovereignty and reject any attempts by the Taiwanese government to establish ties.\n\nThe head of the ICAO, Secretary-General Fang Liu, was formerly an aviation official for the Chinese Communist Party. The Party has a history of disappearing its alums who go on to head international organizations if they do not strictly obey its commands, even abroad.\n\nTaiwan has documented eight cases of the new coronavirus – which causes respiratory system damage, pneumonia, and death – as of Wednesday morning, according to its government. The WHO considers Taiwan a province of China and thus does not distinguish Taiwanese cases as separate from the nearly 6,000 cases documented in that country. The virus has killed 132 people at press time, all within China. Most cases have been documented in Wuhan, the central Chinese metropolis where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\nTaiwan operates some of the world's busiest airports and, close to some of the hardest-hit provinces in southern China, is geographically critical to monitoring travelers and containing the virus. Yet the ICAO, which claims to be playing a supporting role in U.N. coronavirus response, rejects any attempts by Taipei to join the global conversation on how to contain the outbreak.\n\nThe Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported on Tuesday that the growing scandal surrounding the ICAO began on Saturday, when user Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, revealed that the ICAO blocked her on Twitter after she questioned the organization's exclusion of Taiwan from coronavirus response measures.\n\nHey everyone, check this out– I've been blocked by the International Civil Aviation Organization (@icao), a @UN specialized agency, for assumedly tweeting about the need for Taiwan's inclusion (not membership) in light of a global health crisis. 1/ pic.twitter.com/yEZur36xvp — Jessica Drun (@jessicadrun) January 25, 2020\n\nDrun had originally questioned both the ICAO and the WHO, writing, Want to drive the point home that two orgs, @WHO & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ Taiwan authorities. This means civil aviation authorities for one of busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential ICAO-WHO efforts. This is how a virus spreads.\n\nFollowing Drun's revelation that the ICAO had blocked her, several others also objecting to Taiwan's exclusion reported having the same experience. Others criticized the ICAO for not doing enough to save lives and instead received ill-timed mockery.\n\nAs reports of the ICAO blocking users concerned about the coronavirus outbreak spread, American officials issued statements condemning the United Nations organization. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives issued a statement on Twitter on Monday denouncing the ICAO for silencing dissent.\n\nThe United Nation's @icao plays a valuable role in ensuring aviation security. But silencing voices that oppose ICAO's exclusion of Taiwan goes against their stated principles of fairness, inclusion, and transparency, the Twitter post read. Individual members of Congress also expressed outrage at the U.N. organization, which is tasked with representing the interests of all global civilians, silencing legitimate questions on its treatment of Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry thanked those supporting its inclusion in the global response to coronavirus on Twitter. The ministry has also lodged a solemn protest before the ICAO, which is headquartered in Canada.\n\nSupporting #Taiwan's inclusion in @icao is communicating misinformation? 🙈🙉🙊 & then the Taiwan issue will just disappear? No! Taiwan will remain an air traffic hub & the only way to ensure safety is inclusion. JW https://t.co/2nLhUXKAZk — 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) January 28, 2020\n\nSpeaking to the HKFP, ICAO communications director Anthony Philbin claimed that those individuals blocked on Twitter were deemed to be purposefully and publicly misrepresenting our organization in order to draw attention to their own campaign objectives. He added that the ICAO is allegedly fully bound by the fact that the U.N. General Assembly, the organization's largest body, has rejected the reality of Taiwanese sovereignty.\n\nOn Twitter, the ICAO repeatedly referred to support for Taiwan as spam:\n\nDue to an unusually large amount of spam, we are unfortunately unable to answer genuine queries at this time. As we are committed to empowering the public, media and civil society through information sharing, we regret the inconvenience. — ICAO (@icao) January 28, 2020\n\nWe understand peer pressure, but we only block people for doing uncool stuff, like sending us spam. — ICAO (@icao) January 27, 2020\n\nThe ICAO's rejection of Taiwan mirrors that of the World Health Organization, which as openly rejected any information Taiwan has to offer or expertise in handling the coronavirus. Chinese President Tsai Ing-wen demanded the country's rightful place at the international body last week as China admitted, nearly a month after privately notifying the WHO, that it had identified a new strain of virus.\n\nPolitical considerations should not surpass protection for the people, Tsai said. I want to again urge the WHO not to exclude Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is on the front line of global infectious disease prevention. The WHO should have a space for Taiwan's participation.\n\nThe WHO rescinded Taiwan's invitation to its annual World Health Assembly in the aftermath of Tsai's election. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) discourages cooperation with China that requires disregarding the nation's sovereignty and actively rejects Beijing's proposal to install One Country, Two Systems, the policy currently in place in Hong Kong, on the island.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
In a recent thread on his own platform, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed the recent suspension of President Donald Trump, stating that he believes it was the right decision and that the mass blacklisting of Trump by the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe was not coordinated, writing More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\nIn a recent tweet thread, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed the company's recent decision to permanently suspend President Trump from its platform. The company stated last week that President Trump was suspended from the platform due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\n\nNow, Dorsey has discussed the decision at length in a tweet thread which can be found here. Dorsey wrote in the thread:\n\nI do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct? I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\n\nDorsey went on to say that the ban had significant ramifications, adding that while there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.\n\nHe further added that he didn't believe that the mass de-platforming of President Trump was coordinated, stating: I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\nDorsey finished the tweet thread stating: I believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. I also recognize it does not feel that way today. Everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together.\n\nBreitbart News recently reported that Twitter stock dropped by as much as 12.3 percent on Monday morning this week, reaching a low as $45.17 per share.\n\nIt was noted by multiple analysts that the decision to suspend President Trump could reignite legislation to revoke Section 230, which protects internet companies from liability for content users posts according to analyst notes. Bank of America Securities analysts said in a note to clients: While a Democratic administration may be less focused on significant reform of Section 230, recent events may make content legislation more likely.\n\nRead more at Breitbart News here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Friday on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports, Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC's Meet the Press, said one of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's vulnerabilities is the miscalculation to topple Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi because it helped to create the dangerous conditions that lead to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack.\n\nTodd said, Competency has been her strength but I do believe what Benghazi and Libya present was this was an example of her being miscalculating, the policy was wrong. I've always believed she's more vulnerable than on the policy than on what happened. You know, why was Benghazi a dangerous situation? Because of the decision to topple Qaddafi. That has always been her real policy vulnerability there. I actually think the incompetent tag, I see what he's trying to do there.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Iraqis celebrated in the streets after the head of Iran's Quds military force Qasem Soleimani was killed in an airstrike on Thursday night.\n\nFootage of Iraqis celebrating in the streets was shared by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as they waved the Iraqi flag and cheered the news.\n\nOther videos were shared claiming to be footage of Iraqis celebrating in the streets.\n\nA TV correspondent from Alhurrra News noted that some Iraqis were baking cakes to thank President Trump.\n\nSulaimani was reportedly responsible for ordering the quelling of Iraqi protests resulting in hundreds of deaths and injured protesters.\n\nElizabeth Tsurkov, a member of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, noted Syrians were celebrating the news.\n\nSoleimani probably has more blood on his hands (mostly of Syrians and Iraqis), than any other Middle Eastern leader, she wrote.
President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan responded vigorously to a speech this week by Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping announcing that China would no longer tolerate Taiwan's sovereignty, urging Xi to bravely move towards democracy and face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China.\n\nIn his speech on Tuesday, Xi called Taiwanese independence a dead end and warned that, in 2019, China would no longer accept the status quo.\n\nWe make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he warned.\n\nTsai, speaking on Wednesday, responded by lamenting that China has consistently rejected the democratic values that, according to her, define the national identity of Taiwan and condemned China for spending much of 2018 attempting to bribe Taiwan's allies away from recognizing the nation's sovereignty.\n\nDemocratic values are the values and way of life that Taiwanese cherish, and we call upon China to bravely move towards democracy, Tsai declared. This is the only way they can truly understand Taiwanese people's ideas and commitments.\n\nTsai called on China to face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and not deny the democratic system that the people of Taiwan have established together. She insisted that Taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems,' the policy in place for Hong Kong, which nominally allows Hong Kong to remain democratic but technically deprives it of sovereignty. Xi's regime has increasingly crippled Hong Kong's ability to govern itself under one country, two systems by banning political candidates anathema to the Communist Party's interest from running for office.\n\nTsai also implied that China's behavior towards Taiwan, particularly since she took over as president in 2016, had brought it international embarrassment. I want to remind the Beijing authorities that a superpower must act with the demeanor and take the responsibility of a superpower, she noted, and international society is watching China to see if it can make changes and become a trustworthy partner.\n\nPressuring international corporations to change their designation for Taiwan won't bring about a spiritual union, nor will buying off Taiwan's diplomatic allies or circling Taiwan with military aircraft and naval vessels, Tsai concluded.\n\nThe latter remark referred to China's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. Throughout 2018, companies such as Ikea, American Airlines, and Marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying Taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive Chinese market. Three major airlines in the United States ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying Taiwan as a country even as the U.S. government dismissed China's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. Marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a Twitter post by a group called Friends of Tibet, which opposes communism.\n\nChina has also used its Belt and Road initiative (BRI, or One Belt, One Road) to offer high-interest loans to nations that maintain friendly relations with Taiwan, notably in Latin America. Nations like the Dominican Republic and El Salvador announced last year they no longer recognized Taiwan's sovereignty after lucrative business meetings with Beijing's representatives. An enraged Tsai warned the world in August that China's increasingly out of control behavior was not only a threat to cross-strait peace … [but] caused high levels of global instability.\n\nTsai's speech on Wednesday followed new year's remarks from Xi Jinping warning that 2019 would be the last year China would tolerate Taiwan's existence.\n\nReunification is a historical trend and it is the right path. Taiwan independence is an adverse current of history and is a dead end, Xi announced. The issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics. It is a core interest of China, and the … feelings of the Chinese people, and foreign interference is intolerable.\n\nHe added that Chinese officials make no promise to abandon the use of force to end Taiwan's independence.\n\nAsked about the aggressive remarks on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang claimed to reporters that Xi was not speaking for China, but for the world.\n\nXi made it very clear in his speech that adherence to the one-China principle is a consensus shared by the international community, Lu said. The international community generally understands and supports the just cause of the Chinese people in opposing 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities and realizing national reunification.\n\nWe make no promise to renounce the use of force. This does not target compatriots in Taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of 'Taiwan independence' separatists and their activities, he added, likely alluding to the United States as an external force against Beijing's interests on the matter.\n\nThe threat of use of force is not new for Xi's regime. In October, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said during remarks to the press that if someone tries to separate out Taiwan, China's military will take the necessary actions at any cost. Two months later, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly deployed a significantly larger fleet of naval vessels to the Taiwan Strait, presumably to surround Taiwan's military and intimidate U.S. ships in the area. The Chinese Foreign Ministry argued this was necessary because a U.S. Navy ship had traveled through the sovereign Vietnamese waters in the South China Sea, which China has illegally claimed for itself.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
Pro-life groups oppose a Democrat spending bill on Thursday that increases money for abortion programs while including no increased border wall funding.\n\nThe House Democrat majority plans to vote on a spending bill that will end the partial government spending program. The spending bill includes a provision that repeals a provision instituted by President Donald Trump that would require foreign non-government organizations (NGOs) to assure that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nThe stipulation, known as the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, used to be called the Mexico City policy, known by some critics as the global gag rule.\n\nThe Democrat bill increases the United Nations Population Fund by $5 million to $37.5 million. Pro-life groups contend that the program leads to coercive abortions and involuntary sterilizations.\n\nThe legislation also increases funding for the United Nations Populations Fund, which provides contraception and hopes to reduce childhood deaths. Trump ended American financing for the group because pro-life groups oppose its relationship with China, which discourages its citizens from having more than two children.\n\nThe legislation mirrors some of the provisions contained in the Senate Appropriations Committee spending bill, which passed through the committee unanimously. The bill does not include President Trump's requested $5 billion in border wall funding.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said that Democrats are already trying to foist a radical pro-abortion agenda on the nation.\n\nA strong majority of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, Dannenfelser said.\n\nThe leader of the Susan B. Anthony List said that repealing Trump's policy would make taxpayers complicit in the exportation of abortion and destruction of countless unborn children around the world. This is unconscionable, and we oppose the bill in the strongest terms.\n\nThe Democrat spending bill faces slim prospects of passing through the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he would only put a vote on the Chamber's floor if President Trump endorsed the bill and it included border wall funding.\n\nMatt Wolking, communications director for Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), tweeted on Thursday that Nancy Pelosi will not provide money to protect Americans from illegal immigrants; however, she will increase funding for abortion.\n\nNancy Pelosi's funding plan won't provide a single dollar to protect Americans from being murdered by illegal immigrants, Wolking wrote. But it will provide $5 million dollars for a UN program that promotes abortion and the forced sterilization of people of color:
Former longtime Univision anchor María Elena Salinas revealed on Tuesday evening that many Latinos are buying the arguments President Donald Trump is making about illegal immigration.\n\nSalinas, whom the New York Times once described as the voice of Hispanic America, told CNN host Don Lemon after Trump's Tuesday evening Oval Office address that she is saddened that Latinos are buying some of these arguments against undocumented immigrants that Trump has been making.\n\nAnd it's very sad to see that our own people, who are immigrants themselves, are attacking these immigrants that are trying to come in, knowing themselves how difficult the situation is in a lot of these Latin American countries, she continued. And, you know, they're buying it, and some people, just like some other Trump supporters, are saying, well, you know, so what if he tells lies, as long as we have lower unemployment among the Latino community.\n\nIn his Oval Office address, Trump specifically mentioned that illegal immigration hurts African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nIt strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages, Trump said of illegal immigration. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump, in addition to making the economic case for fewer illegal immigrants, also explicitly pointed out that the media often ignore Latino families who have been victimized by illegal immigrant crimes.\n\nTrump ended up shocking the political and media establishments by doing better among Hispanic voters than Mitt Romney did four years before. And though the media have tried to vilify Trump as a racist who hates brown people, Trump's support among Latinos has remained steady.\n\nA December Associated Press report pointed out the GOP's position among Hispanics has not weakened during the Trump administration, despite the president's rhetoric against immigrants and the party's shift to the right on immigration.\n\nThough Latino voters are a key part of the Democratic coalition, there is a larger bloc of reliable Republican Latinos than many think, the Associated Press explained.\n\nAP's VoteCast data from the 2018 midterm elections reportedly found that  32 percent of Latinos voted for Republicans while other midterm election surveys also found roughly one-third of Latinos supporting the GOP.\n\nThe Associated Press noted that the stability of Republicans' share of the Latino vote frustrates Democrats, who say actions like Trump's family separation policy and his demonization of an immigrant caravan should drive Latinos out of the GOP.
The Times of Israel reports: U.S. President Donald Trump sent his peace envoy back to the Middle East on Tuesday in a move seen as a sign that he intends to make a push for a peace deal.\n\nThe envoy Jason Greenblatt met late Tuesday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at a resort on the Dead Sea in Jordan, which is hosting this week's Arab League summit. Abbas's spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeinah described it as a follow-up meeting to exchange ideas, according to the official PA news agency Wafa. Abbas heads to Washington for his first meeting with the new president in the next few weeks.\n\nGreenblatt also met with a series of Arab leaders and is expected to hold further talks on Wednesday as the summit starts. Ahead of those meetings, Greenblatt met with European Union Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini for talks focused on advancing the Israel-Palestinian track. It's a priority for both of us, he tweeted.\n\nRead more here.
The Algemeiner reports: JNS.org – May 2017 set a monthly record for the number of tourists arriving in Israel. Since the start of 2017, tourism has infused $2.18 billion into the Israeli economy, according to figures published Thursday by Israel's Tourism Ministry. The month of May saw 347,000 tourists enter Israel, an increase of 16.7 percent from May 2016.\n\nTourism Minister Yariv Levin attributed the tourism boom to the Israeli government's marketing efforts.\n\nIt's not a coincidence; it's a clear policy, he said. The positive trend that has continued for over six months is making a tremendous contribution to Israeli employment and the economy, and I'm convinced that if we work correctly, we'll see this trend continue into the coming months.\n\nRead more here.
Finland's much-celebrated experiment in rolling out Universal Basic Income (UBI), a proposed replacement for out-of-work benefits in post-industrial nations where all citizens are paid by the government regardless of their income, is to end as the local government seeks other alternatives to welfare reform.\n\nThe limited trial which began in 2017 selected 2,000 unemployed Finns to receive a monthly payment of €560, regardless of whether they consequently found employment or not. Rather than expand the experiment to more jobseekers, the Finnish government has instead decided to let the trial expire at the end of 2018, signalling the end of the road in the Nordic nation for UBI.\n\nThe BBC reports the remarks of Finnish UBI designer Professor Olli Kangas, who said: The eagerness of the government is evaporating. They rejected extra funding [for it]… I'm a little disappointed that the government decided not to expand it.\n\nThe exact reasons why Finland decided not to extend the trial against the advice of Professor Kangas are not yet known and won't be revealed until after the project is completed in 2019, but the news will be a disappointment to many who saw UBI as a new and enhanced way force increased taxation levels and redistribute wealth.\n\nThe concept has proven popular with Silicon Valley elites, with the hyper-wealthy Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as well as Slack CEO and Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield joining together to endorse UBI in the United States, with Zuckerberg stating giving all citizens tax money would give everyone a cushion to try new things.\n\nOthers have argued that UBI will become necessary when increasing automation in the workplace renders some human work redundant, creating — it is claimed — mass-unemployment.\n\nYet findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) may hold some answers to the early end of Finland's experiment — after the report showed that basic income paid by the government could actually increase inequality rather than solve it, and would require a 30 per cent income tax rise to pay for the policy.
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Three days before the critical New Hampshire Primary, seven Democratic presidential candidates debated, with many of them fighting to survive in the race to challenge President Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some key takeaways.\n\nMAYOR PETE MAKES HIS CASE\n\nPete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend., Ind., was the candidate of the moment Friday. All eyes were on him Friday night to see if he could make his case.\n\nAnd he did — with one significant stumble.\n\nAttacked for his thin resume, Buttigieg shot back, If you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington, D.C., experience under their belt, that candidate is not me. He promoted his youth compared with the lawmakers onstage talking their achievements from decades ago.\n\nWe cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, Buttigieg said. We have to be ready to turn the page.\n\nA former military intelligence officer, Buttigieg seemed comfortable discussing foreign affairs, such as the Trump administration's killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. There is no evidence that that made our country safer, he said, adding later, This is not an episode of '24.'\n\nBut Buttigieg's trouble spot has long been race. Asked about a spike in arrests of black people for marijuana possession in his city after he became mayor, Buttigieg began to decry systemic racism but seemed to acknowledge he couldn't escape it in the city that he ran.\n\nSANDERS UNDER ATTACK\n\nIt didn't take long for the candidates to make clear whom they saw as the front-runner. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was piled on by competitors fighting to become the moderate alternative to the self-declared democratic socialist.\n\nThere were two lines of attack — Sanders' uncompromising liberal positions and, specifically, his proposal to immediately have the federal government take over the entire health care system.\n\nThe most notable punch was thrown by Buttigieg, who said Democrats will have a problem working to unite this country at a moment when we need unification when our nominee is dividing people. Asked if he meant Sanders, he said yes.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar scoffed at Sanders' health care proposal. Former Vice President Joe Biden noted that Sanders says he has no idea how much his proposal could cost, though experts have put it at at least $30 trillion.\n\nBut he showed a characteristic durability. In the deeply divided field, Sanders is now leading in many polls by virtue of that following.\n\nBIDEN BOUNCE BACK?\n\nAfter his disappointing showing in Iowa, Biden was fighting to survive. Sometimes it didn't seem like it, but Biden also displayed flashes of the fire and emotion that have traditionally endeared him to Democratic voters.\n\nOffered a chance early to swing at his two main rivals — Sanders and Buttigieg — Biden opened by basically admitting he was going to lose New Hampshire.\n\nBernie won by 20 points last time, Biden said softly. His criticisms of Sanders and Buttigieg weren't nearly as sharp as those offered by other candidates. Biden's had difficulty talking about the GOP investigation into his own son that triggered Trump's impeachment and that has coincided with the former vice president's slide in the polls.\n\nThe former vice president was left asking the crowd to give a standing ovation to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was led out of the White House hours earlier. Vindman had testified in December before Democrats investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBiden, 77, was more energized in the later hours of the debate. He was visibly enraged at Trump's dismissive comments on U.S. casualties during the Iranian retaliation for the U.S. killing of an Iranian general. He sharply attacked Sanders over the Vermont senator's prior support for gun rights, defended his long record on the Supreme Court and promoted his historic support from African-Americans.\n\nBut it's not clear whether his performance will quell worries.\n\nWARREN DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR BREAKING THROUGH\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren invested deeply in neighboring New Hampshire as a key part of her 2020 run, but she struggled to find a standout moment as she begins to make her final case to the state's voters.\n\nWarren skipped a chance to differentiate herself more from Sanders, a fellow progressive whom she calls a longtime friend. Given the chance to create some distance, Warren said, We have a lot of things in common, we have a lot of things that we differ on.\n\nShe quickly shifted to making a party unity plea and echoing her stump speech lines about big money in politics and corruption.\n\nWe bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, Warren said. We're the Democrats. We should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well.\n\nWarren also did little to explicitly come to Sanders defense as her Vermont rival was attacked by the more moderate candidates over his prized Medicare for All policy goal, an idea Warren supports.\n\nKLOBUCHAR MADE A MARK\n\nKlobuchar was quick with the quips as she tried gain an edge in the primary's moderate lane. She repeatedly made a virtue of her ability to compromise and work with Republicans. There was an urgency to her presentation, with good reason: She needs an upset in New Hampshire.\n\nShe hit familiar notes of criticizing Medicare for All as she touted her Midwestern appeal and legislative success in the Senate. Klobuchar's plea boiled down to making a case for Democratic sensibility as a break from the smash-mouth nature of Trump's presidency.\n\nI didn't come from money, Klobuchar said, insisting voters want to have someone that they can understand in the White House.\n\nSTEYER'S FIERY PLAY … FOR SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nBillionaire activist Tom Steyer does not have much of a chance in New Hampshire. So he used the debate to make a strong appeal to African American voters in South Carolina, where his campaign has invested heavily and black voters make up two-thirds of the primary electorate.\n\nThe billionaire noted that well into the debate, we have not said one word tonight about race.\n\nAre you kidding me? he asked as a discussion of race ensued.\n\nHe added later, I am for reparations to African Americans in this country and anyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.\n\nYANG NOT BURDENED\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang was not burdened by low expectations. He was at ease and having fun on the debate stage Friday night, even though his chances to win New Hampshire, let alone the Democratic nomination, are minuscule.\n\nHe bounced onto the stage without a tie, in stark contrast to his more buttoned-up male rivals.\n\nBut Yang was largely left out of the heated exchanges that simmered through the debate, focusing instead on stepping back and looking at the larger picture.\n\nDonald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, Yang said. And we are making a mistake when we act like he is. He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT NOT IN THE ROOM\n\nTwo words were spoken Friday night that have rarely come up on the trail or in prior debates: Mike Bloomberg.\n\nThe former New York mayor and multibillionaire is skipping the early nominating states and instead spending hundreds of millions on Super Tuesday states with far more delegates at stake.\n\nA viewer-submitted question asked why the candidates were better than Bloomberg.\n\nI don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States, Warren said.\n\nI just simply don't think people look at the guy in the White House and say, 'Can we get someone richer?' Klobuchar said.\n\nThere are millions of people who can desire to run for office but I guess if you're worth $60 billion and you can spend several hundred millions of dollars on advertising you have a slight advantage, Sanders said.\n\nThe responses were clear signals that they take Bloomberg seriously.
British exports are at their strongest since 2010, according to a report by Heathrow Airport and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) — making a mockery of claims that post-referendum uncertainty would crash the economy.\n\nThe value of export goods destined for markets beyond the European Union and Switzerland have risen by some 150 per cent, with Heathrow carrying £48.9 billion — or 30 per cent — of this cargo, City A.M. reports.\n\nJohn Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive officer, said that the figures proved that Britain needs to secure its status as an outward-looking global trading nation — although he stopped short of calling out the EU loyalists in Parliament seeking to tie Britain to an EU customs deal which could see the bloc continuing to set Britain's trade policy.\n\nTrade is so brisk, in fact, Heathrow is operating at capacity, with Holland-Kaye claiming that the airport must expand so we can connect all corners of the UK to the growing markets of the world.\n\nBrexit Boom: Manufacturing Set to Outpace the Rest of Economy as Exports Surge https://t.co/4ScfRGG0pD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2018\n\nThe figures are just the latest nail in the already overcrowded coffin lid of the Remain campaign's Project Fear, whose centrepiece was a Treasury report warning voters that a Leave vote would inflict an immediate and profound shock to the British economy, tipping the country into recession and putting hundreds of thousands out of work.\n\nIn fact, the economy has continued to grow post-referendum, with factory output especially strong as the fall in sterling lets the air out of what Princeton University academic Ashoka Mody described as a finance-property bubble and redirects economic activity towards manufacturing and exports.\n\nBreitbart London reported on March 5th that manufacturing growth is now expected to outpace the rest of the economy, with international firms such as Siemens and Unilever announcing multi-million-pound plants and research centres, expected to create thousands of new jobs.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a coronavirus plan Thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.\n\nThe proposal reflects the priorities of Democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. It also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by Democrats long before the pandemic struck.\n\nThe proposal includes:\n\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\n\n$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education\n\nDirect payments of $1,400 to most Americans, costing around $320 billion according to a Breitbart News' estimate\n\nEnhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of September\n\n$50 billion for Covid-19 testing\n\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\n\nRaising the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\n\nThe non-spending proposals include:\n\nHiking the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\n\nExtending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September\n\nExtended family leave\n\nCalled the American Rescue Plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. Despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building American infrastructure.\n\nThose things will have to wait for a second bill that Biden says will be introduced in February, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.\n\nThe proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. Instead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.\n\nThe proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. Biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for K-12 schools and colleges.\n\nUnder Biden's multipronged strategy, only about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.\n\nBiden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.\n\nIn an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income Americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term Democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. That is likely to make it harder for low-income Americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.\n\nThe proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.\n\nThe political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.\n\nRemember that a bipartisan $900 billion #COVID19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago, tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\n\nThe emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. Inflation is below the Federal Reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.\n\nBiden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. Our work begins with getting COVID under control, he declared in his victory speech. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.\n\nDespite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the Trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. Re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.\n\nThe plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.\n\nAbout $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.\n\nThe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThere's also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, and to help track new virus strains, including the more contagious variants identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n\nThroughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.\n\nWith the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.\n\nBiden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. He contends it's still the surest way to slow the COVID-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.\n\nBiden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead, said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.\n\nWith the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.\n\nBiden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.\n\nThis is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.\n\nBiden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.\n\nIt's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said Gracia.\n\nNext Wednesday, when Biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press and AP writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.
When it comes to setting policy in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry is not taken seriously and is laughed at in the larger Middle East, Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter Aaron Klein stated in a radio interview on Wednesday.\n\nKlein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor's popular national radio show.\n\nClick below to listen to Klein's full segment on Batchelor's program.\n\nKlein, reporting from Tel Aviv, told Batchelor that he heard the anti-Kerry sentiment from diplomats in the region regarding U.S. policy in Syria:\n\nWhat I'm hearing is that the Middle East right now is entirely disappointed by John Kerry, by the United States. There is no leadership. There is almost nothing being done on the American side. America has almost completely abandoned Syria to Russia; to what Russia wants in the ceasefire agreement. … The United States has been largely absent. …\n\nJohn Kerry, by the way, is not taken seriously in the Middle East and beyond. He's laughed at. There is no policy. He hasn't presented anything serious.\n\nKerry has been attempting to broker a ceasefire agreement in Syria. But Klein says it is Russian President Vladimir Putin who has taken the leadership position in trying to arrange a vaguely-defined halt in hostilities scheduled to take effect Saturday.\n\nThe Guardian reported:\n\nThe Russian president spoke by phone to leaders in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Syria in an attempt to garner support for the ceasefire, and explain its complex details.\n\nHe has also opened a coordination centre to which the warring parties can send complaints of specific breaches of the truce.\n\nThe truce will not apply to zones controlled by the Islamic State and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.\n\nHowever, Klein said ceasefire efforts may be complicated by the Assad regime's insistence on labeling rebel groups as terrorists.\n\nKlein is not the only one mocking Kerry's Syria diplomacy. Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, was quoted stating, The only one holding out hope is John Kerry.\n\nRight now, it's hypothetical and not based on anything real. How Kerry even explained it in his own words, it's hard to take seriously, Hamid stated.\n\nKlein, however, was speaking to what he said was the absence of a larger cohesive U.S. policy in Syria.\n\nOn Thursday, Kerry cited previously unheard Pentagon estimates essentially making public the dim chances of creating any future safe-zone or no-fly-zone in Syria.\n\nABC News reported:\n\nKerry said today that creating a safe zone isn't as simple as it sounds. In addition to controlling the airspace, Kerry said, a large troop presence would be required to shield the population from ISIS attacks on the ground.\n\nAll this talk about safe zones does not go through the process of what it really means, Kerry said.\n\nOur Pentagon estimates that to have a true safe zone in the north of the country you may have upwards of fifteen to thirty thousand troops. Now are we ready to authorize that? Are we ready to put them on the ground?\n\nAside from the inherent physical and political risks of putting a large number of U.S. troops on the ground inside Syria, the U.S. worries about potential conflicts with Russia, which is also conducting an aerial bombing campaign over Syria.\n\nCreating a no-fly zone would most likely mean the U.S. would have to enforce that rule against Russian jets – a potentially dangerous scenario.\n\nNevertheless, Kerry said that the U.S. is considering other options if a ceasefire can't be reached inside Syria.
LAS VEGAS (AP) — As early voting surged in Nevada's nominating contest, former Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday for not doing enough to control his most aggressive supporters.\n\nBiden's attack during an interview for NBC's Meet The Press came as he fights to rescue his struggling presidential bid and Sanders works to strengthen his strong standing with the contest speeding into a new phase. Biden also sought to downplay expectations for next Saturday's Nevada caucuses, telling reporters that he did not need to win.\n\nIn the interview, the former vice president seized on reports that Sanders' supporters insulted and made online threats against leaders of an influential union that declined to endorse any of the eight candidates still in the Democratic race.\n\nHe may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability, Biden charged. He continued: If any of my supporters did that, I'd disown them … flat disown them.\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Biden's assertion.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the fiery progressive senator went on the offensive against his moderate competitors for accepting campaign cash from billionaires, although he declined to go after his opponents by name.\n\nDemocracy is not candidates going to the homes of billionaires raising money, Sanders charged during a rally at a suburban Las Vegas high school.\n\nBoth Biden and Pete Buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. Buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in Seattle at roughly the same time Sanders made the comments.\n\nIt was a familiar line of attack in a relatively unfamiliar setting as the 2020 primary contest descended upon Nevada for a weekend of frenzied campaigning, colored by mobile campaign billboards cruising the Las Vegas strip and a diverse set of voters weighing in for the first time.\n\nWhile the state's formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, Democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. State party officials at some sites across Nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.\n\nIn northern Nevada's Washoe County, a line of more than 300 people snaked through aisles of book shelves at a public library as another 100 queued up at the county party's headquarters. Dozens left without voting.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Nevada Democrats, Molly Forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after Iowa's presidential caucuses turned disastrous.\n\nWe are happy to see the number of energized Democrats participating in our first ever early voting period, Forgey said, noting that early voters have four days to participate. Our volunteers and staff are working to make every site runs as efficiently as possible and to ensure every voter gets to make their voice heard.\n\nEarly votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on Feb. 22, when Democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. The Nevada State Democratic Party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in Iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.\n\nAmid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the Las Vegas-based Clark County Democratic Party to feature a half-dozen White House hopefuls.\n\nBiden, looking to Nevada's diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, seized on President Donald Trump's hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.\n\nEverybody knows how Donald Trump is. We gotta let him know who we are, Biden said, drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a Las Vegas middle school gymnasium for a Latino organizing event.\n\nBiden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the Latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. He later told reporters that he didn't need to win Nevada's caucuses to mount a comeback.\n\nI just have to do well, the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. Asked whether he has to win, he replied, No, I don't think I have to, but I think we have a shot at winning.\n\nFormer Sen. Harry Reid, an icon in Nevada's Democratic politics, told reporters that people should not be counting Joe Biden out of the race yet, but also offered warm words for Sanders' candidacy. When asked he downplayed concerns from some Democrats that Sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.\n\nI care a great deal about Bernie Sanders. And he has gotten where he has by having people support him, said the 80-year-old Reid. And so I'm not going to be critical of Bernie Sanders.\n\nElizabeth Warren, meanwhile, also reeling after a weak performance last week in New Hampshire, looked to Nevada's women for momentum.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator pitched her universal childcare plan as she addressed about 30 people, mostly women, at a downtown Las Vegas reggae and cocktail bar. After being introduced by actress Yvette Nicole Brown, Warren said her childcare plan would be paid for by a wealth tax of 2 cents on every dollar for fortunes of more than $50 million.\n\nIt's good for our babies, Warren said. Think about what it means for every mama. Every mama who can now finish her education, even if she's just had a baby. Every mama and every daddy who could take a job.\n\nMike Bloomberg, who isn't competing in Nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for Wednesday's presidential debate in La Vegas. The billionaire businessman and former New York mayor has increasingly become a target of the Democratic Party's far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders criticized the role of big money in politics and billionaires seeking the presidency. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer are in that category.\n\nDemocracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. Democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice, Sanders declared.\n\nThe campaign of Bloomberg, who campaigned Saturday in Virginia, announced the opening of seven new campaign offices in Florida, bringing the total to 10. The former New York mayor has more than 2,000 paid staff spread out across the nation and has already spent over $300 million on TV, radio and digital advertising, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from New York.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is releasing from custody more than 2,000 border-crossing adults and the children they arrived with over the course of a few weeks.\n\nA DHS official confirmed to Breitbart News that the U.S. Border Patrol and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is releasing more than 2,000 family units caught at the U.S.-Mexico border, citing a lack of detention space.\n\nThe border-crossing adults and the children they arrived at the border with will be released and given a court date for an immigration hearing. The adults will be given ankle monitors, though the DHS official says the process of keeping track of border-crossers via ankle monitors is not effective.\n\nBorder Patrol and ICE are experiencing major issues with detention space at the Yuma, Arizona sector of the border, as well as in San Diego, California, El Paso, Texas, and the Rio Grande Valley sector of the southern border.\n\nThe DHS official said there is not nearly enough bed space for family units at border detention facilities, while Border Patrol encounters about 2,100 border-crossers a day with more than 60 percent of those adults bringing children with them in the hope to be quickly released into the interior of the country.\n\nPhotos captured over the last couple of weeks reveal the mass release of border-crossing family units by DHS:\n\nA DHS spokesperson blamed the country's immigration loophole, known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, in a statement to Breitbart News.\n\nWe are living through an immigration crisis that is in part driven by a disastrous ruling by a district court judge in the Ninth Circuit that incentives illegal alien adults to put their children in the hands of smugglers and traffickers, Waldman told Breitbart News in a statement. The Flores Settlement Agreement has created an immigration loophole that rewards parents for bringing their children with them to the United States.\n\nThe Flores Settlement Agreement — to which the President Trump's administration has demanded an end — requires border-crossing family units to be released after 20 days, even before their immigration hearing. The result is a growing illegal alien population, as less than two percent of border-crossing family units are deported.\n\nSince 2015, we have seen a 169 percent increase in family units crossing the border. There has been a 110 percent increase in males traveling with children over the last two years, Waldman said. As long as activist judges continue to set national immigration policy they continue to put family units and innocent children in harm's way.\n\nAs the Trump administration mass releases border-crossing family units, illegal immigration continues surging at the southern border. Breitbart News's Bob Price reports that about 22,000 border-crossing minors crossed the border last month.\n\nIn November 2018, there were close to 52,000 border crossings on the southern border, alone, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade.
International human rights lawyer Anne Bayefsky reported on UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's latest statement about the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday's Breitbart News Daily. Bayefsky expressed disappointment with the mild character of Haley's brief remarks, compared to the boldness of her earlier criticism of the Council.\n\nI'm afraid that she didn't say very much. She was very hopeful. Her attitude was one of hope that the Human Rights Council would do a better job going forward, Bayefsky said of Haley's remarks.\n\nIt was a very short speech. You get very little time at the Human Rights Council to speak, so she couldn't say very much of anything, she noted.\n\nShe might have said that unless the Council does A, B, C, the United States will remove itself, but she didn't say that. She said that Venezuela should voluntarily step down, which of course is completely and utterly unrealistic. She said no human rights violator should be on the Council, should be allowed to take a seat. That isn't going to happen because the General Assembly and the Council itself determines who are its members, and they have no intention of changing their procedures, Bayefsky noted.\n\nAnd she said it's essential that the Council address its anti-Israel bias, but again, U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations have said that for the last three decades, to no avail. There was no 'or else,' she said.\n\nSiriusXM host Joel Pollak noted that Haley's hopeful tone was not dramatically different from the Obama administration's attitude when it decided to improve the Human Rights Council by re-joining it and working from within. He asked if those years of effort had produced any positive changes.\n\nThat's a good question, Bayefsky replied. First of, they didn't 'rejoin' because President Bush had never joined. It was created in 2006. Obama, it was one of his very first foreign policy moves to join it, to lend it credibility. He left President Trump holding the bag because he ran the United States for a three-year term that began only on January 1, 2017, hoping to essentially rule from the grave. So they were faced with an issue of whether to get off it from the get-go at the Trump administration, and they didn't.\n\nThe Obama administration made very specific reform efforts to A) change the composition so that countries like Saudi Arabia and so on were not members, and secondly they attempted to change the entrenched anti-Israel bias. They failed miserably on both counts, she said.\n\nTo see Ambassador Haley raise this as a potential viable reform effort is unfortunate because she's playing a shell game. She doesn't have the votes, the United States doesn't have the votes. The procedures don't permit those kinds of reforms. There is a complete lack of political will, and it isn't going to happen, Bayefsky contended.\n\nThe current situation is that the Council is collecting a blacklist of American and other companies doing business with the state of Israel, and when we're on it, the American taxpayer is paying for that blacklist. It's shameful. We shouldn't be anywhere granting the kind of legitimacy that the leader of the free world brings to the table at the Human Rights Council, she urged.\n\nIt is possible to still go there and give speeches, non-members can still do that, even co-sponsor resolutions, she noted. But to lend our money and our clout, in terms of membership, is completely inexcusable.\n\nPollak asked for President Trump's options, if he decides not to wait until America's three-year membership in the Human Rights Council expires.\n\nHe could withdraw tomorrow, Bayefsky replied, noting with a chuckle that the deadline for withdrawing today has passed. He has very clear options. He could say, 'The United States taxpayer is no longer going to pay for this travesty that builds equality rights on the backs of inequality of Jews. We're going to get off now.' That's the first option.\n\nOption Number Two is to play the reform game, which the UN enjoys, and has enjoyed for a very long time, she continued. Which simply perpetrates a fraud. I can't put it in any other way. They're not going to do the major reforms necessary – changing of composition and removing of the anti-Israel bias.\n\nBayefsky said the Trump administration could play that reform game until the cows come home, and then simply allow membership in the Human Rights Council to lapse when the current term expires.\n\nThat would have lent the Council another three years of legitimacy, which they don't deserve, she said. And it's not just that. Their demonization of the state of Israel is leading to what we see as anti-Israel bias on college campuses. It gives a license to the BDS, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions regime. It isn't cost-free, and I think that's what we have to understand.\n\nEngagement and the way Nikki Haley has legitimized the Council by going there and giving it that kind of cachet of a U.S. UN ambassador who never goes to Geneva, it's a very unusual move. It has a downside. It simply isn't cost-free. We are now legitimizing it, and every moment we're still there, we're doing the same thing, she cautioned.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
President Donald Trump's administration issued a formal veto threat to Democrats in Congress, vowing to oppose their government funding bill without border security.\n\nIn a statement from the Office of Management and Budget, the administration wrote that they cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.\n\nTrump has demanded that any bill funding the government include $5.6 billion for border security.\n\nThe White House noted that the House Democrat spending bill also undermined the president's Mexico City policy, an executive order that Trump imposed to bar taxpayer funds from subsidizing overseas abortions. The House bill also included funding for the West Bank/Gaza strip as well as Syria and Pakistan and certain United Nations funds, which the administration said were frozen or under review during the Trump administration.\n\nThe administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible, the statement read.\n\nDemocrats took power on Thursday in the House of Representatives, electing Nancy Pelosi as the new Speaker of the House. They planned to pass two bills to fund the government, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to take up the bills without Trump's approval.
Airbnb announced on Monday that it would be reviewing reservations in the Washington DC area ahead of the presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. The company is also cross-referencing arrest records from the Capitol Hill incident with its customer base to ban attendees from using the platform in the future.\n\nCBS News reports that the online rental marketplace Airbnb has announced plans to review reservations in the Washington DC area ahead of next week's presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. The decision comes shortly after city officials asked Airbnb, VRBO, and other rental hosts to remove listings until the January 20 inauguration is over.\n\nWashington city council member Janeese Lewis George said in a Twitter post: There's no way to guarantee that your guests are not coming to incite violence. Please protect your neighbors and the District from more attacks.\n\nAirbnb has had a policy of removing guests that are confirmed to be members of hate groups since 2017 after the company blocked guests who were traveling to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAirbnb stated that it will warn all guests in the Washington area that it may bring legal action against them if they are found to be members of a hate group or planning violent activities. Hosts are also encouraged to call a hotline if they suspect guests are violating Airbnb policies.\n\nAirbnb also announced that anyone who engaged in criminal activity in last week's protest at the U.S. Capitol will be banned from the platform. Airbnb is reportedly cross-referencing arrest records to determine who should be removed from the platform but has not yet stated how many have been banned.\n\nThe company also stated it will not give political donations to Republicans who voted against certifying the results of the election last week, joining Marriot, AT&T, and others in taking that stance. Airbnb's political action committee donated $866,519 to candidates and political parties in the 2020 election cycle, according to Open Secrets. Joe Biden was the biggest recipient of Airbnb donations.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff indicated during his opening remarks at the Senate impeachment trial Wednesday that lawmakers must remove President Donald Trump from office to avoid his reelection in November, claiming that we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.\n\nEchoing other Democrats, Schiff indicated that Democrats are trying to impeach and remove Trump from office to avoid his winning a second term.\n\nSchiff declared:\n\nAs we will discuss, impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise and without urgency at the ballot box. Instead, we are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election. For precisely this reason, the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won:\n\nImpeach him or else he'll win kinda gives the game away https://t.co/gdL9xI7FMF — Ben McDonald (@Bmac0507) January 23, 2020\n\nSchiff served as the chief impeachment inquiry inquisitor in the House. Now, he is one of seven managers arguing the case for convicting and removing Trump in the ongoing Senate trial.\n\nThis week, he argued that if the Senate rejects Democrats' demands for more witnesses, Trump will be considered guilty despite the verdict reached by the Republican-controlled Senate.
CLAIM: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claimed during Tuesday night's Democrat debate that he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world.\n\nVERDICT: Mostly false. Sanders has repeatedly praised communism in Cuba, China, and Nicaragua, with weak caveats acknowledging that they are authoritarian regimes.\n\nSanders aggressively denied supporting authoritarian regimes when asked to justify comments made repeatedly this week praising Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's literacy campaigns, indoctrination plans that forced children to read communist propaganda and worship mass murderers like Ernesto Che Guevara. Sanders never mentioned in his prior supportive comments that Cuba had an extremely high literacy rate before the 1959 communist revolution that did not necessitate the alleged literacy programs.\n\nI have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, Sanders insisted on Tuesday. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba, what I said is what Barack Obama said … that Cuba made progress on education.\n\nSanders then proceeded to yell at the crowd, which booed his support for communism.\n\nReally? Literacy programs are bad? Sanders asked.\n\nOccasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world, Sanders continued, without explaining what his claims of American meddling in Iran and Chile had to do with Fidel Castro's childhood indoctrination schemes.\n\nAfter insisting he has opposed authoritarianism consistently, he then defended authoritarianism on the debate stage.\n\nWhen dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, he said, over the unintelligible shouts of several other candidates on the stage.\n\nI have condemned authoritarianism … authoritarianism of any stripe is bad, but that is different than to say that governments on occasion do things that are good, Sanders concluded.\n\nIn the comments that Sanders defended on the stage – offered to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes Sunday – the socialist senator applauded Cuba and condemned those who criticized Castro for saying everything is bad.\n\nWe're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but, you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad. You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it? he asked.\n\nOn Monday, Sanders offered a similar defense on CNN.\n\n[W]hen Fidel Castro first came to power he initiated a major literacy program. There [were] a lot of folks in Cuba at that point who were illiterate, and he formed a literacy brigade … they went out and they helped people learn to read and write, Sanders said. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world … but, you know, you can't say — China is another example. China is an authoritarian country, becoming more and more authoritarian. But can anyone deny — I mean, the facts are clear, that they have taken more people out of extreme poverty than any country in history.\n\nSanders did not offer his authoritarian caveats in the 1980s remarks that prompted the 60 Minutes interview question on Cuba.\n\nYou may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro, Sanders said at the time. They had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\n\nGranma, the official state newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, approvingly translated Sanders' comments for an article Tuesday applauding him as today one of the strongest aspirants to the Democrat Party nomination to the November presidential election.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
As the presidential race shifts into high gear, college students and recent graduates are still being largely ignored, except by one candidate whose promises of rainbows and unicorns are dreams – not reality.\n\nAs the smartest and, possibly, poorest generation in our nation's history, Millennials will soon have their day of reckoning. Here are the key issues threatening our generation, that we hope the next administration will tackle, so that we, too, can live the American Dream.\n\n1. Colleges are robbing students.\n\nCollege tuition costs have skyrocketed by over 500 percent since 1985. As long as schools continue to tell young people that a degree will guarantee them a better future, they'll keep footing the bill. The government helps them load up on debt – and leaves them with little to no help after the fact.\n\n2. To get a job in America you need to spend money you don't have.\n\nOutstanding student loan debt has reached a staggering $1.2 trillion, with over 70 percent of BA degree graduates borrowing to pay for college. Some 21 million students now each owe an average of $29,400. What's worse, students have rack up all that debt even for jobs that pay $10 an hour. Good luck working that off.\n\n3. That $200,000 degree may not be worth the paper it's printed on.\n\nCollege students graduating today are more likely to work a low-wage job that doesn't require a college degree – the worst imbalance since at least 1990, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven worse, the average median earnings for the class of 2013 was the lowest since 1980, adjusting for inflation.\n\n4. We're kept financially illiterate by a broken education system.\n\nOne of the most indebted generations in American history is also the least equipped to manage its debt. Only 24 percent of Millenials qualify as financially literate, according to PWC and half expect that they wouldn't be able to handle an emergency bill of $2,000.\n\nFew colleges and fewer high schools teach pocketbook economics. No wonder we're slaves to the system.\n\n5. The government puts up roadblocks to starting our own businesses.\n\nDespite the majority of Millennials and college students indicating that they want to start their own business at some point, the number of actual entrepreneurs is going down. The share of new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 and 34 declined by 12% when compared to the same demographic in 1996.\n\nAccording to the Manhattan Institute, one of the biggest barriers to new business creation among those under 30 is the mountain of federal, state and local regulations.\n\nWithout modernizing government regulations to encourage new startups, we're likely to see entrepreneurship continue to decline. We'll also have less chances of making money driving an Uber or renting out a room on Airbnb, as the taxi and hotel industries and regulators crack down on innovation.\n\n6. Not only does government stop us from working, it takes what little cash we may have.\n\nPoliticians use Millennials to pay for programs such as Social Security and Medicare that would otherwise be insolvent. The amount of debt held by the public will be more that 79 percent of GDP by 2024, when Millennials will make up most of the labor force. To pay for that debt, taxes will have to rise.\n\nThe think tank Demos calls this generational theft.\n\n7. Of course, in the end, politicians don't care about us. We're, um, fkd.\n\nA survey from GenFKD confirms our suspicions: Presidential candidates don't discuss the issues important to America's largest eligible voting demographic, millennials.\n\nWhen asked whether or not the presidential candidates were addressing the issues close to them, roughly 86 percent, all aged 18 to 34, reported feeling ignored.\n\nWhat now?\n\nIf Grandma and Grandpa wonder why today's kids are angry, they may need to look at the economic policies that have us trapped. Today's political candidates need to:\n\nLay out realistic and viable plans to boost job growth;\n\nOverhaul last century's regulations,\n\nStop ripping us off to pay for the generations that stand in front of us;\n\nLet us get on with our careers, our business ideas and our dreams\n\nOr maybe they want us to believe pigs can fly.\n\nJustin Dent is the co-founder and Policy and Director at GenFKD.

Newly-installed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is calling for 70% taxation on the wealthy as a way to pay for her Green New Deal, which proposes to use government to create new jobs by investing in renewable energy.\n\nIn an interview set to air Sunday on CBS News' 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez — who has begun referring to herself by the nickname, AOC — told Anderson Cooper that the Green New Deal would require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, including raising taxes to a marginal rate of 70%, as in the 1960s.\n\nAOC referred to the 70% rate on people at the tippy-tops as the rich merely paying their fair share of the tax burden.\n\nShe compared the Green New Deal to other radical policies like President Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt launching Social Security in the New Deal.\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, the Green New Deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by President Barack Obama's green jobs czar, Van Jones. It seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.\n\nTo that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. AOC herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the United States moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.\n\nIn comparison, California — the most ambitious state in green energy policy — has merely set itself a goal of 100% renewables by 2045, more than 25 years away.\n\nObama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company Solyndra, which failed after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and others held it up as a model.\n\nJoel B.

Branden River High School in Bradenton, Florida, could make bras officially mandatory for female students following a controversy surrounding one of their students who was forced to put Band-Aids over her nipples after showing up for class without a bra on under her shirt.\n\nIn an attempt to address the situation, the school said it would change its dress code next year to make bras mandatory for all female students, reported the Washington Times, who added that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stepped in this week to defend the choice of students who don't want to wear a bra, saying the school's threat to impose a mandatory bra policy for girls amount to sex discrimination.\n\nIn a statement, the ACLU declared, A school's dress code cannot make generalizations about what types of clothing or appearance are appropriate for a boy or a girl to wear to school. Unfortunately, we often see gender stereotypes and discrimination play a prolific role in the enforcement of school dress codes across the country.\n\nLast month, 17-year-old Lizzy Martinez recounted her experience with the school.\n\nShe told me that I needed to put a shirt on under my long-sleeve shirt to try to tighten my breasts — to constrict them, claimed Martinez. And then she asked me to move around.\n\nMartinez was then sent to the school nurse, who gave her four Band-Aids to put over her nipples, which reportedly caused Martinez to break down in tears and leave school early.\n\nAccording to the Bradenton Herald, Martinez is organizing a bracott against the school.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Corporations should be encouraged to support gay rights as a means to further economic gain, attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos will hear this week.\n\nWorld leaders gather this week at the Swiss ski resort to discuss how to make globalism more inclusive in response to the rising tide of populism.\n\nAs part of that agenda Chief Operating Officer of the Thomson Reuters Foundation Antonio Zappulla has suggested private and public sector leaders be encouraged to be more inclusive of LGBT staff.\n\nSingling out organisations who have been leading on that agenda for praise, Zappulla cited the British intelligence agency, MI5, as an example of the progress made over the last decade.\n\nMI5, the UK's national counter-intelligence agency, currently ranks as Stonewall's top employer of the year: a remarkable achievement when you think that until the early 90s, LGBT people were altogether banned from working at the British intelligence services, he wrote.\n\nStarbucks, too, was also lauded as a company in touch with current LGBT culture, as evidenced by its advert featuring drag queens Bianca del Rio and Adore Delano, while Starbucks's CEO Howard Schultz gained applause from Zappulla for famously [putting] his money where his mouth is by telling a shareholder who opposed the company's vocal support for gay marriage to invest elsewhere.\n\nExamples such as these are good P.R., but they're also good for an organisation's bottom line, Zappulla argues.\n\nA report by Out Now estimates the US economy could add an extra $9 billion a year if companies improved their ability to retain LGBT talent through the implementation of inclusive policies. Countries where such policies do not exist are missing out: the World Bank estimates India is losing $32 billion a year in economic output precisely because of widespread discrimination against LGBT people.\n\nThe numbers are clear: there is an economic case for LGBT inclusion, and it's strong, he insists.\n\nCompanies with strong LGBT policies tend to innovate the most, to have loyal employees, and to experience significantly less [sic] cases of discrimination lawsuits. In addition to that, they are also positively perceived by their customers. It's a win-win.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that furthering LGBT interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge. His answer is to think and act 'glocally': underscoring the business benefits of diversity locally, and adopting global policies that make the workplace safe, fair and accepting for all.\n\nZappulla's agenda contribution comes as the World Economic Forum releases its Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2017, arguing that countries' economic development should not be judged on GDP alone, but on social participation.\n\nAccording to the authors, The report, which covers 109 economies, seeks to improve our understanding of how countries can use a diverse spectrum of policy incentives and institutional mechanisms to make economic growth more socially inclusive without dampening incentives to work, save and invest.\n\nAfter ranking the countries based on twelve key performance indicators of inclusive development including poverty, two inequality measures, and carbon intensity, Norway came out at the top of the list, followed by Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe United Kingdom was ranked 21st, while the United States was in 23rd place.\n\nThe authors hope to inspire a coordinated international initiative to raise median living standards, in part through the replacement of free trade deals with the facilitation of trade by encouraging convergence around best practices and standards to reduce frictions and boost development.
German government ministers have agreed on the outline of a new law, which, if passed, would make it easier to deport immigrants who break German laws.\n\nWe will tighten criminal law to make deportation easier, said Justice Minister Heiko Maas.\n\nThe new proposal would lower that threshold to pursue deportation such that any immigrant convicted of a crime with a jail sentence longer than one year would be eligible. In addition, specific crimes which will be looked at as cause for deportation include sexual assault, threatening someone's life, or attacking a police officer. Currently, these crimes usually result in probation and thus, do not result in deportation.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel, who has been under pressure since news of the assaults in Cologne broke last week, said of the proposal, We must make sure the law can take effect as soon as possible. Merkel supported an open border policy that led to over one million new immigrants entering the county, primarily from northern Africa and the Middle East.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, as many as 1,000 drunk men, identified by victims and police as mostly immigrants, filled the plaza outside the train station in Cologne and sexually assaulted passing women. A total of 553 police reports have been filed with law enforcement in Cologne, Germany, based on incidents that took place on New Year's Eve. The BBC reports 45% of those–about 250 reports–allege sexual assault on women.\n\nDespite the complete breakdown in public order, the police report published January 1 claimed the previous night had been relaxed and peaceful. It was only a week later that word of what had really happened began to make its way into newspapers.\n\nA leaked police report described the scene as chaos, with police completely unable to restore order or protect women being attacked. One direct result of the fiasco came last week; Cologne's police chief was ordered to take an early retirement.
In recent weeks, the Boy Scouts of America announced the organization would admit girls to take part in its programs. And now, Charisma News reports that condoms will be made available for its 2019 World Scout Jamboree in West Virginia and alcohol permitted in some areas.\n\nCharisma News reported:\n\nThe guidelines require that host organizations, who in this case include the former Boy Scouts of America (now Scouts BSA), … ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and IST [staff] at a number of locations on the site. Heads of Contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their Participants, Unit Leaders, Contingent Staff, and IST in an appropriate way. (See Guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) Stunningly, the World Jamboree Guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event. (It appears the Jamboree guidelines were drafted after the 2015 World Jamboree in Japan in preparation for the 2019 event and were just recently released in an email.)\n\nThe theme for next summer's Jamboree is Unlock a New World and will celebrate cultural exchange, mutual understanding, peace, and friendship, Charisma News reported.\n\nThe Scouts have defended their recent decision to admit girls, citing inclusivity.\n\nThe program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted Eagle Scout award, the Associated Press (AP) reported.\n\nThe New World Market is the only source for your official 24th World #ScoutJamboree merchandise and swag! Today, we're… Posted by 24th World Scout Jamboree – North America 2019 on Friday, April 20, 2018\n\nAP has reported that the Boy Scouts have been for boys and young men only for more than 100 years.\n\nBut in early May, a new name was announced to reflect the decision to admit girls: Scouts BSA. The change will become effective in February 2019.\n\nChief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh said many possibilities were considered during lengthy and 'incredibly fun' deliberations before the new name was chosen, AP reported.\n\nWe wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward, Surbaugh said. We're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and young women.\n\nThe parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts — its program for 7- to 10-year-olds — will keep its title, as well, AP reported. But the Boy Scouts — the program for 11- to 17-year-olds — will now be Scouts BSA.\n\nThe Girls Scouts issued a statement about the Boy Scouts' decision to admit girls by touting what makes its organization uniquely suited for girls.\n\nGirl Scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, Sylvia Acevedo, CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA, said in the statement. We are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills, explore STEM and the outdoors, participate in community projects, and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults.\n\nWe're also dedicated to building that critical STEM workforce pipeline that businesses and communities across the country are looking for, Acevedo said. Girls are our country's great untapped resource and are the key to our nation's competitive advantage in the new digital economy we're living in.\n\nThey'll be the drivers and the designers of our industries of the future, filling and creating jobs that don't even exist yet, Acevedo said. And at Girl Scouts, we're preparing them for these opportunities.\n\nThe 24th World Scout Jamboree will be held July 22 to August 2, 2019.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.
President Trump is seeking to halt the flow of birth tourism, the practice of foreign visitors arriving in the United States only to secure their U.S.-born children birthright American citizenship, by issuing a new regulation for State Department officials.\n\nEvery year, as Breitbart News reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 U.S.-born children, commonly referred to as anchor babies, who secure birthright American citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. Previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000.\n\nA new rule issued by the Trump administration states that consular officers who grant B-1 and B-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, must deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on U.S. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship.\n\nThe Department does not believe that visiting the United States for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the United States — an activity commonly referred to as 'birth tourism' — is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, for purposes of consular officers adjudicating applications for B nonimmigrant visas, the State Department regulation states.\n\nAn official with the White House said the rule is not only to enhance national security, but also to protect American taxpayers from being forced to subsidize the medical costs of foreign nationals solely trying to secure American citizenship for their U.S.-born children:\n\nThe birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in Federal prosecutions. Closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the United States from the national security risks created by this practice. It will also defend American taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe rule will codify in federal statute a requirement that B visa-holders prove they can pay the full costs associated with any medical treatment they are seeking in the U.S. As opposed to current policy, consular officers will be ordered to presume that a pregnant national seeking a B visa is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child.\n\nThe integrity of American citizenship must be protected, a White House official said.\n\nState Department officials have said foreign nationals seeking B visas are increasingly stating during the application process that they are traveling to the U.S. to give birth to their children.\n\nThe majority of beneficiaries of birth tourism arrive in the U.S. from China and Russia, two nations that are not Visa Waiver countries, meaning their nationals do not have instant temporary access to come to the U.S.\n\nA White House official told Breitbart News that nationals arriving from the 39 Visa Waiver countries, including South Korea, Singapore, Poland, and Taiwan, are not subject to this new rule.\n\nTo date, the U.S. Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled that the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic American citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.\n\nMany leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th Amendment was ratified.\n\nFor almost two years, Trump has signaled that he has reviewed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, otherwise known as the anchor baby policy. That executive order, though, has yet to come up for consideration.\n\nToday, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the U.S. under 18, exceeding the annual roughly four million American babies born every year and costing American taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The House Committee on Science Space and Technology released a report on Thursday detailing how Russia has been using social media platforms to disrupt domestic energy markets and influence domestic energy policies.\n\nThe 21-page report includes Russian posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, some with photographs and slogans.\n\nThe committee began investigating Russian attempts to influence U.S. energy markets in the summer of 2017 when Chairman [Lamar] Smith wrote [to] the Secretary of Treasury regarding Russia's intricate money-laundering scheme. Russian-sponsored agents funneled money to U.S. environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets, the report states.\n\nUpon discovering that Russia may have exploited American social media platforms to accomplish its disruptive objectives, the committee broadened the scope of its investigation, the report outlines. On September 26, 2017, the Committee requested data from Facebook and Twitter as part of this expanded investigation.\n\nThe documents social media companies provided to the committee confirm Russia's influence peddling, according to the report.\n\nThe report also includes an article posted on the Buzzfeed News website that revealed how the Russians used Instagram to influence Native Americans on oil and gas pipelines, including the Dakota Access Pipeline, the site of Native American protests.\n\nSmith requested more information about Russian actvity from social media companies last October, according to the report.\n\nThe committee received and reviewed the companies' produced documents for evidence of Russian influence, the report states. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were able to identify Russian accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company based in Saint Petersburg established by the Russian government for the purpose of deceptively using various social and traditional media platforms to advance Russian propaganda.\n\nThe information received from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram shows that Russian agents indeed sought to disrupt U.S. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy by exploiting American social media platforms, the report states.\n\nSome of the key findings of the report include:\n\n• Between 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 9,097 Russian posts or tweets regarding U.S. energy policy or a current energy event on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 4,334 IRA accounts across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nAccording to information provided by Twitter, more than four percent of all IRA tweets were related to energy or environmental issues, a significant portion of content when compared to the eight percent of IRA tweets that were related to the election in the U.S.\n\nThe IRA targeted pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy in the U.S.\n\nThe report also reveals that Russia wants to disrupt the cutting edge technology that has resulted in an American domestic energy renaissance, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\n\nHorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as a means for producing oil and natural gas began in the early 2000s, the report states. At that time, there were approximately 26,000 hydraulically fractured wells in the United States, which accounted for 'less than 7%' of all U.S. marketed natural gas. By 2011, fracking had become the primary method for oil and natural gas development in the United States.\n\nSince 2014, fracked wells have 'accounted for most of all new wells drilled and completed,' the report states. The number of fracked wells had climbed 'to an estimated 300,000' by 2015, and were responsible for approximately 67 percent of all U.S. natural gas output.\n\nIn January 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that contained clear evidence that the Kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the United States, the report states.\n\nThe report also highlights how U.S. energy exports reaching the global marketplace is a threat to Russia's dominance in some of those markets. For example, according to the report, Poland recently signed a five-year agreement with the United States to import liquefied natural gas into the country in an attempt to decrease dependency on Russian energy supplies.\n\nClimate change is also an issue the Russians are exploiting on social media, according to the report.\n\nNumerous Russian posts focused on the ongoing debate about climate change by linking catastrophic weather events to climate change and divisively labeling one viewpoint as right and one as left, the report states. One post characterizes Americans as ignoring major events that are allegedly signs of climate change. Additionally, these posts frame the conservative viewpoint regarding climate change as a 'liberal hoax, all in an effort to generate further domestic controversy surrounding the issue of climate change.\n\nThe report concludes:\n\nThe Committee will continue its ongoing efforts to identify foreign interference in domestic energy policy, whether from Russia or any other country so that the American people can formulate their positions based on facts rather than foreign propaganda.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Thursday that French President Emmanuel Macron is the champion of Europe's pro-immigration forces and therefore he has a duty to oppose him.\n\nThere is no denying that Emmanuel Macron is an important figure, in fact, the leader of the pro-immigration forces, Mr. Orbán told a press conference in Budapest.\n\nResponding to a question from Le Monde, the prime minister said that he has good relations with Macron, but when it comes to views of migration, the two are on opposite sides.\n\nIt is nothing personal, but a matter of our countries' futures, Orbán noted.\n\nIf what he wants with regards to migration takes place in Europe, that would be bad for Hungary, therefore I must fight him, he said.\n\nMr. Orbán said he hopes that parties committed to curbing illegal immigration will win a majority in the European Parliament elections next May, in order to modify the current policy of the EU executive.\n\nHe also denounced the policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the attitude of the German media, which are constantly pushing for Europe to welcome more and more migrants, in opposition to the will of the Hungarian people.\n\nOn that, there is no compromise possible, he insisted. German politics does not respect the Hungarians' decision not to become an immigrant nation.\n\nThe prime minister also welcomed the initiative of Poland and Italy to form an alliance for the next European elections, to fight for the renaissance of European values ​​against the immigrationist schemes of the globalists.\n\nThe Italian-Polish alliance, the Warsaw-Rome alliance is one of the biggest events that could mark this beginning of the year, Mr. Orbán said, while holding up Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini as a hero who managed to stop the influx of migrants in Italy.\n\nMr. Salvini met Wednesday with his Polish counterpart Joachim Brudzinski to discuss migration policies and European Union (EU) border security.\n\nThe Europe that will be formed in June will guide us all, unlike the one that exists today and is led by bureaucrats, Salvini said during his visit to Warsaw.\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Orbán has called out Mr. Macron as a key player in Europe's pro-immigration forces.\n\nLast August, Mr. Orbán and Mr. Salvini labeled the globalist French president the leader of pro-migration parties in Europe today at a joint press conference in Milan, Italy.\n\nThe two pro-sovereignty politicians singled out Macron as their political enemy, announcing that they would form an anti-mass migration coalition ahead of European Parliament elections to challenge his vision for the European Union.\n\nHe leads the European force that backs migration, he's the leader of those parties who back migration to Europe, and on the other side there's us who want to stop illegal migration, Orbán said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Macron welcomed the title, announcing that he is the chief adversary of the European populist bloc spearheaded by Matteo Salvini and Viktor Orbán.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Thursday on The Hugh Hewitt Show, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said it is likely if President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to build a border wall it would be overturned in the courts.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nJOHNSON: Well, first of all, I think the President will. He's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. And from my standpoint, I think one of the things Republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. You know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. We should be preparing, and I'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that I'm a co-sponsor of to fund the Coast Guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. Hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. Hopefully, Mitch McConnell will bring it up on the floor of the Senate. I don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because Democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. And of course, Nancy Pelosi was very clear in the White House yesterday that when President Trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? You know, will I get my barrier funding? And she said no. And so again, the Democrats are being hypocritical. They're paying lip service to border security. Barriers actually work. They absolutely do. We need them. It's kind of a first step table stakes issue. But they're playing politics. And I hope the President stands strong.\n\nHEWITT: Should the President invoke a national emergency declaration even though there are good arguments on both sides whether or not that is Constitutional?\n\nJOHNSON: Yeah, you know, I hope he doesn't. I think that does open up a Pandora's Box. I think we'd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. You know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don't fund it. And I think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on Democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.\n\nHEWITT: But the consequences are spreading. I know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because FEMA can't issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. And so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. I'm not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an Article I guy, you're not going to like the idea that Article II can act unilaterally.\n\nJOHNSON: No, I don't think any of us should. And let's face it, I think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. I mean, they're going to take it up to the 9th Circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won't get the barrier. So I want the barrier. I want a secure border. And I think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the President was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. You know, I'm all for doing that. I'm happy to hang with him. There will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. I mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. There's no doubt about it. So let's address that specifically. Don't completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with Plan B as Democrats, as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer continue to dig in, let's give them basically an offer that they simply can't refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.\n\nHEWITT: But that ends up, again, leaving if not 800,000 people out of a paycheck, 400,000 people without a paycheck and the consequences of a shutdown, whereas a national emergency declaration allows you to reopen the government and moves the question of the president's power concerning the border squarely, and Jonathan Turley has written a great piece on this in the Hill. I know you're an Article I guy. But I'm not sure, it goes to the 9th Circuit, they'll lose in the 9th Circuit. It would go up to the Supreme Court. Are you sure it would lose at the Supreme Court, Senator Johnson?\n\nJOHNSON: No, I have no idea. I'm not a lawyer. But let's face it. The administration hasn't been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. It's going to be based on their policy preference. So let's face it. Our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.\n\nHEWITT: Now, but do you believe if it got to the Supreme Court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?\n\nJOHNSON: I really don't know.\n\nHEWITT: I don't think anyone does. That's the right answer. I don't think anyone does. So given that it's an open question, and I know Jonathan Turley thinks it's an open question, you'll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it's a closed question. It's not. Nobody knows what they would do. The key case here is Youngstown Sheet and Tube. Given that that is an open question, isn't that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? Or do you think yours is the preferred solution?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, again, I want to maintain pressure, because I actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. You know, Hugh, we do have a crisis. You know, it drives me crazy how Democrats are minimizing this problem. You know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? Everybody recognized it. The Obama administration responded to it. The CBP was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. About 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. Last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. In the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. You know, we have the Flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. And once they get here, they are home free. And when I hear Democrats talk about technology on the border, I mean, that's fine. We can track somebody, we can apprehend them. We process them. And then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. That's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally And Hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, I think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted. I've seen the pictures of a dead, desiccated animal-chewed bodies in the desert because we incentivize people to try and come to this country illegally. There's nothing humane about that. That is the crisis.
California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed his first budget for the state on Friday, and it includes a tax on drinking water.\n\nThe budget, titled California for All, declares drinking water a fundamental right, and adds: The Budget includes short-term measures to bring immediate relief to communities without safe drinking water and also proposes an ongoing sustainable funding source to address this problem into the future.\n\nThat source is a new fund, the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund:\n\nSafe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund—Establish a new special fund, with a dedicated funding source from new water, fertilizer, and dairy fees, to enable the State Water Resources Control Board to assist communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, in paying for the short-term and long-term costs of obtaining access to safe and affordable drinking water. This proposal is consistent with the policy framework of SB 623, introduced in the 2017-18 legislative session. The Budget also includes $4.9 million General Fund on a one-time basis for the State Water Resources Control Board and the Department of Food and Agriculture to take initial steps toward implementation of this new Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Program, including (1) implementation of fee collection systems, (2) adoption of an annual implementation plan, and (3) development of a map of high-risk aquifers used as drinking water sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle notes: The details of the proposed tax are unknown, but a similar proposal was abandoned by then-Governor Jerry Brown last year after failing to garner enough support in the legislature.\n\nCritics have already slammed the plan, with former Republican gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen urging fellow Republicans to take back the state, and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association and the Association of California Water Agencies saying the state should tap into its budget surplus to pay for the needed clear water supplies.\n\nJoel B.

Senator Lindsey Graham led a group of Republican Senators warning that they would oppose a swift passage of the economic rescue package unless changes are made to its unemployment benefits section.\n\nThat prompted Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to say he too would hold up the bill over his objections to the aid to U.S. businesses.\n\nUnless Republican Senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund, Senator Sanders tweeted.\n\nGraham's last-minute objections to the deal agreed to by the White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democrat leader Chuck Schumer sent shudders through financial markets. Stocks lost about half their gains for the day as it became apparent that the deal was not as sure to pass as it had seemed.\n\nGraham said in a statement issued with Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican, and Senator Ben Sasse, the Nebraska Republican, that there was a massive drafting error in the economic stimulus bill.\n\nUnless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work, the senators said. We must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the Department of Labor issues regulatory guidance that no American would earn more by not working than by working.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances, unemployment benefits are designed to pay workers less than they would earn by working, creating an incentive to seek and accept work. The economic rescue package under consideration by Senate provides for bolstered benefits that could, in some circumstances, pay some workers more than they had earned while employed.\n\nThis bill pays you more not to work than if you were working, Graham said during a press conference Wednesday. If this is not a drafting error, then this is the worst idea that I've seen in a long time.\n\nProponents of the more generous benefits say that in the current situation, where many businesses have been closed by anti-pandemic efforts and workers are being urged to stay home, this objection is meritless. When people are told not to work for the sake of public health, disincentivizing work is not a serious problem.\n\nSenator Rick Scott, the Florida Republican, joined the other three senators at a press conference on the issue Wednesday.\n\nOnce we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn't have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce,  the Florida Senator tweeted.\n\nGraham's comments suggest he did not understand that millions of American workers are being shut out of their workplaces by government policy, minimizing the cost created by alleged incentives not to work. What's more, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits.\n\nSanders' responded by raising his own objections to the bill. It's likely that if Graham and his fellow Republicans open up parts of the bill to renegotiation, Democrats will also demand changes.\n\nUnless Republican Senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund. pic.twitter.com/7X0o9C4BoO — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) March 25, 2020\n\nThat could result in delays to the rescue package that could make the economic damage from the pandemic much more severe.
The lack of taxpayer payments to Central American economic migrants is a crisis on the border, says California Democrat Scott Peters, who presented the party's weekend message.\n\nIt's a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations, he said in the carefully drafted January 11 speech.\n\nPeters did not say how much financial aid and healthcare must be given by U.S. taxpayers to the economic migrants as they head for U.S. jobs, communities, and schools.\n\nOverall, the speech tried to blame President Donald Trump for public alarm over the growing flood of economic migrants into U.S. job markets and neighborhoods. Peters said:\n\nThere is a humanitarian crisis created by him. It's a crisis when the President threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick. It a crisis when the President spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in November, as a political stunt to rally the base. It's a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.\n\nIn reality, migrants bring their children because multiple Democrat-backed loopholes in U.S asylum law allow them to walk through the border walls and into U.S jobs, welfare programs, schools, and communities.\n\nThe Democrats' speech tried to reassure voters that Democrats are not pushing for a policy of open borders, even though nearly all Democratic legislators oppose any policies which might reduce the flow of migrants. Nearly all Democrats also oppose the deportation of economic migrants, even after judges say they do not meet U.S. legal requirements for asylum.\n\nPeters said:\n\nWhen President Trump says Democrats are against border security and for open borders, he's lying. We do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. No. That's not border security. That's borderline crazy.\n\nInstead of a border wall – like the triple-layered wall which effectively protects his district from migration out of Mexico — Peters touted the Democrats' promise of a virtual wall of technology and sensors. Legislators know the virtual wall does not stop migrants — but it does shield some pro-migration politicians from worried voters.\n\nPeters pushed that claim while touting a draft bill that would require the border agencies to postpone action until they have studied the migration problem they have studied and grappled with for decades:\n\nIn the last Congress, my colleagues Pete Aguilar of California, a Democrat, and Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. It would have directed Homeland Security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer Congress a strategy for each section of the border. It might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in San Diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. It might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. It might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. Or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. But if Homeland Security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.\n\nNancy Pelosi is pushing the no-wall 'technology wall' alternative to Trump's actual wall. The PR scam worked for biz under Bush/Obama – until the public picked Trump to build a real wall. But it now might help provide PR cover for Democrats to compromise. https://t.co/HqX024EcTY — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2019\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
This year's Oscar broadcast could be a lot less boring as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Monday that acceptance speeches can no longer contain the endless lists of thank yous that have become a staple at the awards ceremony.\n\nAt the annual Oscar nominee luncheon in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Academy announced that for the first time, all nominees would submit written lists of those they wish to thank that will then be displayed on screens at the Dolby Theatre and on viewers' screens at home.\n\nAs you probably are aware, and we don't want to embarrass anybody, but there is a long list of winners who have totally forgotten their directors, their husbands, their wives, their children and their animals, producer David Hill said, according to the Independent. It's a permanent record which could be kept, even framed and kept in the family forever. How cool is that?!\n\nAcceptance speeches were capped at 45 seconds beginning in 2010. The new move allows the Academy to skip past what is traditionally the most boring part of any Oscars ceremony, and nominees will be under less pressure to remember every single producer or associate they ever worked with.\n\nWhile the new policy will help cut down on famously long speeches like those from Dallas Buyers Club winner Matthew McConaughey and Monster's Ball's Halle Berry, it could also deprive viewers of some of the most memorable Oscars moments ever, like Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s acceptance speech at the 1997 Oscars:\n\nJoe Pesci, however, is unlikely to be affected.
The Times of Israel reports: UNITED NATIONS — The United States absolutely supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but is thinking of new ways to push for a peace deal, US Ambassador Nikki Haley (pictured) said Thursday.\n\nIt would be an error to say the United States is abandoning its decades-old policy of backing a Palestinian state as part of a final settlement, she told reporters.\n\nWe absolutely support a two-state solution, but we are thinking out-of-the-box as well, Haley said following a Security Council meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRead more here.
Lawmakers in North Dakota are taking up legislation that would allow competing in sports in high school and college based on one's biological sex.\n\nIf it becomes law it would mean that girls or boys could not participate in sports based on their preferred gender, they would have to compete based on their actual sex.\n\nThe Grand Forks Herald reported on the bill:\n\nHouse Bill 1298 would prevent publicly funded institutions, like high schools and universities, from allowing any individual who was assigned the opposite sex at birth to participate on an athletic team that is designed exclusively for females or exclusively for males. Additionally, the bill would outlaw any state-owned athletic facility from hosting a competition in which an athlete competes against anyone outside of the gender they were assigned at birth. But while LGBTQ advocates argued the bill would have far-reaching implications for transgender people in North Dakota, its lead sponsor, Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the legislation has nothing to do with transgender athletes. Instead, Koppelman said he is pursuing changes to the law out of a concern for fairness in sports and to prevent women from being disadvantaged by having to compete against men. While transgender athletes are not explicitly noted in Koppelman's bill, critics argued that it clearly targets the transgender community. House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, said he couldn't think of any other reason that this bill would be introduced.\n\nI kind of dismiss the idea that it should be about trans, because it's not about trans — it's about fair competition, Koppelman said. What it's based on is science that says, 'Here are the physiological differences between people when they are born.' And these are irreversible things.\n\nI don't know the problem that's trying to be solved, Koppelman said.\n\nRight now under a North Dakota High School Activities Association 2015 statute transgender students taking hormonal supplements can compete in sports under their gender identity on a case by case basis.\n\nUnder this policy, a student who has transitioned from female to male may compete in boys sports but is no longer eligible to compete in girls sports, the Tribune reported. A student who has transitioned from male to female may continue to compete in boys sports and is eligible to compete in girls sports after completing one year of testosterone suppression.\n\nThe Tribune interviewed opponents to the legislation, including Libby Skarin, a regional campaign director with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who said the bill is an attack on transgender North Dakotans.\n\nEither don't compete at all, or compete in a sport that doesn't match their gender identity, Skarin said.\n\nSen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, is a co-sponsor on the bill and said it was about women's rights and disagrees.\n\nI would never want my daughter to play in sports and have a guy beat her out in track or out in javelin, where she has no chance, Myrdal said.\n\nUnlike a transgender athlete bill defeated in the South Dakota Legislature in 2019, Koppelman's bill also applies to collegiate athletics, a difference that Skarin said could put North Dakota out of step with national governing bodies like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Tribune reported.\n\nThe NCAA supports athletes competing according to their perceived gender rather than their biological sex.\n\nMydral said in the report that students have to make choices, including whether they want to pursue athletics.\n\nPeople will scream and holler and say, 'Oh, you denied them being in sports,' she said. Yeah, maybe we do. So maybe by making that choice to try to change your gender, you lose some opportunities. But you're not going to take all women and girls' opportunities away just because you wish to do that.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
The United Kingdom has shrugged off concerns of handing China a back-door key to the nation's critical national infrastructure and spiking post-Brexit trade with key Anglosphere allies, signing off the involvement of Huawei in the future 5G data networks.\n\nTech giant Huawei, a company critics claim is controlled by the Chinese government and uses its advanced, cheap, and pervasive equipment to commit espionage on foreign powers — claims the company strongly denies — will have a so-called limited role in the rollout of next-generation 5G technology, the British government has decided.\n\nDelingpole: Huawei, Coronavirus and Boris's Great Brexit Betrayal https://t.co/xDFShRd9cj — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2020\n\nThe move was decided Tuesday by the UK National Security Council, a group of senior cabinet ministers chaired by the Prime Minister and attended by civil servants and military bosses, following advice from the Civil Service, which decided in spite of the many warnings and potential pitfalls presented by the Huawei deal to rubber-stamp the deal last week.\n\nUnder the decision, Huawei will not be permitted to supply equipment to sensitive parts of the network core, but will provide a third of the equipment to what the BBC reports to be the periphery of Britain's future 5G network. The report states the permitted equipment will include masts, clearly implying the radio backbone of the network itself which will handle consumer and business data will use Huawei technology.\n\nThe distinction between the core and the periphery has been enough for the government to overlook security warnings from both senior intelligence figures as home, and key allies abroad. But the United States, for instance, which has been absolutely clear in its calls for Huawei to be totally excluded, believes the distinction now will not protect the network from potential espionage and sabotage in future.\n\nWhat is less clear, is why the British government has so willingly entered into a relationship with Huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on Brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the European Union. Australia and New Zealand have warned the UK against imperilling the Five-Eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting Huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the United States has explicitly said Huawei involvement would imperil a post-Brexit trade deal.\n\nU.S. Warns Britain Accepting Huawei 5G Will Imperil Post-Brexit Trade Deal https://t.co/RIK3ojyXhK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 25, 2020\n\nThis is of particular importance because signing a trade deal with the United States quickly after Brexit appears to be a key lynchpin of the post-EU strategy, as an easy passage of that agreement would be a major signal to the rest of the world that the UK is emerging ready to trade, and easy to do business with. It also holds the European Union's feet to the fire, as their anticipated prevarication over signing a deal with the UK would be shown up as a sham in the light of a quick deal with the U.S.\n\nYet, the BBC reports, China seems to have given the United Kingdom a simple choice — choose Huawei or face substantial repercussions to trade and investment. Given the choice between the U.S. and China, Prime Minister Johnson appears to have chosen Beijing.\n\nGiven this disconnect in stated policy and public action, some may view the advice of unelected civil servants to the National Security Council to ignore security and trade concerns and sign with Huawei anyway with concern.\n\nResponding Tuesday, a White House spokesman said the Trump administration was disappointed with the decision, while Conservative statesman and former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said the decision beggars belief.\n\nKlon Kitchen of the Heritage Foundation said of China's previous bad-faith behaviour on leveraging their tech equipment installed in foreign nations: China has already shown it's perfectly willing and able to exploit others in this way, having siphoned data from the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, over networks its state-owned companies constructed earlier this decade. Recent history and common sense are united: it would be utterly foolish for Britain to give China similar access.\n\nJames Delingpole writes of this in Breitbart London:\n\nThe Huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything Boris Johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. It's also a betrayal of the very thing on which Boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful Brexit. One of the key elements in Boris's vision of a bright, post-Brexit future for Britain outside the European Union is international trade: all those incredible deals Britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by EU regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by President Trump with the U.S. But Trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if Britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the Huawei deal. If you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service — led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill — is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris's post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely. You would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. We have scotched the Remainer snake but we have not killed it. No doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.\n\nRead More
Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, was sworn in on January 1. He won a landslide election in October on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-United States, and pro-Israel. At the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-Cuba, and anti-Venezuela.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. For instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words Ordem e Progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: The national motto is order and progress. No society can develop without respecting these:\n\nA recent poll showed his approval rating to be 75 percent.\n\nYet at the same time, Bolsonaro has plenty of enemies, especially in the international media. Although he embraces the label Tropical Trump, the media escalate from there; it's common to see him characterized as a neo-fascist, or just a plain old fascist.\n\nYet Brazilians will likely judge Bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. The country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.\n\nBy territory, Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. It's been estimated, in fact, that Brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. That's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every Brazilian man, woman, and child.\n\nIt is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. That is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. We might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. Such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.\n\nYet if fairly dividing the pie is important, strongly expanding the pie is even more important. There's wealth in Brazil, but not nearly enough of it—at least not now.\n\nAnd part of that problem is that Brazil is remarkably undeveloped. If we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the Atlantic Ocean. We might compare this situation to that of the U.S.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across North America, to Texas, California—and everywhere else west of the Atlantic seaboard.\n\nSo why haven't Brazilians gone west, as we did? Part of the answer is that the territory is mostly Amazonian rain forest, and as such, for most of Brazil's history, it has been inhospitable to settlement, let alone development.\n\nYet by the time that new technologies to foster development in Amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.\n\nThe new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. Some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. And some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; Amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of Greens around the world.\n\nAs a result, much of Brazil's land became off-limits to development. Today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of Brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. To put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average Brazilian. Admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. And yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all Brazilians.\n\nCombined with other environmental restrictions on land use, Amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. And, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.\n\nIndeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. Where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. And Brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.\n\nWe can say that Brazil today is a bit like what the U.S. would be like if the land west of the Appalachian Mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (In fact, the U.S. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)\n\nMoreover, as we all know, in recent years there's been a sudden surge of attempted restrictions on economic activity in every country in the world—namely, international mandates to clamp down on carbon dioxide, all aimed at doing something about climate change.\n\nThe average Brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible. Indeed, Brazil is rated as having the highest crime rate in the world, and street crime is terrifyingly rampant.\n\nYet still, before Bolsonaro, leftist Brazilian governments had meekly accepted the Western Green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. Such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.\n\nThen came Bolsonaro. His campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Framework, and he has named Ernesto Araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. Araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in October, The tactic of the Left essentially consists of the following: To sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:\n\nSo we can see that in his fierce antagonism toward foreign hegemonists, Araújo almost sounds like a leftist himself. And yet he's not: he's simply a Brazilian nationalist, tired of other countries imposing their will on his country.\n\nIn December, Bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: Environmental politics can't muddle with Brazil's development. Today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.\n\nYet in addition, Brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.\n\nAs Bloomberg News has reported, Bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. One of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. Because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. Brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual GDP totals barely more than $2 trillion. The metal is already being mined in Brazil, but Bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; Brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.\n\nAs an aside, we might note that rare-earth elements are a key strategic concern of the U.S., since they are vital to our military technology, as well as to our civilian tech. And yet today, the U.S. is 100 percent dependent on China for 29 minerals.\n\nIf such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. The Trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. And so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from Brazil.\n\nNeedless to say, the thought of digging up Amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to Western environmentalists. Yet for their part, Brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted Bolsonaro into office. As this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. Green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.\n\nGiven this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that Western Greens would be well advised to work with Brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. That is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. After all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.\n\nYet instead, it seems as though Western Greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with Bolsonaro. On December 27, the Sierra Club magazine headlined a story, What Will It Take to Rein in the Trump of Brazil? Brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. In that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that Ernesto Araújo was railing against—the Sierra Club declares, Bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.\n\nWe might pause over that word: contain. That is, the people of Brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. And yet now, the Sierra Club, and other Western Greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the Brazilian standard of living.\n\nWill Brazilian nationalists be pleased to discover that the Greens are actively using international financial levers against their country? And how will ordinary Brazilians respond to these threats to their standard of living? It will be interesting to see what happens in this looming standoff.\n\nLike Donald Trump in North America, Jair Bolsonaro in South America is an experiment. Both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. Both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including Green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:\n\nTrump has his track record, and Bolsonaro is starting his. Mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention.
Well-heeled customers of the New York Times paid more than $7000, not including airfare, to tour the country of Iran and even visit the home of the late Ayatollah Khomeini. This at a time when a Washington Post reporter had been in a brutal Tehran prison for more than two years.\n\nThe official tour guides of these trips included by-lined reporters and columnists of the Times, raising ethical questions and questions about the Times' often favorable coverage of the repressive regime. Lee Smith of The Tablet goes so far as to accuse the Times of buying the Iran concession.\n\nThe trips are a part of the New York Times' glitzy Times Journeys that typically sends wealthy readers to places like Austria and Great Britain.\n\nJames Kirchik, writing in Foreign Policy, said it is dismaying that the Times would collaborate in a business venture with a government currently imprisoning an American reporter.\n\nCalled Iran: Tales from Persia, the 13-day tour included on the ground experts who will help untangle this nation's complex timeline. Starting in Tehran, you will journey across the country, through beautiful landscapes, arid mountains and rural villages, learning about the traditions and cultures of a land who influence has been felt for thousands of years.\n\nThe business aspect of the arrangement would almost certainly have to be approved by the Iranian government, with the regime taking a cut of the New York Times action.\n\nSmith accuses the Times of going into this business arrangement to spare their own people the fate of Jason Rezaian [Washington Post reporters who was just released] while also ensuring that they would have plenty of access to the regime — or the people who speak to Western reporters, namely the moderates. He calls the arrangement a bribe.\n\nSmith calls this a new journalism model where the Times makes money not on getting new readers, but on selling travel to authoritarian regimes and gaining journalistic access in the bargain.\n\nWould the regime have struck a deal with the Times if the paper of record promised to send its toughest, hardest-hitting reporting — the kinds of tough guys like Burns or C.J. Chivers who would rather have their fingernails pulled out one by one by the torturers in Evin prison than pull their punches in print? he asks.\n\nRather, the Times uses name reporters like Roger Cohen, Elaine Sciolino, and John F. Burns, who moonlight as tour guides. Smith excoriates the Times' man in Tehran Thomas Erdbrink, who has consistently lauded current Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Smith says, selective ignorance seems to be Erdbrink's journalistic trademark.\n\nSmith accuses Erdbrink of going out of his way defend the Iranian president, such as the time Erdbrink reported that Rouhani went on CNN and condemned the Holocaust though it was pointed out Rouhani never used that word. Erdbrink also reported that Rouhani wished Israelis a Happy Rosh Hashanah though the Times later had to correct that.\n\nIt is unclear whether Jews or homosexuals are allowed on the New York Times tours to Iran.\n\nFollow Austin Ruse on Twitter @austinruse.
Democrat presidential candidates entered the ninth Democrat presidential primary debate on Wednesday in attack mode.\n\nThe candidates launched at least 50 different attacks in the debate that, at times, appeared to overwhelm the NBC debate moderators.\n\nThe candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in his first debate answer. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went further, reminding voters that Bloomberg called women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, comparing him to President Donald Trump.\n\nLook, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is, she said. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) attacked Bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.\n\nI'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.\n\nJoe Biden began the debate by challenging Bloomberg on New York City's policy of stop-and-frisk.\n\nHe didn't get a whole lot done, Biden said about Bloomberg. He had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\nPete Buttigieg began his remarks by warning Democrats that the Democrat race could end up between Bloomberg and Sanders.\n\nLet's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat, he said, alluding to Sanders' political identity as a Democratic socialist and Bloomberg's flip from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat.\n\nWe shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. We can do better.\n\nSanders then pivoted to Buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, prompting Buttigieg to accuse Sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the Culinary Union in Las Vegas.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar jumped in to attack Sanders' insurance bill, citing the millions of Americans who could lose their health care under his plan.\n\nWarren then attacked Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Sanders on their health care plans.\n\nButtigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar, she said, was like a Post-It note, that read, Insert Plan Here. And Sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.\n\nKlobuchar pivoted to a Las Vegas gambling attack on both Warren's and Sanders' plan for health care.\n\nWhy is Medicare for All not on the wheel? she asked. Why is it not on the wheel? Because two-thirds of the Democratic senators are not even on that bill.\n\nBiden then stepped in to warn that Sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked Bloomberg for calling Obamacare a disgrace.\n\nWhat am I, chicken liver? Bloomberg responded when Warren jumped in to attack Buttigieg's plan.\n\nAs the moderators turned the debate topic to Bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in New York, Biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.\n\nLet's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have.\n\nWarren attacked Bloomberg by accusing him of willful ignorance of the stop-and-frisk impact on communities of color.\n\nWhen the moderators questioned whether Sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that Bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.\n\nBut Buttigieg responded by attacking Sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking Sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.\n\nKlobuchar attacked Sanders for failing to release the records from his physical and called for Bloomberg to release his tax returns.\n\nAfter Bloomberg said he was working on it, Warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nSanders attacked Bloomberg by reminding Democrats that he supported former President George W. Bush for president in 2004 and donated to Republicans.\n\nBiden reminded voters that Bloomberg did not support Obama for president.\n\nAfter the moderators switched topics, Buttigieg then jumped to attack Klobuchar for failing to remember the name of the Mexican president.\n\nAre you trying to say that I'm dumb? Klobuchar replied. Or are you mocking me here, Pete?\n\nAs Klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the Senator of Minnesota, Buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate Walter Mondale, also from Minnesota.\n\nThe NBC debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on Nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.\n\nSanders hit Bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.\n\nBloomberg hit Sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.\n\nI was thinking there was going to be a boxing rematch on Saturday in Vegas, and those guys should go down there, Klobuchar replied, referring to an upcoming boxing fight in the state.\n\nSanders continued, attacking Bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted Bloomberg to call Sanders a communist.\n\nWe're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work.\n\nSanders continued to attack Bloomberg for his wealth until the former New York City mayor reminded him that the Vermont senator owns three houses.\n\nWhat a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.\n\nButtigieg then flattered Sanders by saying he was into Bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.\n\nWhen Warren got time, she attacked Biden and Klobuchar for being eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell and Buttigieg for taking money from big donors and changing his positions.\n\nButtigieg used his time to attack Bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while Sanders was trying to burn the house down.\n\nHe also criticized Klobuchar for voting to confirm Trump's nominee for Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAs Klobuchar and Buttigieg bickered back and forth, debate moderator Chuck Todd intervened.\n\nGuys, guys, we are at the end here. We are at the end here, he said. I've got to let that one go.
French President Emmanuel Macron has confirmed that he had spoken to U.S. President Donald J Trump and that members of the G7 will hold an emergency Leaders' Summit via videoconference on Monday to discuss coronavirus.\n\nMr Macron announced via Twitter on Friday: Following my call with Donald Trump and all G7 leaders, we agreed to organise an extraordinary Leaders' Summit by videoconference on Monday on COVID-19.\n\nWe will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatment, and work on an economic and financial response.\n\nFollowing my call with @realDonaldTrump and all G7 leaders, we agreed to organize an extraordinary Leaders Summit by videoconference on Monday on Covid-19. We will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) March 13, 2020\n\nThe G7, or Group of Seven, is comprised of the leaders of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan, and generally meets to discuss economic policy and address challenges affecting global economic growth.\n\nThe announcement was made two days after President Trump unveiled a travel ban on 26 European countries in the Schengen Zone visa-free travel area. A number of countries across Europe have recently enacted restrictions including shutting schools and limiting the internal movement of people. The Czech Republic has followed President Trump's lead and has enacted a travel ban of 13 countries considered to be high-risk nations.\n\nAlso on Friday, the World Health Organization's Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced: Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China. More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.\n\nPresident Trump has criticised the European Union's response to the pandemic, saying: The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots… As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.
Smartphones are capturing all of life's moments, and doctor visits are no exception.\n\nAt least 1 in 10 U.S. patients now records discussions at medical appointments, researchers said.\n\nBut do they have the right to do so?\n\nThe legality of these taped visits depends on where you live, said investigators from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.\n\nIn the U.S., the situation is complex, said professor and senior scientist Dr. Glyn Elwyn.\n\nWiretapping or eavesdropping statutes provide the primary legal framework guiding recording practices and protecting privacy, so a patient who would like to record a doctor's visit should familiarize themselves with laws in their state, Elwyn said.\n\nThere are two main differences between state wiretapping laws, Elwyn and his colleagues said in a new report.\n\nIn all-party states, recordings made by doctors or patients are illegal unless everyone involved is aware and provides consent.\n\nIn one-party states, just one person involved in a conversation needs to be aware and consent to the recording. Only in these states can patients legally record an office visit without their doctor's consent and vice versa.\n\nThe authors said 39 states and Washington, D.C., follow the one-party consent rule; all others adhere to the all-party requirement.\n\nHow are patients using these increasingly common recordings?\n\nAfter reviewing 33 studies involving audio-recorded clinical visits, the researchers found that about 7 out of 10 patients listened to their own recordings. A similar number shared them with a caregiver.\n\nIn many cases, patients used the tapes to remember important details about their office visits.\n\nMost people are sharing their recordings with a family member or caregiver, or they are listening to recording themselves, so they can better recall the information they received during the encounter, Elwyn said in an institute news release.\n\nPatients said the recordings left them feeling more satisfied with their care.\n\nHealth care overall is moving toward greater transparency and patient recordings are going to become more common, Elwyn said.\n\nThat means there would be tremendous benefit to patient advocacy groups, health care organizations, providers and policymakers working together to develop clear guidelines and policies around the responsible, positive use of open recordings, he added.\n\nWhile some doctors and hospitals worry that taped appointments and procedures will be used against them, others take a more positive view. The Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, for example, encourages patient-doctor recordings and rewards doctors who comply, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published July 10 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Climate change a key issue as voters head to polls on Super Tuesday Environmental policy is set to be a key issue as voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli joins CBSN to discuss why climate change matters more this year than ever before.
Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York, the incoming chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, pledged to conduct strong oversight of the White House when his party takes control of the House on Thursday, but said Democrats should wait and see before discussing impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nFor the last two years, the president has had no oversight, no accountability from Congress. The Republican Congress was completely derelict in its responsibility to provide oversight, Nadler said on CBS This Morning Wednesday. We're going to provide that oversight. We're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.\n\nNadler said that the Judiciary Committee will also hold hearings on the December deaths of two migrant children in Border Patrol custody. This is inhuman and it's not precedented, he said, referring to the White House's hardline immigration agenda. It's a deliberate creation of the Trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. And if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that.\n\nThe veteran New York lawmaker said House Democrats will use their investigative committee powers over the administration to probe the White House's controversial migrant family separation policy — which it was forced to rescind after a massive public uproar — as well as the appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has previously denounced special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections and alleged coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nStill, Nadler stressed that his committee, which has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, will only hold impeachment hearings against the president if certain criteria are met.\n\nImpeachment is designed as a defense of the republic against a president who would aggrandize power, destroy liberty, destroy Democratic institutions, destroy the separations of power, he said. If that happens, if you get real evidence of that, then you have to consider impeachment hearings.\n\nThere's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the Mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it, Nadler added.\n\nAsked about the partial government shutdown and impasse in budget negotiations between lawmakers and the White House over Mr. Trump's unwavering demand for $5 billion in funding to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Nadler said his fellow House Democrats intend to pass six appropriations bills to fund most of the government and a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) until Feb. 8.\n\nBecause his party's proposals do not include any additional funding for a border wall, it is unlikely that they will be backed by the president and a Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday to discuss the stalemate in negotiations.\n\nNadler said the partial shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is Mr. Trump's attempt to blackmail the American public because he feels beleaguered by criticism from his own party, high-profile resignations in his administration and looming Democratic control of the House.\n\nIt is an extremist policy designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country hostage, he said.
WASHINGTON -- Iran could comply with last summer's nuclear deal as early as Friday or this weekend, officials said, requiring the United States and other nations to immediately suspend billions of dollars' worth of economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry predicted Wednesday the achievement could happen within the next coming days.\n\nKerry also said Iran was in the process of disabling the central vessel, or calandria, for its heavy water reactor at Arak that would have been able to produce plutonium, a pathway to nuclear weapons.\n\nJust yesterday, the foreign minister (of Iran) reported to me that the calandria of the plutonium nuclear reactor is now out and in the next hours it will be filled with concrete and destroyed, Kerry said Wednesday.\n\nJust hours after welcoming Iran's release of 10 U.S. sailors it detained when their boats wandered on to an Iranian island in the Persian Gulf, Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University that implementation of the nuclear agreement will take place soon, without specifying an exact date.\n\nOthers in Washington and elsewhere told The Associated Press the announcement could come within two days. In Vienna, a senior diplomat from one of the six countries that cut the deal with Iran said it would be formally declared implemented most probably Friday. Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nIn Tehran, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi echoed that sentiment.\n\nHe said the International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to verify Iran's compliance on Friday and that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini would then announce implementation day, according to Iran's official IRNA news agency.\n\nI believe the parties will perform their undertakings by Friday and Saturday and Sunday and the implementation day would be announced on that time, Araghchi said.\n\nHe said the foreign ministers who negotiated the July accord - including Kerry, Zarif and their counterparts from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - may meet to deliver a joint statement. Kerry is expected to be in Europe this weekend on other business.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, once Iran meets its obligations to curb its nuclear program, it is to receive wide-ranging sanctions relief. For the U.S. that means suspension of nuclear-related sanctions on Iranian oil, banking and commerce.\n\nIran was required to ship out most of its stockpile of enriched uranium, a material that can be used for making bombs, and take apart thousands of the centrifuges that enrich the material. Most of the nuclear restrictions last 10 or 15 years.\n\nWhile Iran accomplished most of the biggest tasks in recent weeks, several technical hiccups remained. Officials had spoken of lingering questions related to Iran's uranium and plutonium programs, including over the properties of certain centrifuges Iran would be permitted to maintain for research purposes.\n\nIt's not clear how quickly Iran would reap the benefits of the deal.\n\nTehran expects to quickly recoup some $100 billion worth of its assets that have been frozen in overseas banks, a tremendous windfall for an economy with a GDP of little more than $400 billion in 2014.\n\nWhile the Iranians have aggressively courted foreign companies and investors in recent months, it is unclear how quickly contracts can be finalized. Also unknown is how determined major Western firms, in particular, will be given the risk of snapback sanctions if Iran violates the deal and the history of U.S. penalties against European banks that have previously conducted business with Iran.
American Airlines will no longer allow emotional support animals to travel on its planes other than as carry-on pets or in the cargo. The carrier is adopting a Department of Transportation rule that takes effect next week. It defines a service animal as a dog trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, a narrower definition than in the past.\n\nWhen the rule goes into effect January 11, American will no longer authorize new travel for animals that do not meet that definition, such as emotional support animals, the airline announced Tuesday in a news release.\n\nThe airline said existing bookings involving emotional support animals will be honored through February 1, when the company's new policies go into effect.\n\nAnimals that had previously traveled as emotional support animals and no longer qualify as service animals can travel as carry-on pets or in the cargo provided they meet the airline's requirements, American added. The airline will collect a pet fee ranging from $125 to several hundred dollars for transporting pets, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWe're confident this approach will enable us to better serve our customers, particularly those with disabilities who travel with service animals, and better protect our team members at the airport and on the aircraft, Jessica Tyler, president of cargo and vice president of airport excellence for American, said in a statement.\n\nAlaska Airlines a week ago also said it would no longer accept emotional support animals. Other airlines are also expected to adopt the new policy.\n\nThe Transportation Department early last month said it was reversing its long-held position that required airlines to allow passengers to travel with emotional support animals as long they had note from a doctor.\n\nThe agency's switch follows an increase in service animal complaints from passengers with disabilities, misbehavior by emotional support animals, a lack of clarity around the definition of service animal and disruptions caused by requests to transport unusual species of animals onboard aircraft, according to the DOT.\n\nAirlines for years have struggled to contend with travelers who brought a menagerie of animals on board, including cats, turtles, pigs and other creatures.\n\nHigh-profile incidents involving animals on flights include police being called to remove a woman with an emotional support squirrel from a 2018 Frontier Airlines flight and United Airlines bouncing a passenger who wanted to bring a peacock on board.
Investors seem unimpressed with the Federal Reserve's largest interest rate cut since 2008, pushing down stocks amid mounting concerns over the coronavirus.\n\nThe Dow fell 786 points, or almost 3%, to 25,917 on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes both slid about 3%. The decline followed a surprise move by the central bank to lower rates by 0.5% in a bid to bolster the U.S. economy as the coronavirus spreads to more states. The rate cut comes after seven major economies pledged early Tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the outbreak.\n\nThe subdued reaction of the equity market suggests a typical buy the rumor and sell the fact, and we continue to anticipate two weeks of high volatility in the markets, Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said in an email after the Fed's decisions.\n\nIn another sign investors are seeking refuge from market volatility, the price of 10-year Treasury notes surged, pushing the yield to below 1% — the first time that has ever happened, according to Bloomberg. The Fed said in a statement that while the U.S. economy remains strong, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.\n\nWall Street is weighing the impact of the coronavirus as more companies warn the outbreak will crimp profitability, while others cut back on employee travel and ask employees to work from home. The market decline on Tuesday follows yesterday's surge of 5.1%, when investors were buoyed by the prospect of a Fed rate cut. The Dow last plunged more than 12%, marking the fastest recorded slide into market correction territory — defined as a decline of at least 10% from a previous high.\n\nPresident Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not easing interest rates, pressed policy makers to do more even after the rate cut. More easing and cutting!, Mr. Trump said in a tweet.\n\nG-7 announcement\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the G-7 countries said they are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nThe joint statement from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. But investors were looking for concrete actions, analysts noted.\n\nGlobal equities were disappointed with the 175-word statement of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, said Edward Moya, senior market strategist at OANDA, in a research note issued before the Fed cut rates. Wall Street's patience will be tested as downward pressures grow for signs of a fiscal response.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb in the U.S. The new disease has killed six people in the U.S., four from one nursing home near Seattle and two others in the same county. The cluster of deaths at the nursing facility in Washington state's King County highlights the serious threat the disease poses to older people and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThere were just over 100 cases in 15 states as of Tuesday morning, with New Hampshire and Georgia being the most recent to join the battle against the virus.
If you're reading this from the comfort of your home office, you may want to thank IBM for helping to make that possible.\n\nThe technology giant that gave us the floppy disk, automated teller machine and Watson supercomputer has also been a trailblazer in terms of allowing employees to work remotely. IBM began allowing some of its employees to work at home during the Reagan era, and by 2009 40 percent of its 386,000 staffers worldwide were no longer tethered to a traditional office. Tens of thousands more worked remotely at least occasionally, according to a company report.\n\nNow, Big Blue -- which helped launch the work-from-home movement to slash its real estate costs and retain talent -- has become the latest corporate behemoth to call some of its troops back to the office. Honeywell, Yahoo, Best Buy, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America have made similar moves over the last several years. Like IBM, they cited the need to improve teamwork, idea-sharing, speed and agility.\n\nNeedless to say, not all their employees are thrilled. Some IBMers have reportedly polished up their resumes and begun looking for new jobs.\n\nAs more and more companies in the U.S. have adopted work-from-home policies, employees have grown to expect a measure of control over when and where they work -- and they appear to be getting it. Last year, 43 percent of employees worked remotely in some capacity, meaning they spent at least some of their time working in a different location than their co-workers, according to a Gallup report. That was up from 39 percent in 2012.\n\nIBM, however, is among a handful of big employers that are reversing course. Last month, the company informed its U.S. marketing team of about 2,600 people that working remotely on a full-time basis would no longer be an option, according to media accounts.\n\nIan Colley, an IBM spokesman, confirmed that marketing employees have been asked to work out of six new digital marketing facilities located in Austin, Texas; San Francisco; New York City; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Atlanta; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nAs a result, employees who worked remotely -- whether from home or an office other than the one to which they are now assigned -- will need to commute, move, change offices within the same city or find another job. Colley declined to say how many staffers are impacted by the policy change or when it takes effect.\n\nIBM is helping to pay moving expenses for workers who opt to relocate. For employees who need to move because of the new policy but can't for some reason, IBM will help them find other jobs internally, according to Colley.\n\nMost IBM marketing employees already work out of an office (rather than from home) and live within commuting distance of one of the six new facilities, he said.\n\nIBM remains committed to work-life balance and still allows members of co-located teams to sometimes work at home, Colley said. Those teams include not only marketing but also chief information officers, the Watson division and certain software development groups.\n\nAs marketing shifts to digital marketing, the need to work in an agile way becomes more apparent, said Colley, explaining the reason for the new marketing-department policy.\n\nMarketing is no longer a 'waterfall' type work process, where work is handed from one person to another. Modern marketing requires that people on a team be able to iterate programs in real-time based on live feedback. This requires them to collaborate much more closely, he added.\n\nIBM appears to be bucking a trend. On the whole, companies are offering workers greater flexibility in terms of when and where they work, and not just because it helps with their recruiting efforts. Studies have shown that employee engagement and productivity often improve as a result.\n\nIn 2016, 40 percent of large companies allowed employees to work at home at least some of the time on a regular basis, up from 33 percent in 2012, according to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management and the Families and Work Institute.\n\nMany companies allow working from home because it holds down their office-rental costs and the low- or no-value-added time workers spend commuting, particularly in cities with heavy rush-hour traffic, explained Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family, whose corporate sponsors include IBM.\n\nA lot of times people think of [working from home] as an accommodation for working parents, but that's not necessarily the case, he explained. There are organizational benefits to it, added Harrington.\n\nThere may also be organizational costs in terms of teamwork, innovation and corporate culture, experts said.\n\nYou start to get an erosion of corporate culture when you have workers spread far and wide, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive officer of staff and recruiting firm LaSalle Network in Chicago.\n\nThe same can be said for the culture of colleges that specialize in online programs, Gimbel added. You don't see many people wearing a college sweatshirt for the University of Phoenix, he noted.\n\nFor employees, there may be some drawbacks to working from home from a career-growth perspective, Gimbel said. Less face-time with higher ups could be a liability.\n\nYour opportunities for promotion are less if you're not in the office interacting with senior management, he said.
Thanks to a post-earnings lift from Boeing (BA), the Dow Jones industrials ended a five-day losing streak on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite wasn't as lucky, however, posting its fifth straight loss.\n\nTreasury yields and corporate earnings remain the focus, with the 10-year Treasury pushing further above the 3 percent level on Wednesday, closing at 3.03 percent -- a high not seen since 2014. The 2-year Treasury hit 2.49 percent -- its highest close in nearly a decade.\n\nA combination of factors are behind these upward moves, including expectations of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike in June, rising inflation expectations and growing evidence that wage inflation is just around the corner.\n\nHistorical data comparing the relationship of job availability vs. wage gains shows -- if history is any guide -- that pay raises are coming. Which will provide the raw fuel needed to push up prices throughout the economy.\n\nWatch for Fed policymakers to explore this point in their statement due next week. Currently, the futures market has essentially priced in another quarter-point hike at the Fed's June meeting. But the odds of an accelerating pace of rate increases is rising, with a 38 percent chance of three more this year (for a total of four), up from a 28 percent chance a month again.\n\nThis policy and inflation outlook is overshadowing what has been an extremely strong first-quarter earnings season so far. According to FactSet, S&P 500 earnings growth so far is tracking at 18.3 percent vs. last year's first quarter, with record high net profit margins.\n\nJust look at Facebook (FB), which jumped 6.8 percent in after-hours trading following its report of earnings of $1.69 per share vs. $1.36 estimated on $12 billion in ad revenue. Daily active users increased 13 percent over last year, laying to rest the #DeleteFacebook fears.\n\nBut echoing the cautiousness of Caterpillar (CAT) management on Tuesday, who warned that the company's first-quarter results could be a high water mark for 2018 profitability, investors seem to be increasingly aware that the rest of this year may not be a walk in the park for stocks. Worries are growing that higher interest rates will jeopardize many of the tailwinds the bulls have enjoyed for years: debt-funded share buybacks, cheap consumer credit, affordable mortgages, low auto loan payments and higher bond prices.
Washington — Seven major economies, including the U.S., pledged Tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the spreading coronavirus, while stopping short of immediate actions. The group of major industrial countries, referred to as the G-7, said it was ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nThe joint statement from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nGiven the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks, the G-7 said.\n\nThe G-7 has issued similar statements during periods of market turmoil, such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nMarkets soared Monday amid a growing conviction by investors that the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world would cut interest rates in a move to shore up economic growth. Wall Street analysts expect Fed officials to lower rates at their next meeting on March 17-18 and possibly again in April.\n\nDespite the G-7's commitment to work together, the group's response appeared to disappoint some on Wall Street.\n\nThis is a disappointment compared to previous hopes of an immediate and coordinated fiscal package and interest rate cuts, although such hopes had already been dampened by information leaked from 'G7 officials' early this morning, Jennifer McKeown, head of global economics service at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\nThe research firm has said it expects the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. to climb exponentially in the coming weeks and for economic growth to slow. Capital Economics expects the Fed to cut rates by a total of 0.5% by mid-year due to the virus.\n\nCarl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics said in a report that investors were hoping for a lot more from the G-7 announcement.\n\nStock futures in the U.S. were flat Tuesday ahead of the start of trade.
One of Sydney Chaffee's students describes her as blunt, calm and nice at the same time. Others in her classroom in Dorchester, Massachusetts, say she's a good listener – simply the best.\n\nSydney Chaffee CBS News\n\nChaffee, who's among the 3.1 million teachers who educate the 50.4 million public school students across the country, was honored Thursday as the 2017 National Teacher of the Year. The 9th grade humanities teacher has spent 10 years at Codman Academy, a charter public school where 98 percent of the students are minorities and 75 percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. One hundred percent of Codman Academy's graduates are accepted into college.\n\nThe magic behind her effectiveness and popularity is a deep desire to make change and to build relationships with kids.\n\nI want my students to understand that they are powerful and that they can make change in the world. That whatever the future is that they want to see, they have the power and they have the agency to make that happen, and so that's at the core of everything that we're doing, Chaffee said on CBS This Morning.\n\nAt Codman Academy, it's school policy for the students call teachers by their first names.\n\nWe want to just sort of show that we're on the same level, and it's a community and we have relationships, Chaffee said.\n\nShe also stresses social justice in her classroom.\n\nWe learn a lot about history, and the history of people who have been oppressed and the history of people who have been marginalized and how those people have fought for justice, Chaffee explained. So we learn about resistance movements and then we sort of relate that to today and say, 'OK, so what can we learn from this, and how will you be a powerful person in the world?'\n\nAs a teacher, she recognizes that she herself can always learn more.\n\nSo this award is so humbling because I always am thinking about how I can be better at this job, and I know that all of my colleagues are always thinking that too. And so that's another part of the magic ... that teachers understand that we're learners. We're always learners and we model that for our kids, Chaffee said.
Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico — A new caravan of around 1,800 Central Americans is making its way toward the U.S. The group started crossing into Mexico last weekend, and the long line to enter stretches back to a bridge on the border.\n\nThousands of migrants left Honduras a week ago after word about a new caravan spread on Facebook. The orderly lines are a stark contrast to October's caravan, when an influx of migrants overwhelmed the Mexican government and created a bottleneck on the same bridge. Some jumped to swim to Mexico instead, and other migrants tore down a fence to gain entry.\n\nWhere there was once a fence, there's now a gate that is wide open. But migrants have to wait on a long line. It's the result of Mexico's new open-door migration policy that is just a week old.\n\nEvery migrant that enters legally first gets a bracelet. With their wristband, they can get a humanitarian visa, which takes about five days. Once inside, migrants are photographed, interviewed, fingerprinted and get iris recognition scans to keep track of who is entering.\n\nMarcos Alonzo, who earned $4 a day back home, left Honduras a week ago with a group. Though he could stay in Mexico for under the new policy, he's bound for the U.S. He said he has heard about President Trump's border wall, but doesn't think it will go up by the time he arrives at the border.\n\nOf the thousands of migrants that made it to the U.S. border in the last major caravan, less than 700 remain in Tijuana hoping for asylum.\n\nCBS News asked officials in Mexico if they are incentivizing migrants to come north. They said the migrants will come no matter what and legal migration provides rights and protections. The question is how many will stay in Mexico and how many will head to the U.S.
Baghdad — Iraq issued a warrant for the arrest of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday as part of a Baghdad court's investigation into the killing of a top Iraqi paramilitary commander. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of Iraq's largely pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, died in the same U.S. drone strike that killed storied Iranian general Qasem Soleimani at Baghdad airport on January 3 last year.\n\nThe strike on their motorcade was ordered by Mr. Trump, who later crowed that it had taken out two (men) for the price of one.\n\nAn arrest warrant against the outgoing President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has been issued in accordance with the provisions of Article 406 of the Iraqi Penal Code, Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council confirmed in a statement on Thursday, adding that the investigations would continue to identify others who participated in committing this crime, whether they are Iraqis or foreigners.\n\nThe United Nations special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Agnes Callamard, has described the twin killings as arbitrary and illegal.\n\nIran already issued a warrant for Mr. Trump's arrest in June, and asked Interpol to relay it as a so-called red notice to other police forces around the world. Interpol made it clear there was no intention to meet Iran's request.\n\nUnlike adversary Iran, Iraq is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. While the U.S. military presence in the country has diminished significantly under President Trump's orders, to around 2,500 troops at present, billions of U.S. tax dollars have been spent, and American forces have been killed, shoring the Iraqi government up to defend itself from terrorist groups, and to help it resist the influence of its neighbor to the north, Iran.\n\nA member of Lebanon's Hezbollah stands in front of a picture depicting senior Iranian military commander General Qassem Soleimani (right) and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis who were killed in a U.S. attack, during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of their killing in the southern village of Khiam, Lebanon, January 3, 2021. AZIZ TAHER/REUTERS\n\nIt was the court for east Baghdad that actually issued the warrant for Mr. Trump's arrest under Article 406 of Iraq's penal code, which provides for the death penalty in all cases of premeditated murder, but the Supreme Judicial Council, which runs all of Iraq's courts much like the U.S. Department of Justice, confirmed the warrant.\n\nWhile the soon-to-be former U.S. president may be unlikely to visit Iraq any time soon, the order for his arrest highlights the huge resentment against U.S. policy in Iraq, and the deeply entrenched influence of Iran among Iraq's large Shiite Muslim population.\n\nThe U.S. military had braced for any possible retaliatory attacks by Iran or Iraq's pro-Iran militias, which have fired rockets at American bases many times since the strike last year, but there was no violence on the anniversary of the attack over the weekend.\n\nIraq's national government has at times struggled to maintain cordial relations with both its biggest global partner, Washington, and its neighbor Iran.\n\nEven as the court issued the arrest warrant on Thursday, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller met nearby in Baghdad with President Barham Salih to discuss the importance of reducing tensions and avoiding escalation, supporting efforts to enhance security, stability and peace in the region, and resolving the outstanding issues through dialogue, according to a statement posted on Salih's Twitter feed (below).
As vaccinations continue across the U.S., some companies are offering financial incentives to encourage their workers to get their shots.\n\nInstacart Inc., the grocery delivery service, announced Thursday that it would provide a $25 stipend for workers who get the COVID-19 vaccine. It joins others, including Trader Joe's and Dollar General, which plan to pay workers extra if they get vaccinated.\n\nOur goal with the introduction of our new vaccine support stipend is to ensure that, when the time comes, Instacart shoppers don't have to choose between earning income as an essential service provider or getting vaccinated, Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco-based Instacart has nearly doubled its mostly gig workforce to about 500,000 to meet a surge in demand for online grocery shopping since the pandemic erupted in the U.S. last spring.\n\nGrocery chain Trader Joe's, which has more than 50,000 employees, said Thursday it will give its employees two hours of pay per dose for getting the vaccine. The Monrovia, California-based company said it will also shift around schedules to make sure employees have time to get vaccinated.\n\nDollar General said Wednesday it will give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they get the vaccine. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based retailer said it employs 157,000 people.\n\nA vaccine advisory panel at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control voted late last month on recommendations for vaccine distribution. The panel said grocery workers — which would include Instacart and Dollar General's employees — should be in the second group to receive shots after health care workers and nursing home residents.\n\nIt is up to each state to decide how and when to adopt the CDC's recommendations. Some states have already opened eligibility to the second group, which also includes firefighters, police, teachers, corrections workers, postal employees and people 75 and older. There are around 50 million people in that group.\n\nCompanies can mandate that workers get COVID-19 vaccines as a requirement for employment, although they must make accommodations for medical or religious reasons, according to guidance from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nHowever, most companies are reluctant to impose such mandates, said Sharon Perley Masling, a partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis who has been advising clients on workplace issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency nature of the vaccine's FDA approval makes it impractical for many companies to require it, given that the shots are not available to most of the population, she said.\n\nStill, Masling said the companies she works with are taking various steps to strongly encourage their workers to get vaccinated, including internal public relations campaigns showing top executives who are eligible getting the shots. Other incentives include free child care, paid time off and freebies such as pizza delivery and other gifts, she said.\n\nIt's good for employees, it's good for their communities and it's good for ensuring the continuation of business operations, Masling said.\n\nThe push to vaccinate comes amid signs that some people — even health care workers — are reluctant to get the shots, contributing to a slower-than-hoped-for rollout of the mass vaccination effort in the U.S. Masling said many companies are still trying to figure out how their staff feels about taking the shots, with some sending out internal surveys.\n\nConcerns over side effects\n\nIn a survey last month by the Society for Human Resource Management, nearly two-thirds of U.S. workers said they were likely to get the vaccine when it becomes available. Still, 36% said they were not likely to get vaccinated, citing as their main reason concerns about side effects. SHRM surveyed workers from 529 U.S. households using the AmeriSpeak Omnibus survey, a probability-based panel developed by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nScientists say the vaccines have been rigorously tested on tens of thousands and vetted by independent experts, and there have been no signs of widespread severe side effects from the shots.\n\nNot every company is offering incentives. Delivery app DoorDash, another big platform for gig workers, said it has asked the CDC and governors to prioritize delivery workers in vaccine distribution. But it doesn't plan to provide perks for workers who get vaccinated.\n\nTarget Corp. doesn't plan to provide incentives either, but said it will make the vaccine free and accessible to its 350,000 employees. Target said 1,700 of its stores have a CVS pharmacy on site that will offer the vaccine to staff when it's available.\n\nAlbertsons, a grocery chain with 2,250 U.S. stores and 300,000 employees, also isn't doling out financial incentives. Like DoorDash, it's asking state and local authorities to make sure its workers get priority for the vaccine.\n\nA separate SHRM survey last month found that while about two-thirds of U.S. employers planned to encourage employees to get vaccinated, only 3% have decided to require it for at least some workers. That could change, since 55% of employers said they were unsure if they would eventually require it, according to survey of 955 members of SHRM, an organization of about 300,000 human resource professionals.\n\nBad press\n\nMany large companies have faced criticism over how they have treated their employees throughout the pandemic, from shoddy sick leave policies to poor working conditions. Companies, ranging from meatpacking plants to Amazon, have grappled with worker absences and outbreaks that have forced temporary shutdowns of their factories and warehouses. There is also a looming debate in Congress over whether employers should be exempt from legal liabilities related to coronavirus exposure, as more begin to recall their employees back to offices and other work sites.\n\nPublic perception provides a strong incentive for companies to get their workers vaccinated, said Laura Boudreau, an economics professor at Columbia Business School who specializes in labor rights.\n\nA lot of them have had to defend their reputations in terms of how they are treating their employees throughout the pandemic, Boudreau said.\n\nInstacart is among several companies that have lobbied for their workers to be prioritized for vaccines. The company also has faced criticism, and some worker unrest, over allegations that it had not done enough to protect its shoppers — gig workers who make multiple trips a day to grocery stores to shop for and deliver groceries to people who order on its app — who don't receive health insurance through the company or guaranteed paid sick leave.\n\nThe company says it has distributed 620,000 free safety kits to its workers, including face masks and hand sanitizers. It introduced a new policy in March to provide 14 days of paid leave for gig workers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been ordered to quarantine because of potential exposure.
Amazon is asking third-party sellers to stop shipping most goods to its warehouses as the online retailer grapples with a coronavirus-fueled surge in demand for medical supplies and household products.\n\nThe ecommerce company told sellers in a note on Tuesday that it will only ship household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products unless Amazon already has other purchased items on hand in its warehouses.\n\nThe pause lasts through at least April 5 and will apply to Amazon shipments in the U.S. and European Union. Products already in Amazon warehouses, or those currently in transit on their way to the facilities, will not be affected, the company said.\n\nThe change affects third-party shippers that rely on Amazon's fulfillment service, as well merchants who sell directly to Amazon. Sellers that package and ship their own goods will not be affected by the temporary change in policy..\n\nWe are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock, Amazon told CBS MoneyWatchh in a statement. With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.\n\nProducts that Amazon is prioritizing for shipment must fall into one of six categories, according to the company:\n\nbaby products\n\nhealth and household products\n\nbeauty and personal care products (including personal care appliances)\n\ngrocery products\n\nindustrial and scientific products\n\npet supplies.\n\nAmazon told customers last weekend that waits for some products could take longer than the usual two days. Many common items, such as soap and diapers, were listed as unavailable on Tuesday.\n\nThird-party businesses constitute most of the sellers on Amazon's vast platform, generating more sales than even the products sold directly by Amazon, according to Business Insider. While they are independent businesses, these sellers often heavily rely on Amazon and have little say in setting the terms of their interaction.\n\nWe understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly. We are working around the clock to increase capacity, Amazon wrote in its note.\n\nThat didn't assuage many sellers, with some writing that the change could put them out of business. Others called for compassion for the workers who pack and ship Amazon goods and whose jobs don't allow them to work from home during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFor most of us, this would mean inconvenience. For those at risk, it means a matter of life and death, one poster wrote in a seller forum.\n\nAmazon has faced a surge in orders as coronavirus panic sets in across the U.S. and more people shop online. The company announced on Monday it would hire 100,000 additional workers to deal with unprecedented labor needs.
Iowa Rep. Steve King is facing criticism after he defended white nationalism and white supremacy in an interview. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? King said to The New York Times. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\n\nHe later posted a statement to Twitter, after the interview was published, saying, I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology represented by those terms. I am simply a Nationalist, he said, not a white nationalist or white supremacist.\n\nI condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives, he wrote. Like the Founding Fathers, he wrote, I am an advocate for Western Civilization's values.\n\nKing, one of the most right-wing members of Congress, also told Times that he is not a racist, saying his Twitter timeline shows him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. He said he supports immigrants who come to the U.S. legally and assimilate, since the culture of America matters more than race.\n\nMy statement on the New York Times article. pic.twitter.com/IjBHgZYgRD — Steve King (@SteveKingIA) January 10, 2019\n\nSeveral top Republicans spoke out to condemn the remark. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation. Steve's language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. The Declaration of Independence states that 'all men are created equal.' That is a fact. It is self-evident.\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise said, I think it is offensive to try to legitimize those terms. I think it was important that he rejected that kind of evil because that's what it is, it's evil ideology.\n\nAnd the number three House Republican leader, GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, blasted King's remarks, tweeting about the Times interview, These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.\n\nThese comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse. Steve King asks how terms 'white nationalist' and 'white supremacist' became offensive | TheHill https://t.co/yL23avpNFB — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) January 10, 2019\n\nKing's comments come as he is facing a primary challenge in 2020 from state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King fended off a challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten in 2018, although he won by a narrower margin than he has in the past.\n\nIn the interview, King credits himself with President Trump's shift to his own hardline views on immigration. Donald Trump came to Iowa as a real nonideological candidate, King said. He recalled telling Mr. Trump, I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something. King in the past has shown a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed on the House floor.\n\nKing, 69, has attained notoriety for statements and positions that appeal to white nationalists. His history of controversial comments caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to rescind all support for him before the 2018 election, with NRCC chairman Steve Stivers condemning him and white supremacy and hate. King has lost support from a number of prominent corporate donors, and the state's Republican governor has also spoken out against him.\n\n-CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan contributed reporting.
Amman, Jordan — The United Arab Emirates said Friday that it would reopen all of its land, sea and air borders with Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar, the latest significant step to end a crisis that was a major diplomatic thorn in the side of U.S. policy for several years. In a statement carried by the country's official news agency, UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said the end of his country's blockade of Qatar would include practical measures of airlines, shipping and trade.\n\nThe move followed a Gulf Cooperation Council summit on Tuesday in the ancient Saudi city of Al-Ula, where a breakthrough agreement marked the end of the rift between Qatar and its neighbors. Late on Monday, Saudi Arabia, the biggest country involved in the blockade, said it would reopen its airspace and land border to Qatar in the first step toward ending the crisis.\n\nSaudi Arabian television carried live pictures of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman warmly welcoming Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani to the summit. The pictures from the tarmac at the Saudi airport sent a powerful signal.\n\nEmir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani (L) is welcomed by Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the 41st Summit of Gulf Cooperation Council in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, January 5, 2021. Royal Council of Saudi Arabia/Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nThe breakthrough came after an extensive diplomatic push led by President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. It also came just ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's swearing in.\n\nThe incoming U.S. administration is expected to take a firmer stance towards the kingdom than President Trump, whose family has close ties with the Saudi royals.\n\nThe blockade began in 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt accused the tiny state of Qatar of supporting Islamic extremists — charges Qatar has always firmly denied.\n\nQatar not only survived, but managed largely to avoid any serious impact from the blockade thanks to its wealth, accumulated over decades from vast natural gas reserves.\n\nThe GCC leaders signed an agreement this week for a complete resumption of diplomatic relations between the boycotting Arab quartet and Qatar, and to jointly confront any threats to Gulf security.\n\nThe chief threat alluded to in the statement by the Gulf nations was that posed by their other neighbor, Iran. The U.S. government has long relied on its allies in the Gulf to present a united front against the Shiite Muslim powerhouse.\n\nQatar Airways has announced that its planes will return to using Saudi airspace. During the blockade, the airline was forced to divert most of its flights through Iranian airspace, and Washington was keen to deprive Tehran of the hundreds of millions of dollars in overflight fees the Qataris were paying.\n\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, England, July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nSpeaking at a virtual news conference on Thursday, Gargash, the UAE's top diplomat, said his country was behind this deal, and positive about the prospect of reestablishing relations with Qatar.\n\nHe added, however, that restoring full diplomatic ties would take time and depended on Qatar's future dealings with Iran, Turkey and Islamic extremist groups. We have a very good start, said Gargash, but we have issues with rebuilding trust.\n\nThe basic issues that the Emiratis are talking about are still there, Dr. Hassan Barari, professor of international relations at Qatar University, told CBS News on Friday. The differences are going to continue, but the problem is how to manage these differences.\n\nPeople here in Doha insist on their right to have a different foreign policy, Barari said of Qatar's leadership. The reconciliation with Saudi Arabia is very important for Qataris, but for them it is more important to be independent.
With four days to go until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly.\n\nI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind. Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors Medicare for All and free college tuition at public universities.\n\nI hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, Buttigieg continued. And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\n\nButtigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a risk at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump.\n\nButtigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The most recent Des Moines Register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.\n\nThe millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden.\n\nWhile maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\n\nThis is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, Buttigieg said. The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better. After his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. We're competing, Buttigieg told reporters. It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.\n\nMeanwhile, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes that at a speech in Newton, Iowa, Biden spoke about the importance of 2020 Democrats focusing on Mr. Trump and not swinging at each other. The former vice president said we shouldn't let this Democratic race slide into negative attacks. The temptation is too much for some Biden added, while highlighting President Obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden delivered a speech in Waukee, Iowa where he didn't name a single rival Democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. In the home stretch, Biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: The soul of the nation is at risk due to Mr. Trump's actions and moral turpitude.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nAs Joe Biden goes up on the air in Nevada with several new ads in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per Kantar CMAG data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Among them are two former Clark County party chairs, the vice president of the Washoe County School District Board of Trustees, and online betting CEO Joe Asher, who was listed last year as a top fundraising bundler for Biden.\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG\n\nThursday Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his Super Bowl Ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in America, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.\n\nThe 60 second spot, titled George, will air Sunday February 2 during Super Bowl LIV. It features the story of Calandrian Simpson Kemp, a mother whose son, George Kemp Jr., was shot and killed in 2013.\n\nIn the aftermath of her son's death, Kemp has been an active member of Moms Demand Action. I chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, Bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.\n\nCalandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of Washington to address it. People will be rooting for different teams in the Super Bowl, but virtually all Americans — including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners — support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws.\n\nBloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. Despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including Iowa where voting begins Monday, Bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nEquality California, the state's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, and its recently-launched Nevada partner Silver State Equality announced Thursday they would be backing Pete Buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the former South Bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in California, where Buttigieg has failed to crack double digits in recent polls of the Super Tuesday contest.\n\nWhile we did not endorse Mayor Pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the LGBTQ community, Rick Zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer for their extremely strong platforms.\n\nTULSI GABBARD\n\nCongresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January.\n\nA recent analysis by the New York Times reveals just one-fifth of Obama-Trump voters returned to the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted Republican. Roughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.\n\n[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, Bannon told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nBernie Sanders' first TV ads to air in Super Tuesday states are up today in California and Texas. In a 30-second ad aired in Dallas and Los Angeles this morning for the first time, Sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. That's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system, Sanders says on camera.\n\nCBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. In another ad aired in Dallas and San Francisco, a narrator talks about Sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care.\n\nOur country is at a turning point. Hard working people betrayed by Trump struggling to survive, the narrator claims. In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has, the voice concludes. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in California and more than $160,000 in Texas through February 25th, but more ad buys are likely. On Tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. Super Tuesday is March 3rd.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nThe Trump Campaign released one of two ads set to air during the Super Bowl on Thursday, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The 30-second ad released Thursday morning called Stronger, Safer, More prosperous highlights the record unemployment numbers the United States has seen during the first three years of the Trump administration. According to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game.\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nWith the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. I think some campaigns have reached out to our team, Andrew Yang told reporters at an event yesterday, CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reported.\n\nA source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nGEORGIA\n\nA popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a Democrat in the special election for U.S. Senate in Georgia. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson reports that Reverend Ralphael Warnock, the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, announced his U.S. Senate bid Thursday in a Twitter video. Warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.\n\nMatt Lieberman, the son of former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Ed Tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the Democratic nomination. Nevertheless, Warnock's entry could rally Democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided Republican Party in the Peach State.\n\nThe special election is being held to fill the seat held by former Senator Johnny Isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. Governor Brian Kemp appointed financial executive Kelly Loeffler to Isakson's Senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. Loeffler will run in the special election in November to carry out the final two years of Isakson's term, and she has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund. However, Congressman Doug Collins announced his bid for the seat on Wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the GOP.\n\nDemocrats are targeting a number of House seats in Georgia, as well as the state's two Senate seats. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, but Democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nThe House Democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the Senate's inaction on the House's H.R. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive Democrat districts. Bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. Let's just remember the election is nine months off, Bustos said. We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.\n\nDespite setting their own off-year record, the Republican campaign arm was outraised by the DCCC by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable Democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. Two such members, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Anthony Brindisi of New York, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside Republican groups about impeachment.\n\nBustos, a Democrat from a district won by Mr. Trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of Democrats she says have compelling arguments. They've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. Cindy Axne's done 57 town hall meetings, Joe Cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…Lauren Underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. When you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. And I think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.\n\nBustos also said after he dropped out, Beto O'Rourke reached out to the DCCC offering his help if needed. The DCCC themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro, about potential involvement in the House election cycle. Where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
The U.S. economy has thrown Federal Reserve policymakers a wicked curveball ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week: A sudden, unexpected slowdown in the pace of job gains was reported on Friday.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way. For months, Fed officials have responded to a surge in business confidence, consumer sentiment and stock market prices by preparing for further rate hikes this year. More recently, the Fed has also openly discussed the process of tapering its $4 trillion-plus balance sheet swollen by years of bond-buying stimulus.\n\nBut now, with jobs slowing, auto sales braking and the economic data overall disappointing on a scale not seen since early 2015, the Fed suddenly looks out of sync. While equities remain unshakable -- thanks mainly to a persistent bid in megacap tech stocks like Amazon (AMZN) -- other asset classes are responding: Gold is rising, long-term interest rates are falling and the dollar is losing ground.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent last month (lowest since May 2001), it was the result of a reduction in the labor force. Total payrolls grew just 138,000 vs. the 185,000 expected, which was below the lowest estimate. Moreover, April and March job gains were revised lower by a net 66,000. It was an ugly showing.\n\nAt this late hour, it's unlikely to keep the Fed from raising rates by another quarter-point at its June meeting. Indeed, futures market odds of a rate rise this month strengthened on Friday's jobs news, rising to 94.6 percent from 92.3 percent prior. On May 5, the odds stood at 78.5 percent.\n\nBut for the rest of the year, the outlook for further rate hikes is dimming somewhat: The odds of a one-and-done at the June meeting, with the Fed holding pat through the end of the year, rose to nearly 50 percent from just 37.7 percent a month ago.\n\nDeutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna doesn't believe the downshift in economic data is enough to completely derail the Fed's current rate-hike policy, however, since it reflects the intense tightening underway in the labor market. This is not unlike what's happening in the housing market, where robust demand is being limited by scarce supply of homes for sale, lowering deal volume. Simply too few qualified workers are in the labor force. Thus, hiring is slowing.\n\nAt time point, assuming the economic expansion continues, businesses will be forced to choose between continuing to forgo new hires (and limiting their ability to grow) or getting into a bidding war for the best workers by paying more. The latter would lead to the much-delayed, long-heralded boost to wage inflation -- and would deliver a much-needed salve to middle-class incomes.\n\nIn response, LaVorgna is looking not only for a hike this month and an unveiling of a balance-sheet tapering plan in September, but another quarter-point hike in December. That would push short-term interest rates to 1.5 percent.\n\nSo far, stocks are agreeing with this optimistic outlook. But bonds, currencies and commodities are suggesting otherwise, pointing to a deflationary future reflective of a possible policy error by the Fed.\n\nWe'll know more about where the economic data is pointing this week, with an update on labor productivity and costs on Monday and job openings on Tuesday.
President-elect Joe Biden introduced members of his science team on Saturday. He says science will always be at the forefront of my administration, and is elevating the post of science adviser to Cabinet level — a White House first.\n\nBiden said the scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts and the truth.\n\nA pioneer in mapping the human genome — the book of life — is in line to be director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and adviser on science. Eric Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and was the lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome. He would be the first life scientist to have that White House job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.\n\nIn accepting his nomination, Lander said the opportunities we have, and the challenges we face, are greater than ever before, but stressed that no nation is better equipped to address these challenges because no nation is as diverse. No one can top America in that regard, Lander said. But we have to make sure not only that everyone has a seat at the table, but a spot at the lab bench.\n\nDr. Alondra Nelson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who Mr. Biden has picked to be deputy science policy chief, also emphasized the importance in expanding opportunities in the STEM fields. As a Black woman researcher, I am keenly aware of who is missing from these rooms, Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, said of her career.\n\nFrances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will lead the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration. Zuber said she hopes to restore trust in science, and pursue breakthroughs that benefit all people.\n\nThe president-elect also said on Friday he is retaining the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project. Biden also is naming two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\n\nCollins, in an email statement, called Lander brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.\n\nI predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science, Collins said.\n\nThe job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.\n\nScience organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.\n\nElevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion, said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.\n\nLander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur genius fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.\n\nLander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his Achilles' heel: I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris said she was particularly excited about the administration's push to elevate science due to her upbringing. Harris said her mother, an endocrinologist, lived by the scientific method, teaching her daughters that it's not a failure to reevaluate a hypothesis when the facts don't line up.\n\nPresident-elect Biden and I will not only listen to science, we will invest in it.\n\nCorrection: The Associated Press erroneously reported the institution for Alondra Nelson. She is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton University.
Washington — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to enforce its most ambitious effort yet to restrict legal immigration, giving U.S. officials the green light to implement a sweeping rule that critics warn will shut America's doors to low-income immigrants and people of color.\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling, the conservative-leaning high court approved the Trump administration's request to set aside a ruling by a federal judge blocking the so-called public charge regulation while the merits of the case continue to be argued in lower courts. The court's conservatives, including President Trump's appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, agreed to allow officials to enforce the policy, while the liberal justices would've denied the administration's request\n\nBy dramatically expanding the definition of a public charge, or an economic burden on society, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) regulation unveiled in August gives officials more power to deny visas and green card applications from immigrants and prospective immigrants whom the government determines rely, or could rely, on certain public benefits like food stamps and government housing programs.\n\nFor decades, the U.S. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge on the country, but the new rule scraps Clinton-era guidance that said only the use of cash benefits could be analyzed by immigration caseworkers.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the new restrictions as a way to ensure immigrants are self-sufficient. But opponents believe the policy is an attempt by the White House to circumvent laws passed by Congress by instituting what's essentially a wealth test designed to limit the immigration of poorer people from developing countries.\n\nIf you listen to Trump talking about how he wants a points-based immigration system and wants people who are wealthier, better educated, higher skilled and not from countries he's spoken of in derogatory, profane language — this is it. This is the policy that aims to do that, without Congress approving it whatsoever, said Doug Rand, a former White House official under President Obama who co-founded Boundless, a company to help immigrants navigate the U.S. immigration system.\n\nIt's a way to screen out people, not just from developing countries, but from any country, that the government has decided aren't wealthy enough, aren't healthy enough and don't speak English well enough, Rand added.\n\nSoon after its final version was published last summer, the public charge rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge calling it repugnant to the American dream. However, in recent weeks, circuit courts lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions against it, leaving only an order by a federal judge in New York standing.\n\nEarlier in January, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to set aside the remaining nationwide injunction — a request that has now been granted. U.S. immigration officials will now be able to implement the new restrictions in every part of the country other than Illinois, where the rule is still blocked under a statewide injunction.\n\nIn a concurring opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch expressed profound concerns about lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions that transcend the cases before them. He said both the government and those suing it are rushing through cases with national implications in the hopes of obtaining emergency rulings, instead of methodically developing arguments.\n\nThe routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions, Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, an immigration hawk and the second highest-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, said his department is making preparations to enforce the public charge policy following the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nSelf-sufficiency and self-reliance are key American values not to be litigiously dismissed, but to be encouraged and adopted by the next generation of immigrants, Cuccinelli said in a statement Monday evening. We plan to fully implement this rule in 49 states and are confident we will win the case on the merits.\n\nExpanding the definition of public charge\n\nThe term dates back to 1882, when the U.S. was trying to limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. The year it was first codified, the U.S. also enacted the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the entry of most Chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant might be a public charge. The Trump administration's policy substantially expands this term by broadening the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the U.S.\n\nUnder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including Section 8 vouchers.\n\nOfficials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. On certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nTo determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their wealth, age, educational skills, English language proficiency and health. Since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they aren't U.S. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.\n\nThis regulation is not about public benefits, except insofar as it's scaring people to stay away from public benefits — even when they don't have to, said Rand, the former Obama official.\n\nWhat the rule really does is it imposes a 25-factor test that's never been done before, that Congress has never authorized, that is going to make it less likely for someone to get a green card based on their age, their income, their heath, the number of children they have, whether they have a mortgage or student loans and a whole bunch of other things that have nothing to do with public benefits, he added.\n\nImmigrant advocates are concerned about the effects the rule could have on people who are technically not subject to it. Researchers have documented a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that have prompted some fearful immigrant families, including families that include U.S. citizens, to drop out of benefits programs.\n\nThe stringent requirements proposed by the public charge rule are not the only moves the administration has taken to impose limits on legal immigration.\n\nIn October, the White House issued a proclamation allowing the government to reject visa applications from would-be immigrants it determines won't be able to cover their medical costs. The plan, which is still being held up in court, could deny entry to approximately 375,000 prospective immigrants each year, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nA proposed rule by USCIS published in November would hike petition fees for immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, for young undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers trying to renew protections from deportation and for victims of crimes who are seeking to stay in the country through their assistance to law enforcement. The proposal would also make the U.S. one of only four nations that require asylum-seekers fleeing persecution to pay a fee to file affirmative requests for protection.\n\nJan Crawford contributed reporting.
U.S. equities drifted lower on Friday as buyer exhaustion set in after an exciting week.\n\nCooling investors' ardor were mixed tech earnings, lingering disappointment with President Donald Trump's tax proposal from Wednesday, a lack of progress on health insurance reform and worries about a potential government shutdown. But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak initial reading of first-quarter U.S. GDP. Growth came in at just 0.7 percent as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009.\n\nBut the stock market's losses were really quite modest, with Nasdaq even pushing to a new intraday high at the open. Wall Street, it seems, tried to focus on the silver linings in the report ahead of another busy week of economic reports and a Federal Reserve moneary policy decision on Wednesday.\n\nThe GDP report sure wasn't pretty: Growth slowed from the 2.1 percent pace set in 2016's fourth quarter to its worst pace in three years (chart below). Personal consumption increased just 0.3 percent following a 3.5 percent expansion in the previous quarter, which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Inventories were a drag.\n\nBright spots included nonresidential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending, especially in the mining sector) and residential investment, which increased at a 13.7 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate for its second straight quarter of very strong gains. The export gap also narrowed, slightly.\n\nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, doesn't believe the weak first-quarter performance will keep the Fed from hiking rates again in June. Aside from the silver linings outlined above, he noted a tendency for weakness in first quarters that seasonal adjustments haven't fully accommodated. Since 2011, the average growth rate for the quarter is just 0.9 percent vs. 2.4 percent in each of the other three.\n\nAnother likely drag was unseasonably warm weather, which reduced consumer spending for utilities.\n\nOverall, IHS Markit expects full-year 2017 GDP growth to come in around 2.5 percent, led by the double-digit gain in residential investment, the best growth in five quarters.\n\nWe'll know more when the Fed holds its policy meeting on Wednesday, May 3, and when the latest jobs numbers are released next Friday. Also coming are updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry) and fresh data on labor costs and productivity.
U.S. commandos have captured a chemical weapons expert for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports.\n\nThe capture has led to at least one strike in Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, which was designed to destroy a building where mustard gas munitions were believed to be manufactured. There are 12 reported instances of ISIS using mustard gas on the battlefield.\n\nIt's the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive policy of pursuing the jihadis on the ground.\n\nThe Obama administration launched the new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said would be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine operations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.\n\nU.S. officials said last week that the expeditionary team had captured an ISIS leader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for two or three weeks and was being questioned.\n\nThe two Iraqi officials identified the man to The Associated Press as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who worked for Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is about 50 years old, heads ISIS' recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.\n\nHe was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They would not give further details.\n\nThe officials, who both have first-hand knowledge of the individual and of the ISIS chemical program, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to brief the media.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition began targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids over the past two months, the Iraqi intelligence officials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.\n\nAirstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials said. They and the Western official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.\n\nISIS has been making a determined effort to develop chemical weapons, Iraqi and American officials have said. It is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons research, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as well as foreign experts. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the effort because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical laboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of 2014, joined with territory they controlled in neighboring Syria.\n\nStill, its progress has been limited. It is believed to have created limited amounts of mustard gas. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS was launching attacks there in August 2015. Other unverified reports in both Iraq and Syria accuse ISIS of using chemical agents on the battlefield.\n\nBut so far, experts say, the extremist group appears incapable of launching a large-scale chemical weapons attack, which requires not only expertise, but also the proper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to produce enough of the chemical agent to pose a significant threat.\n\nMore than a symbolic attack seems to me to be beyond the grasp of ISIS, said Dan Kaszeta, a former U.S. Army chemical officer and Department of Homeland Security expert who is now a private consultant. Furthermore, the chemicals we are talking about are principally chlorine and sulfur mustard, both of which are actually quite poor weapons by modern standards.\n\nThe United States has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The campaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.\n\nBut after coming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the Obama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on the ground.\n\nLast year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and captured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended as a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive about the operation. Its size is unknown, though it may be fewer than 100 troops.\n\nThis is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things, was about all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.
The Louisville Metro Police Department has formally fired two of the officers involved in the March police raid that killed emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor. Louisville mayor Greg Fischer confirmed the firings Wednesday and CBS News obtained copies of the termination letters.\n\nThe department last week sent pre-termination letters to Detective Myles Cosgrove, who an FBI analysis determined fired the shot that killed Taylor, and Detective Josh Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at Taylor's Louisville home. In the letter to Jaynes obtained by CBS News, Interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry said Jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a U.S. Postal Inspector that Taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at Taylor's home.\n\nLouisville police detectives Myles Cosgrove, left, and Joshua Jaynes, right, were involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. LMPD\n\nThe raid was linked to a drug investigation into the ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, who did not live there. Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, said police did not announce themselves before they battered in the door and he fired a shot because he feared someone was trying to break in. Three officers including Cosgrove returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were found in the home.\n\nCosgrove was fired for violating the department's deadly force policy, according to a termination letter obtained by CBS News.\n\nAnother officer who opened fire, Brett Hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment from outside. He was charged criminally with endangering Taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. No one has been charged in Taylor's death. Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said Cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, Sergeant Jon Mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by Walker.\n\nBoth Cosgrove and Jaynes will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nIn the termination letter, Gentry cited Cosgrove's statements to internal investigators in which he described seeing a distorted shadowy mass and flashes of big light. Gentry said the statements made it clear that Cosgrove did not properly identify a threat, as department policy requires, before firing 16 shots.\n\nThe shots you fired went in three different directions, indicating you did not verify a threat or have target acquisition, Gentry wrote. In other words, the evidence shows that you fired wildly at unidentified subjects or targets located within an apartment.\n\nGentry wrote that Mattingly, who was shot in the thigh by Walker, was able to identify and describe the individual whom he targeted as a threat and against whom he returned fire.\n\nGentry wrote in a Dec. 30 letter to Mattingly that he had been exonerated after an investigation into whether he violated the department's use of force and de-escalation policies.\n\nIn her letter to Cosgrove, Gentry wrote the detective failed to follow procedure when he didn't activate his body camera. Gentry said Cosgrove had attempted to explain his actions during a pre-termination meeting by referencing information about the effects an imminent threat can have on an officer's performance. But she wrote, I cannot justify your conduct or in good conscience recommend anything less than termination.\n\nBreonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker\n\nCosgrove's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.\n\nIn a termination letter to Jaynes, Gentry wrote that Jaynes did not independently confirm with a U.S. postal inspector that Glover had been receiving packages at Taylor's home, as he claimed in a search warrant affidavit he filed with a judge.\n\nI acknowledge that you believe you prepared the search warrant in good faith, Gentry wrote. However, you failed to inform the judge you had no contact with the U.S. Postal Inspector. Your sworn information was not only inaccurate, it was not truthful.\n\nThomas Clay, an attorney for Jaynes, confirmed the termination but couldn't provide more information. Last week, Clay disputed the allegations that Jaynes lied on the search warrant application.\n\nThe news of the firings came the same day the Fischer announced that Erika Shields, the former chief of the Atlanta Police Department, has been chosen as the next chief of the Louisville Metro police department. Shields will be the fourth person to lead the department since Taylor's death. She will be sworn is as chief on Jan. 19.\n\nSome in the community took to social media to decry the selection of Shields, who stepped down from her position in Atlanta after one of her officers fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, during a June arrest in a Wendy's parking lot. The officer, Garrett Rolfe, was fired and charged with counts including felony murder.\n\nFischer said Shields stepped down from her position in Atlanta so the community there could heal, and described her as a leader committed to reform. Speaking Wednesday, Shields said the Louisville department is at a crossroads and believes it can become a model for other departments across the country. The department is undergoing a review of all police practices that's expected to be complete by the end of the month, reports CBS station WLKY.\n\nI commit to begin my work here with a focus on rebuilding community trust, trust that I believe was already eroding prior to Breonna Taylor's killing, Shields said.\n\nCostanza Maio contributed reporting.
The food stamp program will be funded through February should the government shutdown continue, the Trump administration says.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is asking states to issue the February benefits on or before Jan. 20 so that they can be paid to the nearly 40 million Americans in the program. SNAP is already fully funded for January.\n\nRecipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, had been at risk of having their assistance disrupted next month because of the shutdown.\n\nThe administration announced its plans as the White House worked to limit Republican defections on spending bills in the House this week, which Democratic leaders have scheduled in hopes of driving a wedge between GOP lawmakers on the shutdown. Democrats set a vote for Thursday on the agriculture bill, which is largely made up of payments for food stamps, knowing that it would put pressure on Republicans to abandon their leaders and vote for the measure.\n\nA disruption in food stamp benefits is cause for very substantial concern, wrote Dottie Rosenbaum, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, on Monday. Many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship.\n\nThat would put more pressure on food banks and local charities to provide food and assistance to poor families, she noted. More than 250,000 supermarkets, grocery stores and other retailers that accept food stamps would see a significant drop in SNAP redemptions, which can contribute a large share of sales, she added.\n\nShort-term funding bill\n\nThe USDA said it can fund SNAP through February thanks to the short-term funding bill that ran out on Dec. 22. That bill included a provision giving federal agencies the authority to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.\n\nBrandon Lipps, an acting deputy undersecretary, said other USDA programs will also be funded through February, including school lunches, food distribution programs on Indian reservations and child nutrition programs. The latter includes WIC, which provides nutritional assistance to pregnant women, mothers and babies.\n\nUnder the provision, the SNAP program will operate as it normally does and without any lapse in service, but with an earlier deadline for states to request benefits through a process called early issuance. That process is typically used during natural disasters, Lipps said, enabling states anticipating hurricanes or other weather events to distribute monthly benefits ahead of time.\n\nLipps said the USDA is sending letters to all state agencies to explain the process and will issue a blanket waiver of department regulations to allow for the early issuance.\n\nWe know this is a time of great uncertainty, and no doubt anxiety for people who rely on SNAP and are dealing with tough times, Lipps said. I hope it's reassuring for us to make clear today that we're committed to maintaining service to SNAP clients without interruption to the extent possible under the law.\n\n$3 billion contingency fund\n\nThe SNAP program will cost roughly $4.8 billion for February, and those funds have already been appropriated through the expired spending bill. But if the shutdown lasts until March, the USDA could be forced to dip into its reserves to help fund the program, and its $3 billion SNAP contingency fund won't cover a full month of benefits.\n\nPerdue is a strong proponent of scaling back the SNAP program, and publicly supported a GOP House measure to strengthen work requirements for food stamp recipients. The measure garnered no support in the Senate and didn't make it into the final farm bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December.\n\nThe Trump administration has announced its intent to try and limit SNAP use through regulation, crafting a proposal to limit the ability of states to waive the program's work requirements.
The shortlist for Amazon's (AMZN) second headquarters is out, with the online retail giant releasing a list of the top 20 contenders on Thursday.\n\nGetting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity, Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy said in a statement. Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon said it received 238 proposals from cities and regions hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters.\n\nThe List:\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\n\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\n\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\n\n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\n\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\n\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\n\n\nMiami, Florida\n\n\n\nMontgomery County, Maryland\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\n\n\nNewark, New Jersey\n\n\n\nNew York City\n\n\n\nNorthern Virginia\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\n\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came the day after tech titan Apple (AAPL) said it will build a second corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers in a $350 billion, five-year commitment to the U.S. economy. The company has not announced a chosen city; Apple's main headquarters is in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nAmazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in September, promising to bring 50,000 new jobs and spend up to $5 billion. Proposals from cities, states and regions were due last week, and Amazon made clear that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor on where it chooses to land.\n\nThe company has said the second headquarters, dubbed HQ2, will be a full equal to its Seattle home.\n\nLeaders in Pennsylvania hailed the inclusion of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the list of finalists. Gov. Tom Wolf said he wasn't surprised, given Pennsylvania's location in the heart of the East Coast along with its nationally ranked educational institutions and a workforce equipped to support future growth.\n\nBoth Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have a real shot, and we will continue to support these locations by making the case to Amazon that Pennsylvania is a unique and tremendous place to build a business, make a home, and pursue your happiness, Wolf said.\n\nOfficials in some metro areas that didn't make the cut expressed disappointment.\n\nNew Hampshire's groundbreaking proposal to recruit Amazon was the most comprehensive business marketing plan our state has ever produced, Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. While we always knew that our bid was considered a long shot, we are excited that it is already serving as a template for other businesses that now have New Hampshire on their radar.\n\nNew Hampshire's Amazon proposal was centered in Londonderry and emphasized the state's lack of a sales or income tax.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee, Mayor Jim Strickland said the state gave it out best shot, while expressing confidence that the process will help it attract other businesses.\n\nThe city offered Amazon $60 million in cash incentives.
President-elect Joe Biden's proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage would provide an urgently pay hike to millions of low-income workers and help stem inequality in the U.S., economists and labor advocates said.\n\nIn detailing his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposal on Thursday, Mr. Biden called for raising the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, saying, No one working 40 hours a week should still be below the poverty line.\n\nA fatter paycheck could help many Americans regain their financial footing during the ongoing recovery, including essential workers such as grocery clerks and home health aides whose jobs have put them on the front lines of a pandemic yet whose earnings are among the lowest.\n\nEvery worker should be paid a $15 minimum wage, and essential front-line workers need hazard pay for the enormous health and safety risks they face during this pandemic, Marc Perrone, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. The union represents 1.3 million retail, grocery and other workers.\n\nThe incoming Biden administration's plans to hike pay also reflects a dramatically shifting political landscape — one that could finally bear fruit for low-paid workers and grassroots activists who for years have pushed for better pay and working conditions as part of the influential Fight for $15 campaign.\n\nThe labor movement's success can be seen in minimum wage hikes in 20 states this year, with another four states and Washington, D.C., also set to raise their baseline pay later this year. In Florida, meanwhile, voters in December narrowly approved a measure to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.\n\nSame federal wage since 2009\n\nThe federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, hasn't budged since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was passed in 1938. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of 2019 (the latest year for which data is available) 392,000 American workers were earning $7.25 an hour; another 1.2 million earned even less (tipped workers are among those exempt from the $7.25 minimum.)\n\nOverall, roughly 2% of all U.S. workers who are paid hourly earn $7.25 or less, government data show. Hiking the national minimum to $15 an hour by 2025 would lift 1.3 million workers above wages that put them below the poverty line, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe CBO also estimated the move would cost 1.3 million American jobs, a claim long made by conservative economists. Mr. Biden's call to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour is the absolute last thing that unemployed workers need right now, Michael Farren, an economist with the right-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said in an email. After all, they can't benefit from higher wages if those higher wages result in slower job growth.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, rejects the argument that a wage hike would lead to job losses.\n\nThat claim of job loss isn't supported by evidence — it's likely an overestimate of negative employment impact. But even if you accept their findings, they still find the benefits far outweigh the costs, Shierholz, formerly the Labor Department's chief economist under Barack Obama, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHigher labor costs from raising the minimum wage would be shouldered by businesses, some of which would pass them on to consumers, according to the CBO.\n\nThe loss in business income would be mostly borne by families well above the poverty line. All consumers would pay higher prices, but higher-income families, who spend more, would pay more of these costs, the CBO stated in a 2019 report.\n\nThere's no question that this would reduce inequality and reduce poverty by shifting money from corporate profits to low-wage workers, Shierholz said. Biden has made it very clear that his economic plans are really centering on racial justice and gender economic justice. We know women and men of color are likely to be at the low end of wage distribution.\n\nAlthough labor groups cheered Mr. Biden's push for higher wages, the proposal's political path is uncertain. Democrats could try to pass Mr. Biden's broader relief plan under budget reconciliation rules that skirt the Senate's 60-vote requirement.\n\nBut non-budget related items are prohibited from reconciliation, which means items like a minimum wage increase could not be included in a reconciliation measure, according to Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy analyst at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nDemocrats in the House are expected in coming weeks to reintroduce a version of the Raise the Wage Act that passed in the chamber two years ago, but never gained traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Tuesday it will sever all ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. The move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nThe announcement by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Boy Scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\nJoining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States. The Mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nThe Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nThe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.\n\nThe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nMore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America in a statement thanked the thousands of Mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. The organization said individual Mormons who wish to stay in Boy Scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nThe Boy Scouts' move to allow girls, announced last October, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nThe organization already has started allowing girls into the Cub Scouts. So far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled Scout Me In.\n\nThough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement had been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after former Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
A four-year college degree has long been seen as the ticket to a better life. These days, though, it may be your ticket to a job as a file clerk, at least initially.\n\nAccording a national survey by CareerBuilder, 41 percent of employers are hiring college grads for jobs that were once held largely by those with only a high school education. That figure is up from 37 percent of companies that reported doing so in a CareerBuilder survey released last year.\n\nAnd in turn, workers with bachelor's degrees have lost ground to those with greater credentials. CareerBuilder also reported that 33 percent of employers are hiring more workers with master's degrees for jobs that used to be held largely by those with bachelor's degrees, up from 27 percent in the previous survey.\n\nWhy do employers continue to raise the educational bar? Because they can.\n\nWhile the labor market has improved significantly since the Great Recession, it's still chock-full of job seekers who have college degrees but not necessarily the skills in highest demand, including science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).\n\nIn fact, CareerBuilder reported that more than half of employers that are hiring workers with college degrees to fill jobs traditionally held by high school grads said they could do so because of the current labor market.\n\nEmployers are certainly willing, in this excessive [labor] supply situation, to hire people who might appear to be overqualified, said David Passmore, a professor in the workforce education and development program at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nSaddled with high levels of student loan debt, many college grads feel they may have no choice but to take whatever job they can get. That might help to explain why wages for the college educated haven't climbed all that much during the recovery: About half of college grads earn less now than they did in 2000. Median earnings for college grads stood at $24.99 per hour in 2016, about 1.5 percent less than they earned in 2000, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\n\nThe labor market is in a funky condition, said Passmore. We have lower unemployment, but at the same time we have not had any real wage growth. Even though people are being hired, many are willing to accept a lower wage to get into the labor market, he added.\n\nOf course, CareerBuilder's findings are even more disillusioning for those with just a high school degree. Not only are they losing jobs to workers with more education, but the pay gap between college-educated workers and high school grads has never been larger. On average, college grads earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to an EPI study. That was the largest such gap in EPI's figures dating back to 1973.\n\nOn the bright side, some of the fasting-growing jobs in the U.S. require technical skills, such as computer coding, but not necessarily a four-year college degree, explained Passmore. In 2015, as many as 7 million job openings required coding skills, according to a report from analytics firm Burning Glass.\n\nPeople with high school-level skills are being hollowed out of the labor market, said Passmore. He added, If you have a high school diploma without technical skills, you will be in a long line of people waiting for jobs.
ATLANTA -- A white police officer in the greater Atlanta area who told a black driver I don't care about your people has resigned, authorities said Friday.\n\nPolice in suburban Cobb County on Friday released Officer Maurice Lawson's resignation letter, which arose from a traffic stop in November. The letter was dated a day earlier and submitted to Chief John Houser.\n\nWe accepted his resignation effective today, Houser said in a statement.\n\nLawson had recently been suspended without pay for two weeks after completing a 16-hour training class on de-escalation.\n\nAttorney Lance LoRusso said Friday Lawson believed that the current media attention and the scrutiny anticipated upon his return to duty would have proved to be an unnecessary distraction to him, and the men and women of the Cobb County Police Department, CBS affiliate WGCL reported.\n\nThe president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #13 created a GoFundMe account to raise money for Officer Lawson and his family following his suspension. Some of the donors who have given money are fellow officers, WGCL said.\n\nIn dashcam video of the Nov. 16 incident, Lawson gives motorist Brian Baker two citations. Lawson then says on video, Leave. Go away. Go to Fulton County. Atlanta is in neighboring Fulton County.\n\nLawson wrote in response to Houser's Jan. 15 memo that he said I don't care about you people, not your people. He also wrote that there was no racial motivation behind his comments, but that he had lost his temper when Baker was uncooperative during the stop.\n\nIn the video, Lawson can then be heard asking Baker whether he wants to get out of the car to talk with him. Houser wrote in the memo to Lawson that those words could be seen as an invitation for a possible altercation. Lawson then continued to engage in heated conversation with Baker, Houser wrote.\n\nAfter Baker drove off, Lawson was visibly upset, used profanities and could be saying, I lose my cool every time.\n\nAuthorities said the officer's statements raised concerns it might not have been an isolated incident and led officials to conduct random reviews of video from his other traffic stops and order a fitness for duty evaluation by a physician.\n\nHouser said that Lawson immediately recognized his behavior was contrary to policy and reported his own actions before any investigation had begun -- and before there was any media attention.\n\nLawson was given a Jan. 4 memo from the deputy police chief that proposed the two-week suspension without pay and 20-hours of verbal defense and influence training.\n\nHouser said the Department of Public Safety's Code of Conduct demands that officers show courtesy and tact and that they control their temper.\n\nWe will be reiterating the importance of courtesy and compliance with policy to our members since unbecoming conduct reflects discredit upon the individual and the Department and will not be tolerated, Houser said.\n\nLawson also had been ordered to attend 20 additional hours of training on verbal defense in March.\n\nBut Houser said In preparation for his return to active duty with a field training officer, we reviewed additional videos and additional policy issues were discovered.\n\nHouser didn't offer more details regarding the discovered policy issues.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Lawson was also involved in an incident last summer in which he followed county commissioner Lisa Cupid, which led the African American commissioner to accuse him of racial profiling. Lawson was cleared of wrong-doing in the Cupid case.\n\nMessages to lawyers of Lawson and Baker were not immediately returned.
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have wasted no time in beefing up the investigative staff dedicated to continuing the committee's work on its semi-dormant Russia probe, even as the committee's new membership is still taking shape.\n\nThe new majority has made offers to half a dozen new staffers, CBS News has learned, and is still searching for six more. Among the latest hires are an expert in corruption and illicit finance and a former prosecutor.\n\nThe committee typically does not reveal much publicly about its staff; it is withholding names and most details about potential new hires as some of them progress through a lengthy security clearance process.\n\nThere's a lot of work yet to be done on Russia, a senior committee official told CBS News. What we're doing is we are creating a purpose-built team that will take the point on that.\n\nAs they assume the majority, Democrats under newly appointed Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will add four members to the committee and more than double its staff, from 11 to roughly 24; Republicans will cut their staff count and, with some members having retired from Congress last year, likely keep their membership even at nine.\n\nAbout seven of the Democrats' new staffers will be dedicated full-time to the committee's residual work investigating alleged connections between President Trump, his campaign associates, and Russian officials – while a handful of other staffers will be available to assist in that investigation on a surge basis, committee officials say.\n\nThough Republicans on the committee declared an end to the Russia probe last spring and issued a final report finding no collusion on the part of the president's campaign, Democrats have long decried the findings as fundamentally unserious, and vowed to keep parts of the inquiry open.\n\nSchiff said in an interview last month that the committee had been deluged with résumés from candidates hoping to join its staff.\n\nThe new staff additions are intended to enhance the committee's ability to make inroads on unanswered questions in the Russia investigation without requiring it to pivot away from the day job of overseeing the intelligence community's 17 organizations, according to committee officials. But the final team will likely bring with it the investigative and prosecutorial specialties Schiff has long sought.\n\nAs ranking member, the California Democrat consistently lamented being hamstrung by a Republican majority which, under then-Chairman Devin Nunes, D-Calif., seemed at best incurious about certain aspects of the Trump-Russia nexus. Schiff has also been publicly wistful about the special counsel's investigative horsepower, telling an audience at the Council of Foreign Relations last February that he was deeply jealous of the team Mueller had assembled.\n\nI have a phenomenal staff, he said at the time, They're bright and they work 24/7, seven days a week and they do it with no windows.\n\n[B]ut they're largely analysts, Schiff continued, they're not trained to be investigators.\n\nThe team now tasked with resuscitating the Russia investigation is not expected to start from scratch, but instead to zero in on some complex financial and legal questions whose answers have largely eluded House investigators.\n\nUnlike in the last Congress, when the investigation was undertaken by existing oversight staff, Chairman Schiff will now have a team better able to answer the key questions about Trump's relationship with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his cronies, the senior committee official said.\n\nSchiff and some of his fellow committee Democrats have been transparent about what some of their immediate priorities will be. They include the release to the special counsel -- and subsequently to the public -- of all of the committee's Russia investigation interview transcripts; subpoenaing relevant banking and telecommunications records that Democrats have said contain information that implicates the president; and hearing – in some cases a second time – from key witnesses.\n\nAmong the witnesses in which the Democrats have expressed an interest are the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, family members like Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, and other former Trump campaign officials, like George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, who have cooperated with the special counsel.\n\nDemocrats have also telegraphed a voracious appetite for new avenues of inquiry, including the Trump Organization's reported offer of a $50 million condo in Trump Tower Moscow to Putin and the notes taken by the interpreter present at the two leaders' one-on-one meeting last July.\n\nWhile Schiff has also previously mentioned the potential for coordination between his committee and that of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose own investigation will enter its second year later this month, aides from both indicated the change in leadership would not necessarily pave the way for collaboration, and that the two investigations will remain separate.\n\nAs these new priorities come to the fore, Schiff has also vowed restore both comity and sobriety to the committee – though there are no indications that he and Nunes, who will now serve as ranking member, have reestablished lines of communication, let alone decided on an amicable path forward.\n\nIn fact, Republicans on the committee are generally skeptical that the majority, under Schiff, will make a concerted effort to resume normal oversight work as long as the Russia investigation remains a chief focus.\n\nA Republican committee official said Democrats were adopting a posture of Show me the man and I'll show you the crime vis-a-vis President Trump – an apparent reference to the ruthless and manipulative tactics of the former head of the Soviet secret police under Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn a statement, the spokesman for the committee's Republican minority, Jack Langer, said, For months, the committee's Democrats have shown that their principal priority is to launch a sprawling investigation of Trump and to try to manufacture a basis for impeachment.\n\nSo Republicans will focus on doing the oversight of the Intelligence Community that this committee was created to do, and will be pointing out the absurdity of the Democrats' myriad conspiracy theories, Langer said.\n\nRestructuring\n\nThe day-to-day work of oversight is also evolving with the Democrats taking the reins.\n\nWhile parts of the committee's operations and structure are virtually always tweaked by the incoming majority – Nunes, as chairman, put in place a mostly agency-specific subcommittee structure, with groups dedicated to the CIA, NSA and defense intelligence in particular – under Schiff, the four existing subcommittees will also be reorganized.\n\nRather than keeping the subcommittees focused on specific agencies, they will be restructured around thematic challenges – or core missions – across the intelligence community, according to officials familiar with the committee's plans.\n\nOne subcommittee will focus on crucial and increasingly competitive technologies at the heart of the intelligence enterprise, including satellites and other space-based assets, advanced and quantum computing, and challenges like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nA second will oversee the intelligence community's counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts – including those in hotspots like North Korea and Iran – as well as counterintelligence. The third will look at the overall management of the intelligence community, with an emphasis on human capital management, information technology, and security clearance reform. The last will focus on intelligence community's support to the American military and the Pentagon.\n\n[T]hese subcommittees will be empowered to devise and execute their own oversight plans through hearings, deep dives, and travel to [intelligence community] elements at home and abroad, Schiff said in a statement provided to CBS News.\n\nIt sounds to me like a sensible division of labor over four subcommittees and I don't think the agencies will feel like they're overlooked, said Michael Allen, a former majority staff director under Republican chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich.\n\nThe technologies subcommittee in particular makes a lot of sense, said Allen, who also served on former president George W. Bush's national security council. That topic – especially as China continues stealing critical technology – remains a major concern in the national security community.\n\nMark Lowenthal, who also served as staff director to former Republican chairman Larry Combest, agreed. This array is more likely to lead to effective oversight, he said. While there are agency-specific problems, a lot of issues that you worry about – whether you are managing or overseeing – transcend the intelligence agencies, across the board.\n\nLowenthal, who also served in policy and management roles in the executive branch as vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council and as an assistant director of central intelligence, said the new structure will likely provide the committee with more visibility into the intelligence community's most urgent challenges.\n\nOne of the things people always complain about in the intelligence community is 'stovepipes,' he said. Well, if you set up committees on an agency basis you replicate those stovepipes.\n\nThis seems a much better way to get a sense of what's going on and where Congress can help figure out what needs doing, Lowenthal said.\n\nThe committee, once it is fully constituted, will still need to vote in order to finalize the new structure and assign new subcommittee chairs.\n\nFrom there, other business items, both regular and extraordinary, and ranging from the release of dozens of witness transcripts, to the issuance of subpoenas, to standard open hearings, are expected to be put in motion later this month or in early February.\n\nIt is unclear if Nunes, who for a time stepped away from the committee's Russia investigation amid an ethics investigation, will participate in the committee's witness interviews, once they recommence.
The following is a transcript of the interview with former special presidential envoy Brett McGurk that aired Sunday, Jan. 20, 2019, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to now welcome Brett McGurk. He was President Trump's envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, but he resigned last month in protest following the president's decision to withdraw from Syria. In an op-ed this week, he warned America's decision to pull out is giving the terror group new life. Brett, thank you for being here.\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Thanks for having me Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The vice president sat here and reiterated that ISIS is defeated. Is he correct?\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Well they're not defeated. I've been- I've been part of this campaign for four years across two administrations. We've come a- an extraordinarily long way. And in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million Syrians and Iraqis. It was committing genocide against Christians and Yazidis and minority groups. It was planning attacks against us in the homeland. It was carrying them out in Paris, that killed Americans in Brussels and Paris. We've come a long way. We have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS. What that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. And what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. So as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in Syria for some time. And on instructions from the White House, we were telling them, we'd stay in Syria until we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS, not just the physical territory. We'd stay in Syria until the Iranians left Syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in Geneva to end the ultimate civil war. We had told that to our partners on the ground. We had told that to our coalition partners and it was reversed in a conversation between the president and a foreign leader. Leadership- American leadership really counts. Leadership built this coalition. It led to these gains against ISIS. And leadership requires some presence on the ground and also consistency. And it was the total reversal of our policy that made it- I just I concluded I could not be effective in carrying out those new instructions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We should point out, you joined the State Department under President Bush. You then served under President Obama and then under President Trump. Can you clarify there, I point that out because you serve Democrats and Republicans. Why did you resign specifically?\n\nMCGURK: Well again look I- look--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President has alleged it's political.\n\nMCGURK: Well I've- I've served all three administrations. I've worked on policies that I fully supported. You work on policies here in the government that you might not support. You argue your case. In this case, I think the entire national security team had one view, and the president in a conversation with President Erdoğan just completely reversed the policy. You know the president has said, I think he's right, you never- you never telegraph a punch when you're in a military campaign. You also don't telegraph your retreat. I've probably traveled to Syria more than any other American civilian official. I know our people in Syria. I- my heart is broken and we're all- our thoughts are with the families and loved ones that were just killed. In this campaign in Syria since 2015, we've had two Americans killed in action. We built this campaign plan, to answer for those who believe that we should not be over invested in these confl- conflicts. Americans are not fighting. We built a force of 60,000 Syrians to do the fighting. American taxpayers are not spending money on civilian stabilization or reconstruction costs. The coalition is doing that. So it was a sustainable campaign plan and we had in- the pieces in place, as we defeat the physical caliphate, to begin a very serious negotiation with some pretty hostile actors in Syria, including Russia. And we had worked with the Russians diplomatically basically to draw lines on the map at the Euphrates River and we said, Look you don't cross that river. If you cross that river we'll kill you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we- have we have a map we can put up just so people understand that what you're saying is- is actually having a real world impact on the ground what President Trump did. And possibly lose the territory that the U.S. has cleared out?\n\nMCGURK: Well the minute you say- the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations. And we have to work things out in Syria with Russia, and our presence on the ground matters. And the two to three thousand Americans we have on the ground are not just any American soldiers. They are our most elite, most highly trained forces. Again I visited them from the beginning of the campaign- I was one of the first civilians on the ground way back in the battle of Kobanî. They have done an incredible job. It is those forces that allow the force of the Syrian Democratic Forces with 60,000 Syrians that we have helped build and enable, they allow that force to be effective. If you simply pull out American forces without a plan for what comes next, it is going to open up a signif- significant vacuum. I know the vice- vice president said we're gonna look for coalition partners to take our place. As the former leader of the coalition, I just don't think that that is credible. I know what it takes in these coalition capitals for them to put their blood and treasure on the line with us. It takes American leadership and takes American presence. And we've just told the world that we're no longer going to be present. So it'll have a dramatic ramification. And that's why, what I wrote in the Washington Post, I think we have to really accept some hard truths. I think number one we are leaving. The president has made that clear- we are leaving. And that means our force should be really with one mission: to get out and get out safely. We cannot add additional missions onto our force while they are trying to withdraw under pressure, because withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And I think what you're sketching out here is- to put it plainly- how we withdraw. Accept that the president's mind- mind is made up. But one of the issues you have here is that the way the president is doing this puts forces at risk and puts the gains at risk. Am I hearing you correctly?\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Announcing you're going to withdraw, and without a plan, and believe me there's no plan for what's coming next. Right now we do not have a plan. It increases a vulnerability of our force. It increases the environment on the ground in Syria. This environment in northeast Syria has been fairly permissive and safe. Again, I've been there almost 20 times and we have been- been very careful with this. It is increasing the risk to our people on the ground in Syria and will open up space for ISIS. But what's most important is we cannot expect a partner such as Turkey to come in and take our place, or another coalition partner to take our place. That is not realistic. And if our forces are under order to withdraw, as at the same time they are trying to find some formula for another coalition partner to come in, that is not workable. That is not a viable plan.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So when the secretary of state says the U.S. military can strike ISIS or any threat in Syria from anywhere, you're saying that's not actually the case? Being on the ground matters.\n\nMCGURK: Well having a presence on the ground is a critical force multiplier that has allowed us to defeat ISIS as a physical- physical space. To give us the intelligence to keep pressure on them and pulling out all of those forces will have very significant repercussions which we need to be ready for.
WASHINGTON -- A joint-NPR/WAMU report published in late November exposed a culture of grade changing to boost graduation rates at a high school in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, the findings of an audit essentially backed the reported claims, CBS affiliate WUSA reports.\n\nAlvarez and Marsal, a law firm, found that 63.8 percent -- or 113 -- of 177 students who graduated from Frank W. Ballou Senior High School last school year graduated with the assistance of policy violations, which were identified as actions such as awarding a student a 50 percent on assignments they did not finish or may have missed. In total, those students benefited from 222 violations, according to the law firm, WUSA reports.\n\nBallou administrators communicated high passing percentage expectations to teachers, reads the report, which says the school's principal and assistant principals were involved. These expectations were communicated directly to teachers from the Principal to the Assistant Principals in person, via staff meetings, and via email, and were formalized in the Ballou IMPACT rubric.\n\nThe audit was ordered after the report published in November found that more than 50 percent of Ballou's 2017 graduating class passed despite extensive absences.\n\nThe findings of the audit were discussed Tuesday at a City Hall news conference, where Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters, We rolled out a policy in the 2015-2016 school year intended to raise the bar in our school district (academically) and ensure students were set-up for success.\n\nBut we've never really put in place the training controls or accountability to support it, the mayor said.\n\nWe should've done a better job, Bowser added.
If you've dropped and cracked your iPhone and are looking to exchange it for a newer model, you will probably like the latest retail initiatives from Apple. The company is reportedly launching a more generous iPhone trade-in program at Apple Stores, as well as in-store installations of iPhone screen protectors, the tech site 9to5Mac reports.\n\nRight now, the company's Reuse and Recycle iPhone trade-in program gives customers the chance to trade in older phones for credit toward buying a newer iPhone model. The catch? If these older phones have cracked displays or broken cameras or buttons, they aren't eligible to receive credit. With the new policy, credit will be given for iPhone 5s, 6, and 6 Plus phones that are damaged within reason. The main objective of this, of course, is to encourage phone upgrades rather than just getting a screen repair.\n\nSources told 9to5 Mac that the current trade-in prices for this new program would be $50 for an iPhone 5s, $200 for a 6, and $250 for a 6 Plus.\n\nBeyond the trade-in program, Apple Stores will start installing plastic iPhone screen protectors over the course of the next few weeks. Right now, this is rolling out in a few select stores starting Friday.\n\nWhy wasn't this offered in stores before? Apple Stores were instructed to avoid screen installations over concerns that putting third-party products on iPhones might result in error. For this new program, if the machine install results in error, Apple will give customers free protector replacements and try the installation again.
Beijing — China's economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on Beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with Washington.\n\nGrowth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017's 6.9 percent as both the world's appetite for China's exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed Monday.\n\nForecasters said they expect Beijing to try to shore up growth by making credit cheaper, raising government spending and adopting measures to encourage sales of autos and consumer goods.\n\nCommunist leaders want to steer China toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to boost spending on construction of roads and bridges and to order banks to lend more, especially to the entrepreneurs who generate most of China's new jobs and wealth.\n\nDownward pressure on the economy is increasing, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, Ning Jizhe, said at a news conference. He cited import controls, volatile financial markets and declining investment spending as factors.\n\nStill, Ning insisted China can resist shocks, saying the long-term trend of stability will not change.\n\nSlowest growth since 1990\n\nEconomic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990's 3.9 percent following the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\n\nGrowth in the last quarter of 2018 dipped to 6.4 percent — the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis — from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent.\n\nThe government is expected to implement more fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support economic growth, Yanjun Lin of IHS Markit said in a report.\n\nGrowth in investment, retail spending and factory activity all declined, though analysts pointed to a flicker of improvement in manufacturing in December. It grew by 5.7 percent over a year earlier, up 0.3 percentage points from November.\n\nProduction of plastics, metals and specialized industrial machinery accelerated, suggesting warming expectations for a pick-up in investment, Chaoping Zhu of J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report.\n\nTrade war taking a toll\n\nThe trade dispute with the U.S. is proving costly. Exports held up through most of 2018 despite President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions. But they contracted in December as the penalties began to depress U.S. demand.\n\nThe two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 percent on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Washington wants China to roll back plans for state-led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nThe trade dispute, and reports of job losses and tumbling sales of autos and real estate, have unnerved Chinese consumers that Beijing is counting on to drive growth. As pocketbooks snap shut, the downturn could worsen.\n\nChina's top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, is due to visit Washington for talks Jan. 30-31.\n\nBusiness groups and economists said a decision by Liu and his American counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower-level officials made progress.\n\nTrump said Saturday that trade relations with China were going very well and a deal could very well happen.\n\nBeijing hits the gas\n\nForecasters expect Chinese growth to bottom out this year as Beijing's stimulus efforts gain traction. However, they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports.\n\nPublic works spending is shaping up to be the engine for 2019, Iris Pang of ING said in a report. However, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. And debt will grow.\n\nA meeting of Communist Party leaders in December promised tax cuts, better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector.\n\nChinese leaders have been warning that any recovery would be L-shaped, meaning that companies and investors shouldn't expect growth to rebound to the previous decade's double-digit levels.\n\nForecasters expect growth to decline further this year to 6.3 percent or lower.\n\nChina's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilizes in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.
New research finds tobacco products are being marketed and sold through unpaid content on Facebook despite policies from the social media company restricting or prohibiting the promotion of these items. In many of these instances, there is no safeguard in place to prevent access to minors.\n\nFacebook has a portfolio of policies with the laudable intent of keeping tobacco promotion and sales out of the Facebook platform, lead study author Robert Jackler, M.D., principal investigator of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising, told CBS News. These policies are voluntary, and they're a sign of Facebook's commitment to social responsibility. Unfortunately, these policies are inconsistently enforced and a large volume of tobacco promotion exists on Facebook.\n\nFacebook bars paid tobacco advertisements, including ads for cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobaccos, tobacco pipes, hookahs, hookah lounges, rolling papers, vaporized delivery devices and electronic cigarettes. According to its advertising policy, images of tobacco and related products, as well as links to sites where such items can be purchased, are not permitted.\n\nThe social media giant does allow blogs or groups connecting people with tobacco-related interests, as long as they're not selling tobacco or tobacco-related products. But it has an array of rules in place that apply to sales and commercial activity.\n\nFacebook\n\nHowever, new research from the Stanford University School of Medicine finds many tobacco companies are getting around these restrictions through unpaid or organic posts, mainly on their brand-sponsored Facebook pages.\n\nOut of 108 company-sponsored Facebook pages for leading brands of cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco and smokeless tobacco, the study authors found more than half included purchase links, such as a shop now-type button. Roughly two-thirds of the pages offered sales promotions, including coupons and discounts. All but one featured images of tobacco products.\n\nWhile none of the 21 top traditional cigarette brands had Facebook pages, the study found 10 of 14 online tobacco stores with company-maintained pages promoted popular cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, Camel, Newport, and American Spirit, and included links to purchase them. The results of the study are published online in The BMJ Tobacco Control.\n\nFacebook has what it calls an age-gate requirement for the private sale of regulated goods, including tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. This means anyone under the age of 18 should not be able to access pages promoting the private sale of these items. Facebook notes that the age restriction applies only to private individuals selling items peer-to-peer, not licensed retailers.\n\nThe researchers found only 48 out of the 108 tobacco brand-sponsored Facebook pages had a safeguard in place to restrict access to minors.\n\nThis is important, Jackler says, because younger people are more likely to begin using tobacco, with the risk of becoming addicted to nicotine.\n\nAs the vast majority of smoking initiation occurs during teen years, the tobacco industry has a long history of targeting adolescents, he said. If you want to reach teens in 2018, the place to do it is via social media, especially Facebook, because such a high fraction of youth use it on a daily basis. \n\nRecent figures show 5.8 million U.S. teens aged 13-17 use Facebook, and 65 percent of them say they check it every day. The social network has over 2 billion users worldwide.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the number of likes for each company-sponsored Facebook page. At the time of the study, 30 of the pages had accumulated 10,000 or more likes, with four of the pages having more than 50,000 likes.\n\nJackler said he and his team were not surprised that tobacco companies found ways around Facebook's restrictions to promote the sale of their products.\n\nWhat did surprise us was the volume and variety of unpaid tobacco promotion we encountered on Facebook and the passivity of Facebook in sustaining its own policies, he said. While Facebook was vigilant in excluding paid tobacco advertisements, which appear to receive special scrutiny, it seems to have no systematic monitoring of tobacco brand sponsored promotion on its pages.\n\nFacebook took issue with some aspects of the study, for example noting that its commerce policies only apply to the Shop Section of a company's page, while the researchers considered a broader array of posts.\n\nIn a statement provided to CBS News, Facebook said:\n\nSelling or advertising tobacco products is not allowed on Facebook. We use a combination of technology, human review and reports from our community to find and remove any content that violates these policies, and provide tools that make it easy for our community to report content they think may violate. Our enforcement is not perfect, but we continue to find ways to strengthen our review and enforcement of our policies.\n\nHowever, Jackler says the issue is not principally with Facebook, but with the tobacco companies.\n\nIt is primarily focused upon exposing yet another example of the cynical way the tobacco industry circumvents any and all attempts to constrain its never ceasing efforts to promote its products, Jackler said.\n\nHe said ultimately, the study exposes loopholes within Facebook that the social network has the opportunity to close.\n\nOur hope is that our study, by highlighting the degree to which tobacco marketers evade their intended restrictions, will encourage Facebook to make a renewed effort to implement their well-intentioned policies, Jackler said.
COLUMBIA, Mo. - Missouri quarterback Maty Mauk has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nAthletic director Mack Rhodes and coach Barry Odom announced the punishment on Monday night after a brief video was posted to Twitter. It shows a person appearing to snort a white, powder-like substance and the accompanying tweet mentions Mauk by name, but there was no confirmation from Missouri that the video shows the quarterback.\n\nRhodes and Odom say in their joint statement they are gathering information regarding the video in question. They say they will take appropriate action once they have all the facts.\n\nIt is Mauk's third suspension in the last four months. He was suspended in September for an undisclosed violation of team policy and again in November for unspecified disciplinary reasons.
DALLAS - Soon Delta Air Lines will require additional documentation for passengers taking service animals with them on flights. This comes amid an increase of incidents involving animals, including a dog attack last year.\n\nStarting March 1, customers will have to show proof of health or vaccinations for their animals 48 hours in advance. In addition, owners of emotional-support animals will need to sign a statement confirming their animal can behave. However, the new requirements don't apply to pets that stay in kennels during flights.\n\nDelta's new rules are aimed at two different types of animals. The first are service animals, which receive specific training to help blind or disabled passengers. Then there are emotional-support animals, which require no training at all. Both fly for free and are not required to be caged during the flight.\n\nFederal regulators have interpreted a 1986 access-to-travel law to allow support animals in airplane cabins and in apartment buildings that do not allow pets. But some people use untrained pets in order to get them on a plane for free, especially since it's easy to go online to buy vests or ID card with a service animal insignia.\n\nDelta said the idea behind the new regulations is to keep trained service animals and emotional-support animals safe from aggressive ones. Overall, the airline says it carries 700 service or support animals every day. But people have tried to fly with everything from turkeys, to snakes, spiders and even gliding possums, which are also known as sugar gliders.\n\nSince 2016, the company reported an 86-percent increase in 'animal incidents', that include animals urinating, biting or showing acts of aggression. Last June, a 70-pound dog flying as a support animal bit another passenger several times in the face on a Delta plane in Atlanta. The victim was hospitalized.\n\nAccording to CBS News correspondent Don Dahler, Tom Panek, CEO of Guiding Eyes for the Blind, was on a Delta flight recently, made miserable by a misbehaving support dog.\n\nFor two and a half hours, passengers had to tolerate this dog while it was barking, lunging and disrupting the flight, Panek said. No one wanted to confront this individual and say that that dog is not appropriate as an emotional support dog.\n\nIt might seem like a harmless way to travel with your pet, but Panek says there are serious repercussions.\n\nIt profoundly affects us because the next time that we go into a restaurant, they may tell me, 'no, you don't have access here', and I wouldn't be able to take three steps without Gus.\n\nNineteen states have laws against calling untrained dogs, service dogs. Arizona is considering legislation to become the twentieth.
The economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in many respects, but all too familiar in one: The crisis has taken a particular toll on young workers.\n\nAs unemployment around the U.S. was peaking this spring, more than a quarter of young Americans lost their jobs. Most of the country's youngest workers have either lost a job or taken a pay cut during the crash, according to Pew Research — and perhaps not surprisingly, they are also the most likely to report having trouble paying their bills or rent.\n\nYounger people who still have jobs are least likely to have the option of telecommuting, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), losing out on a large added measure of protection from the virus, not to mention the cost savings of not having to commute. They're also most likely to have relocated due to the pandemic: For the first time since the 1930s, more young adults in the U.S. are living with parents than not, according to Pew data.\n\nNot only have many young people in this country faced the harsh reality of returning to school without in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, the job prospects for those seeking employment have been particularly bleak, economists at the left-leaning EPI said in a recent report.\n\nYoung workers were among those hit hardest by the coronavirus shutdown this spring. The unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds peaked at 27% in April, according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of November, unemployment among the youngest workers was twice as high as among other employees.\n\nFirst jobs vaporized\n\nThe pandemic has shuttered many of the service industries that have historically employed young people: restaurants, bars, coffee shops and retail stores.\n\nLast year, one in four young workers had a job in the leisure and hospitality sector — an industry that lost 3.3 million jobs in 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Another one-fifth of young workers were in the retail sector, which is down 680,000 jobs since the spring.\n\nThis crisis has delayed that very first step into the labor force, said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. It's that first experience of making money — it may have been an office internship, or a cashier in a book store, or restaurant job over summer.\n\nCole Stevens, who graduated from high school this spring, has been working since he was 14 to help with his family's expenses. In April, the Minneapolis-area coffee shop where Stevens worked part-time closed, putting him and other high school students out of work.\n\nIt was all high school students that work there. And we lost that business, all of those students were out of a job, Stevens said at a recent roundtable discussion with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. After a legal battle, he was able to collect unemployment benefits.\n\n\n\nMy family never had a lot of money, so I learned the value of family and the value of the dollar when I was young, Stevens told CBS Minnesota. He has long wanted to start his own business, but working to support himself has delayed those plans, Stevens told Walz at the roundtable event.\n\nFailure to launch\n\nDelayed entry into the workforce is becoming far more common for American teenagers, whose rates of working have plummeted since the 1990s, according to data from the Census Bureau, the Labor Department and the Federal Reserve. However, the unprecedented breadth of the pandemic, which has permanently closed more than 100,000 restaurants and thousands more small businesses, raises questions about how much work there will be once the virus abates.\n\nMeanwhile, those young people lucky enough to find a first job in these times can look forward to a lifetime of lower earnings, thanks to having entered the job market during a recession. Decades of research show that college graduates who start work during recessions earn, on average, less than their peers from other generations for up to 20 years, and in some cases for their entire working lives.\n\n\n\nBecause of their initial bad start, they often get stuck in low-paying, low-quality jobs. Even when the economy gets stronger, it can be difficult for these workers to catch up to their pre-recession cohorts, EPI said.\n\nDouble whammy for millennials\n\nIndeed, research on millennials, the generation that entered the job market during the Great Recession and whose oldest members will turn 40 this year, shows that the dismal economy had weighed on their ability to earn and keep money.\n\nThey've really gotten hit twice — the Great Recession and now, again, a crisis. That's going to impact lifetime earnings, said Konkel.\n\nI feel like I've regressed to my teenage years: I'm in my childhood home, in my childhood bedroom. I have chores again, 30-year-old Eric Rivera told CBS This Morning. He moved from his apartment in Brooklyn, New York, to his parents' home in New Jersey after losing his job during the pandemic.\n\nYou kind of start spiraling: Am I ever going to move out of this house? Rivera said. I'm still hopeful about finding a job and moving out on my own again, but that timeline's a moving target.\n\n\n\nMillennials, as a group, are earning less than their parents. They have far less wealth and more debt than baby boomers did at the same age. Today, just 5% of national wealth is held by the millennial generation. Boomers, at the same age, held more than double that.\n\nIn personal finance lore, the 30s are a time to build up a savings cushion, pay into your retirement fund and perhaps buy a home. But, Konkel said, millennials already didn't have a good cushion to start with, because of the Great Recession.\n\nThe current crisis will further exacerbate those decisions: When to get married, whether to have kids, how many kids to have, because kids are expensive, Konkel said. Indeed, Brookings researchers have warned America to expect a baby bust next year, with 300,000 fewer births happening than would normally be expected.\n\nMeanwhile, many millennials who are parents are finding their work and family in conflict — and are being pushed away from work. One in five working parents isn't working in order to take care of their children, the Census Bureau found this summer.\n\nThat burden largely falls on women, two million of whom have dropped out of the workforce this year, a reality reflected in the labor participation rates for men and women of parenting age. After losing jobs earlier this year, men are rejoining the labor force — but women aren't.\n\nWe're just seeing so many women leaving the labor force, and there are concerns about will they come back? said Konkel. Have we lost the last 20 years of progress?\n\nShe added, If they don't come back, we are not going to return to where we were in the pre-COVID era. We're not going to get back a full, robust recovery.
Updated at 3:17 p.m. ET\n\nSenate and House leaders announced Friday they are postponing work on two controversial anti-piracy bills in the wake of large online protests that spurred several congressmen to rethink the legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced today that he is postponing Tuesday's procedural vote on the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith said his committee is postponing consideration of PIPA's House companion, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), until there is wider agreement on a solution.\n\nPIPA and SOPA are intended to strengthen protections against copyright infringement and intellectual property theft, but Internet advocates say they would stifle expression on the World Wide Web. CBS Corporation is among the media and entertainment companies that support the legislation.\n\nIn protest of the legislation, major sites like Wikipedia and Reddit participated in a 24-hour Internet blackout on Wednesday, while other sites like Google took less drastic steps to signify their opposition to the legislation. The protests inspired voters to deluge their congressmen with phone calls and emails in protest of the bills as well, and by Wednesday afternoon, several congressmen either came out in opposition to the bills or said Congress should take more time to reconsider them. It seemed unlikely PIPA would find the 60 votes necessary to pass Tuesday's test vote in the Senate.\n\nAdam Green, co-founder of the grassroots group Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said the legislation's delay shows that people power works. His organization helped about 43,000 people call their congressmen in opposition to the bill.\n\nSOPA, PIPA: What you need to know\n\nSOPA, PIPA protests spur Congress to rethink bills\n\nSOPA and PIPA Internet blackout aftermath, staggering numbers\n\nReid said in a statement, There is no reason that the legitimate issues raised by many about this bill cannot be resolved. He encouraged PIPA's author, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to continue working with stakeholders on the bill to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the Internet.\n\nReid said the Senate had made good progress through its discussions on the bill in recent weeks and that he's optimistic that the Senate can reach a compromise. He stressed that counterfeiting and piracy are serious problems that hurt major industries, including the movie industry, which supports 2.2 million jobs alone.\n\nWe must take action to stop these illegal practices, he said. We live in a country where people rightfully expect to be fairly compensated for a day's work, whether that person is a miner in the high desert of Nevada, an independent band in New York City, or a union worker on the back lots of a California movie studio.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee was slated to take up SOPA again in February, but Smith issued a statement after Reid's PIPA announcement, noting that he also has heard from critics of the bills.\n\nI take seriously their concerns regarding proposed legislation to address the problem of online piracy, he said. It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell American inventions and products.\n\nSmith said the problem of online piracy is too big to ignore and that the House Judiciary Committee will continue to work with both copyright owners and Internet companies to find the right solution.\n\nIn his own statement, Leahy criticized the senators who walked back their support for PIPA, compelling Reid to postpone the procedural vote, which would have officially started a Senate floor debate on the bill.\n\nThe day will come when the Senators who forced this move will look back and realize they made a knee-jerk reaction to a monumental problem, Leay said. Somewhere in China today, in Russia today, and in many other countries that do not respect American intellectual property, criminals who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen American content are smugly watching how the United States Senate decided it was not even worth debating how to stop the overseas criminals from draining our economy.\n\nOpponents of SOPA and PIPA object to the bill in part because they argue it would impose a huge, unmanageable burden on Internet companies to police their sites for connections to copyright or intellectual property infringers. Start ups in particular would not be able to handle the legal costs involved, and it could quash innovation in the Internet industry.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Friday he was encouraged by Reid's decision to postpone the vote.\n\nWe all agree that we must do more to combat the on-line theft of intellectual property, McConnell said in a statement, but he said PIPA raised serious legal, policy and operational concerns.\n\nRepublican Rep. Darrell Issa of California and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon co-authored a bill intended to serve as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA -- the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act.\n\nFor all those who might have thought that their voice didn't count in their government, I hope you now know it does, Wyden tweeted after Reid postponed the PIPA vote.\n\nIssa said in a statement that postponing the PIPA vote removes the imminent threat to the Internet, but it's not over yet. Copyright infringement remains a serious problem and any solution must be targeted, effective, and consistent with how the Internet works.\n\nComputer & Communications Industry Association President Ed Black said in a statement that Those who value and appreciate the Internet can breathe a little easier today.\n\nWe recognize that the dynamic quality of the Internet can be disruptive to established entities and practices, whether they be governments, companies, or individuals, Black said. When legitimate interests and problems result, we remain prepared to address those problems in ways that don't damage the core principles on which the Internet depends.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry @JohnKerry\n\n@JohnKerry Secretary of Defense Mark Esper @EsperDoD\n\n@EsperDoD Senator Tim Kaine, D-Virgina, @TimKaine\n\nD-Virgina, @TimKaine Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, @SenMikeLee\n\nR-Utah, @SenMikeLee Representative Adam Schiff, D-California @RepAdamSchiff\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, the critical standoff between the U.S. and Iran deescalates, but the conflict takes a tragic turn and now there's a new crisis, as Iran admits to erroneously shooting down a passenger aircraft killing a hundred and seventy-six. We'll have the latest.\n\nAnd here in the U.S. some in Congress are demanding answers as to why the administration continues to send mixed messages about the, quote, imminent threat used to justify the strike in the first place.\n\nOn Saturday, the Iranian government acknowledged what they've been denying for days, that following retaliatory missile strikes on U.S. installations in Iraq--they'd unintentionally shot down Ukrainian passenger jet mistaking it for an incoming missile. A high-ranking Iranian official was quick to point to U.S. provocation as partially to blame. Now Iranians are angry with their own government and the U.S.\n\nAs Washington and Baghdad remain at an impasse over the role of U.S. forces in Iraq, we'll talk to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll also ask him about the intelligence behind the killing of Soleimani. The administration's handling of the crisis is causing frustration even among some Republicans loyal to the President.\n\nMIKE LEE: Now, I find this insulting and demeaning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Mike Lee, Democrats Tim Kaine and Adam Schiff will all be here. Plus, former Secretary of State John Kerry weighs in on Iran and why he's supporting Joe Biden.\n\nAnd a special behind-the-scenes report from our Liz Palmer, she and her team spent a tumultuous week in Iran.\n\nAll that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with the secretary of defense, Mark Esper. Good morning to you, Mister Secretary. Good to have you here.\n\nMARK ESPER (Secretary of Defense/@EsperDoD): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Our team in Tehran witnessed anti-government protests, chants against the regime. What is the U.S. assessment of what's happening on the ground?\n\nMARK ESPER: We are safer today than we were just a few weeks ago. Why? Because we took out the world's foremost terrorist leader, Qasem Soleimani, who had the blood of hundreds of American dead service members on his hands. Secondly, we restored deterrence with Iran without any United States casualties. And, third, we reassured our partners-- partners and allies in the region that we will stand up and defend our interests. I think when you look at--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of restoring deterrence, there wasn't an-- Iran fired off missiles at the United States' bases, so.\n\nMARK ESPER: We-- we are confident we restored deterrence. And if you look to your question--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't expect any further attacks on U.S. presence?\n\nMARK ESPER: We do not expect any further attacks. But if you look at what's happening on the ground today, you have just yesterday in Tehran and other cities, Iranians chanting, Death to the Ayatollah. We don't-- we don't think America is our enemy. You can see the-- the Iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights, their aspirations for a better government, a different-- a different regime.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what is the assessment, though, of-- of what level of threat there is to the regime's hold on power? Because the President was tweeting yesterday in Farsi messages that he stands with the protesters and he's following closely what's happening.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, we do stand with the Iranian people. They want the same things that most people around the world want. They want prosperity. They want the ability to-- to live their lives, to raise their children. And we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. I just think you see a very corrupt regime that the Iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So is there still an offer to negotiate with that regime you call corrupt? Because by saying you stand with the protesters, it seems to be in contradiction to an offer to negotiate with the government they're protesting against.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it is still the legitimate government, if you will, of Iran. And what we've said, I've said publicly, the President certainly has said, is we will meet with them. We're willing to sit down and discuss without precondition, a new way forward, a-- a-- a series of steps by which Iran becomes a more normal country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's-- offer still stands?\n\nMARK ESPER: That offer still stands.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if something happens to these protesters in the street, I mean is there a line that the President won't meet with Iran?\n\nMARK ESPER: The President has drawn no preconditions other than to say we're willing to meet with the Iranian government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I want to ask you about the downing of this Ukrainian commercial airliner. The Iranian foreign minister tweeted, admitted it was a mistake on their behalf, but also said, essentially, the U.S. contributed because of the escalation. What's your response to that?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, first of all, it's a terrible tragedy. A hundred and seventy-six people from many nations killed. It's a shame that the first reaction of the Iranian government to show their corruption, wanted to say that it was American propaganda, when, clearly, it was just a horrible mistake. To somehow allow Iran to play the victim card with the international community is just ridiculous. These tensions started many years ago, twenty years ago, forty years ago, and escalated in the past twelve months, led by the terrorist leader, Qasem Soleimani, who is escalating attacks against United States forces in the region, in Baghdad in particular, which ultimately led to the siege of the United States embassy there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that attempt to breach the perimeter and the embassy. But also, broadly, the threat that the U.S. was tracking that has been described as imminent time and again by the administration. The President said last week that there was an attempt to blow up the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Here's, specifically, what he said on Fox News.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News/Friday): I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies, but Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been four embassy; could have been military bases; could have been a lot of other things, too. But it was imminent. And then all of a sudden he was gone.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why couldn't you share that specific threat with senators in a classified briefing?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, that information-- there was a reference in this-- in this exquisite intelligence to an attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad. That information was shared with the Gang of Eight. All that exceptional intelligence shared with the Gang of Eight, not the broader membership of the Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A specific threat against the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to blow it up--\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, I was--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --was shared with the Gang of Eight?\n\nMARK ESPER: I was not in that meeting with the Gang of Eight. But I will tell you, I spoke to one of the briefers. What the briefer said to me coming out of that meeting was his assessment that most, if not all the members, thought that the intelligence was persuasive and that they-- and that the Gang of Eight did not think that it should be released to the broader members of Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, broadly, can you clarify though, was the specific threat that the President shared with Fox News about four U.S. embassies being under threat, also shared with Congress? Why was there a difference?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what the President said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view. I know other members of National Security Team shared that view. That's why I deployed thousands of American paratroopers to the Middle East to reinforce our embassy in Baghdad and other sites throughout the region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Probably, and could have been.\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That is-- that sounds more like an assessment than a specific, tangible threat with a-- a decisive piece of intelligence.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, the President didn't say there was a tangible-- he didn't cite a specific piece of evidence. What he says probably-- he believed, could have been--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying there wasn't one?\n\nMARK ESPER: I didn't see one with regard to four embassies. What I'm saying is I share the President's view that probably-- my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies. The embassies are the most prominent display of American presence in a country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The description had been that this was a imminent threat to U.S. personnel and facilities in the region.\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a more accurate description than what the President provided?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what I've said publicly, I've-- I've said many times, is that we had information that there was going to be attack within a matter of days that would be broad in scale, in other words, more than one country, and that it would be bigger than previous attacks, likely going to take us into open hostilities with Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?\n\nMARK ESPER: That was orchestrated by Qasem-- Qasem Soleimani. He was the one-- was-- has led the attacks against America for twenty years now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK ESPER: So we had every expectation to believe that this would happen. In fact, a very, very senior person from the intelligence community said the risk of inaction is greater than the risk of action. That was compelling for me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?\n\nMARK ESPER: That threat has been disrupted. I think what we have to find out now is continue to work to make sure that that threat is completely eliminated.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you understand the frustration and anger from members of Congress who say why the President-- why can the President tell Fox News something he can't tell members of Congress or-- or members of his administration can't explicitly explain to members of Congress?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, look, I understand the frustration. The fact is that evidence, that information is only available to the Gang of Eight. That's been practice and policy for decades.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you said you don't know that it was told to the Gang of Eight.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, I'm talking about, the intelligence stream, the exquisite intelligence. That was told-- that information of that source and method was revealed to the Gang of Eight. I understand the frustration of the broader members of Congress. They are not going to have access to that information. I would support it if we-- if we didn't jeopardize the sources and methods. And I think the President said the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Mike Lee, who will be with us on this program--\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --also was frustrated with your briefing. And he said, you know, why did you tell members of Congress that it would, essentially, be a negative message to try to call into question that the authorization for military force in Iraq.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, no--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you oppose that debate?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, first of all, for every member that didn't like the brief, there's members that thought it was the greatest brief ever. That was never said that they should not have a debate, that they should have a discussion. I was asked a specific question about do I have concerns about a debate? And what all I said was this: is as that debate continues--don't-- not have a debate--but as that debate ensues, be conscious of the messaging, particularly to our troops, because they are looking for messages. Do they have the support of the American people while they are in harm's way? Why do I say that? My predecessors-- predecessors have said that in the past. And I had the personal experience in the 1991 Gulf War. I was on the ground preparing for our final actions to go into Iraq.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK ESPER: And we watched very carefully the debate in Congress in mid-January of that year to find out did we have the support of the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMARK ESPER: --American people and our lawmakers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, are other Iranian leaders still potential targets? Because we have reported that there was an IRGC leader in Yemen targeted the very same day Qasem Soleimani was killed.\n\nMARK ESPER: Look, I'm not going to speak to any planned or alleged operations. We will exercise everything we need to do to protect the American people, to protect our forces, to protect our embassies.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not denying that report?\n\nMARK ESPER: I'm not going to speak to any-- any reports.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I want to quickly ask you as well about the presence in Iraq. Will the U.S. cut off U.S. aid if the Iraqi government tries to expel U.S. troops?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, let's take this one step at a time. We're not there yet. What we need to do is sit down, have discussions with Iraq. We're doing that now. I want to-- we also intend to do that with our NATO partners. I had a good conversation the other day with the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg. We're going to send a team over to discuss how can NATO play a bigger role in the Iraq mission? Two important missions there. One is to train, advise, and assist the Iraqi military. And number two is the enduring defeat of ISIS. We are committed to both those operations. And I think that we can work out a better way forward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does plussing up a NATO presence mean drawing down the five thousand U.S. troops?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it could. It's been my aspiration for some time to have a smaller footprint in Iraq and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a number in mind?\n\nMARK ESPER: --in the broader Middle East. No, I think that's-- that's a matter for commanders on the ground to assess. We have to look at whether the capabilities that our NATO partners can bring to the-- bring to the-- bring to the fore. And I think that has to be a process in full respect of-- of-- of Iraq's sovereignty. At the end of the day, the United States government wants what the Iraqi people want, and that is a strong, prosperous, and independent Iraq.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Saudi Arabia, we are reporting-- CBS News is reporting that about a dozen or so Saudi service people may be expelled from the United States in the wake of that Pensacola shooting and an investigation. Is that the right number? What-- can you tell us about that? And what did the President mean when he said Saudi Arabia deposited a billion dollars into a bank account in exchange for U.S. troop deployment?\n\nSEC. ESPER: Well, two separate things. You know, first of all, the-- what you're referring to is an investigation being conducted by the DOJ and the FBI in the wake of that-- that tragic shooting in Pensacola some-- few weeks ago. In the wake of that, the department has taken a number of steps to-- to ensure it doesn't happen again. I've signed out directives that address enhanced screening of all of our foreign students that address credentialing going forward, weapons policies, etc. So we're doing everything we can. The investigation is being conducted by DOJ and FBI. I'm sure they will release something on that in the coming days.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the billion dollars into the U.S. bank account?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what the President is referring to is burden sharing. Burden sharing comes in many forms. When we talk to NATO, we talk about contributing more to their GDP to defense commitment. And the President's actions have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars more being contributed by our NATO allies. It includes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not a transaction like what he described.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it includes host nation support, it includes foreign military cells, it includes providing troops on the ground, and in cases it provides helping to offset some of our operations maintenance costs, which the Saudis are committed to doing, just as they did offset costs during the 1990 and '91 Gulf War.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary--\n\nMARK ESPER: Burden sharing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --appreciate your time.\n\nMARK ESPER: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment with the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Good morning to you, Mister Chairman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/Intelligence Committee Chairman/@RepAdamSchiff): Good morning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are part of the Gang of Eight, so you're part of that group that received the very classified briefing that the Defense Secretary was referring to. He said the intelligence was exquisite, and it was incredibly detailed. Do you quibble with his characterization of what you were told?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I don't quibble with it. I think it's just plain wrong. There was no discussion in the Gang of Eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these are the specific targets.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about U.S. embassy, Baghdad?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: It-- it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He said that was specifically referenced.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that Secretary Pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. That was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. In the view of the briefers, there was plotting. There was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. And so when you hear the President out there on Fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the Secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. When Secretary Pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking Soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. That's not an intelligence conclusion. That is Pompeo's personal opinion. Intelligence--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a polite way of saying they're lying?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, you know, you could certainly put it that way. But, frankly, I think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. And when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with Iran, that's a dangerous thing to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But to be fair, because you are the Intel Committee chairman, you know, the Intel Committee often or-- that the Intelligence Committee works in assessments, in judgments, in putting together mosaics, pieces of information to come to a conclusion. When Esper is working in beliefs and projections, isn't that just how it works? Impossibilities and not necessarily always having one conclusive piece of the exact place and time?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, that's exactly right. But that-- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. If we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking Soleimani out make us safer or less safe? They would say to us, Congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policymakers need to make. What we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. Those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that Soleimani was plotting, as far as I can tell. And so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --the burden of imminence, of showing imminence with very great specifics, I think is very high.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I-- I just want to button up because the Defense Secretary also said that in that Gang of Eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though, he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the Gang of Eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of Congress. He said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this is a political decision?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: He said a couple of things. He said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. That's not correct. I can tell you I wasn't, and there were other members of the Gang of Eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. In terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. And so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. It wasn't because I don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you heard from members of the intelligence community that they objected to what the administration did?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: They are not going to volunteer that. In other words, the intelligence community doesn't want to get crosswise with the White House and with--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've spoken to CIA director Gina Haspel?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was, it appears, according to Esper's description, also her assessment.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't know whether Esper has represented that the CIA director supported or didn't support a strike on Soleimani. The job of the CIA director is to say, this is what our intelligence shows, this is what our intelligence analysts tell us will be the repercussions if you take Soleimani out. That is the principal role. It's the President's call whether that justifies taking a strike, but that should be done in consultation with Congress and approved by Congress. And neither of those things happened here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should other IRGC leaders be targeted?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I think that we have escalated enough, and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even though Iran says it's standing down and the President has used that phrase?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think what we're likely to see, at least in the near term, is the end of Iran's overt attacks, like the missile attack on our bases. I don't think that we conclude-- conclude at all that we've seen an end to the-- their use of Shia and other proxies. And so the risk to American troops and to American civilians continues, I think is-- is greater now as a result of the administration's actions. Iran has been humiliated by-- by this taking out of their top leadership, but also by their disastrous shoot down of this civilian aircraft.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: That makes them, I think, more dangerous and provocative in the sense that we may very well see covert retaliation against the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key-- a key-- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. I'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a Senate trial?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, that'll be the speaker's decision. I don't want to get ahead of her--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to be?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --thinking. I've told the speaker that I will play whatever role that she and the caucus believe would be useful.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing John Bolton, the former national security adviser to the President. Is that something you would be looking at? Are you looking at?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know it's certainly something that we are considering. But, look, Americans want to see a fair trial in the Senate. They want to see a trial that's fair to the President and they want to see a trial that's fair to the American people, that brings all the facts forward. There-- there's little sense in bringing Bolton in to the House and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. If they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. He has offered to come forward and testify. There is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the President's wrongdoing. If McConnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --it will be the first impeachment trial in history where the subject of the trial didn't resign, mid trial where they didn't have witnesses. That's not a fair trial. That's a sham. That's a cover up. And I think one of the things that holding on to the articles has succeeded doing is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --fleshing out McConnell and the President's desire to make this a cover up.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will get to what that trial might look like with Mike Lee, senator from Utah, a Republican ally of the President, who will be with us soon.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee. He's written a number of books about the Constitution and our country's founding documents. He joins us this morning from Salt Lake City. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE (R-Utah/@SenMikeLee): Good morning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Secretary of Defense say that there was a specific threat assessment shared with the Gang of Eight. Should that threat stream have been shared with the rest of Congress, people like yourself?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, it should have. It's important to remember that the Gang of Eight does not equal Congress. The House of Representatives has four hundred and thirty-five members. The Senate has one hundred members. Look, I understand Secretary Esper's point. I understand that not every piece of information can or pragmatically should be shared with all five hundred and thirty-five members of Congress, but drive by notification to eight people is not the same as notification to Congress. Remember, there is an important constitutional reason for this. We have some overlap between-- and some natural tension between the Article 2 commander-in-chief power--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --enjoyed by the President and the Article 1 Section 8 War Power that is possessed by Congress. In order to know and understand where one power ends and another begins in any context, we need to have a certain amount of information--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You--\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --and an adequate amount of information was not shared with us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there was information shared with Fox News in that interview the President gave where he said it was his belief that there were four embassies that were going to be threatened by attack by Iran. You've spoken to the President. Was that television interview the first time you heard it?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, it was. Let me say about the President. I have great respect for President Trump for how he's handled this situation and how he's handled other situations involving his immense power as commander-in-chief. I believe more than any other President in my lifetime, President Trump has shown restraint in the way he's exercised that power. There-- any other President--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a problem with learning it on television?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --would've taken us to war several times. Yes, but the problem there is not with the President. The problem is with those who are briefing us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Those who are briefing us, I believe would have done a different job under the light of day had television cameras been there than they did in private--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --where his boss couldn't see what they were saying, that they were not helpful and they didn't reflect well on the President's great restraint that he's shown and deference to the American people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to continue this conversation, specifically, about War Powers as well on the other side of this commercial break. So stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with Senator Mike Lee and then Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and former Secretary of State John Kerry. Plus, a report from Elizabeth Palmer, our CBS News team in Iran. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're back now with more from Republican Senator Mike Lee. Senator, you heard the defense secretary say there was not one definitive, specific piece of intelligence that indicated these four embassy attacks were being planned. It was a belief. Does that give you pause?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: No, not necessarily. Look, I want to be clear, within hours after General Soleimani was killed, I made a public statement to the effect that the fact that he is dead is a good thing. It's a positive signal for the safety and security of the American people. And I stand by that. This is a guy who would've done a lot of damage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not sure if the Senator can still hear me. I think we just had an interruption on that feed. So, hopefully, we'll pick it up. Standing by, though, in Richmond, going live now to Virginia's senator, Tim Kaine. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE (D-Virginia/@timkaine): Good morning, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you and Senator Lee have actually found some common cause here, despite the difference in your parties, on a frustration regarding the President's lack of consultation with Congress. And I want to dive into that. But let's--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- start off specifically on-- on what we learned. Because you are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has oversight of the State Department and, therefore, embassies, were you aware that there was any kind of threat, specifically, to embassy Baghdad and three other posts, as the President has described?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: No, I wasn't, Margaret. I-- I was at the classified briefing because I'm both a-- an Armed Services and Foreign Relations member. That was not told to us in the classified briefing, nor was there a suggestion that multiple embassies were threatened. And I think that was one of the reasons that the senators in the briefing were so unhappy. We felt that the evidence was far short of imminent threat. We were mad that they were so dismissive of the notion that Congress would have anything to do with questions of war and peace. And we also thought that the administration was very cavalier about the Iraqi reaction-- the Iraqi resolution of parliament that the U.S. should leave. They were sort of like, oh, that's just the way the Iraqis talk.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: This is a very serious concern. And the administration was downplaying it in a way that I think was very unrealistic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, specifically, the Defense Secretary said the Gang of Eight was told in specific detail and they chose not to share it with members of Congress. You are saying that you were never told of a threat to the U.S. embassy?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: No, no, and, as I've talked to the Gang of Eight, again, this is classified information, I'm not going to put that all on the table. But members of the Gang of Eight on the Senate side, were not happy with the degree of him-- this-- this question of was there an imminent threat? The administration says there was exquisite and detailed intelligence. That means it was specific. But for it to be-- justify the President taking, essentially, an act of war on Iraqi soil to wipe out a-- an Iranian military leader, it had to not just be a plan, but an imminent threat. And that usually means it's more than a plan. There's been some move toward making a decision to execute on the plan. And we heard nothing about that in the briefing or in any of the conversations I've had with administration leaders.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it not sufficient enough for the administration to say broadly there was a threat to U.S. personnel in the region, as Esper said, within days? Why don't you trust that?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, look, the bottom line is the Constitution makes really plain it's-- it's Congress that gets to make the decision about whether to go to war. And, ultimately, that's a judgment about the troops. We don't want to put our troops in harm's way unless there is deliberation in front of the American people about whether it's important. Now a President can act unilaterally to stop-- defend against an ongoing attack or an imminent threat.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: But if it's more than that, it's supposed to be for Congress, because Congress will have this debate in a way that the American public will be informed of the stakes. And then if we debate and vote at the end of the day--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --then it's fair to ask our men and women in uniform to risk their lives and health. But if we're not willing to do that, or if the President tries to rush to war and escalate, then you run the risk of making mistakes that are just so fatal in their consequences you can hardly ever, you know, undo them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President says he doesn't want to go to war. I want to get to that authorization of use of force.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Yep.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We went back and we looked, and-- and the original AUMF from 2001, and then there's one in '02, but in the wake of the al Qaeda attacks on this country, that was the premise for this authorization Congress gave at the right time.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It has-- was then used over the past almost twenty years to send troops to Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines, Cuba. There are Democratic presidents. Why hasn't any party made a full-throated effort to get a new authorization for military force?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, Margaret, as you know, I have been working on this since I came to the Senate, and I have the same concern. When I came to the Senate in 2013, I criticized President Obama for taking us into military action in Libya without congressional authorization, for going on ISIS in Iraq and Syria without congressional authorization. I will say this, when I started on this crusade six, seven years ago, very few people were interested in it. But in the last year, the good news is finally, members of both parties and in both Houses have started to step up and take the congressional responsibility seriously. I do think we have to rewrite and redo the 2001 authorization that authorize us to wage war against non-state terrorist groups--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --that are connected to the perpetrators--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but what--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --of the 9/11 attack.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --what you're proposing now and you happen--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Here's-- yeah, here's what I'm proposing now is that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --you're working with Senator Lee on it. But I just want to point out that there does seem to still be a carve-out for imminent threats. How--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: And there should be. So, sen-- senator--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --how would that not stop what the President just did?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, Senator Lee and I are basically trying to restore this to its constitutional place, so we have-- we have a resolution that would basically say no war against Iran unless Congress, specifically, votes to authorize it. But we do state, as you point out, the President can defend the nation against an imminent threat, and that is existing law. That's-- the constitutional framers clearly understood that. We're skeptical of the evidence that this President has put on the table about imminent threat. That's why we're challenging the briefers and that's why we're challenging the President. But at the end of the day, I think this is less about the President than it is about Congress. Congresses of both parties for a very long time--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --have hidden under their desks rather than have votes about war. Votes about war are tough. I-- I've cast two of them in the Foreign Relations Committee. Fundamentally different than any vote you'll ever cast.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: And so many members of Congress, what they want to do is hide under their desk, let the President just do whatever the President wants, and then they think they can escape accountability for the consequences of war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: It's time to go back to what the framers envisioned. We shouldn't send our best and brightest into harm's way if Congress doesn't have the guts to-- to have a debate and have a vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Kaine, thank you for laying out your case. You-- you were persuasive enough to get Senator Mike Lee on board with this, and he joins us now.\n\nSenator, thanks for sticking with us. I know we had some problems with the uplink there, but we can see and hear you now just fine. What Senator Kaine, essentially, said here is no elected official wanted to get their hands dirt-- dirty and go on the record to vote for a war, which is why Congress is allowed for this to continue without a new vote on an AUMF. Can you get other Republicans on board with this beyond yourself and Rand Paul?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, we can, and I believe we will. Look, my grievance here is not with the President of the United States. He's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the Constitution. It's not even really as much with the briefers, even though, I didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with Congress. Congress is the problem. We have to remember that this isn't just about this President or this war. This is about the future question of what any President can do to get us into any war. Over many decades, Congresses and White Houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of Congress to wash their hands of it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --to step away and say, this isn't our problem and we have created this problem. We created the day-- (AUDIO CUT) of a full explanation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator, can you hear me?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, good.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Pretty fine, thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We had some interruption there. You spoke to the President. Have you received any private assurance that Congress would be consulted if he plans to take future military action against Iran?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes. And it's always implicit that we will be consulted. I always want to make sure that any step that is taken is either authorized by one of the AUMFs in question in '02 or '01, or that there is some indication that the strike in question is necessary in order to repel an imminent or actual attack on the United States. That's always the question. And that's one of the reasons why I'm co-sponsoring Tim-- Tim Kaine's resolution is to make clear--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --that neither the '01 nor the '02 authorization can be read fairly to authorize a war against Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But this was-- there are things short of war. There are-- is hostile activity. There is, you know, a targeted strike like this. And-- and what you are supporting here, this resolution, there is still a carve-out for an imminent threat. So how would that stop the administration from doing again what it just did?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Well, anytime we have something like this and we've signaled in advance that it's not covered by an existing AUMF, then, yeah, we're-- we're relying on the good faith use of a commander-in-chief power by the President. This is not a new precedent; it's not-- it's not contingent on or-- or rooted in-- in this presidential administration. This goes back to 1791 when George Washington pointed out that it's okay for the President to act in order to repel an actual or imminent attack--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --without authorization from Congress. But he also noted that it's important that any sustained military effort does have to be authorized.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Lee, thank you for joining us. Next time, I hope you're here sitting across from me so we can see and hear each other more clearly next time.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment with former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Dubuque, Iowa, and the presidential campaign trail where former Secretary of State John Kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former Vice President Joe Biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background. Good morning to you, Mister Secretary.\n\nJOHN KERRY (Former Secretary of State/@JohnKerry): Sorry about that. Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to pick up kind of where we just left off with-- with the two senators. You know you-- you've been touting Joe Biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. Bernie Sanders, his opponent, has-- has taken that on as a reason essentially, not to specifically focusing in on Biden's vote to help authorize the-- the war in Iraq. He called it appalling that after eighteen years, Joe Biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong on the Iraq War, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history. Given what you know about the region and how Iran was, essentially, empowered by that, why-- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, I think I-- I-- in fact, Margaret, I think that Bernie, regrettably, is distorting Joe's record in the following sense. I mean he doesn't have what Joe Biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the National Security Council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of Iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. I-- I think that-- that I know very well what Joe's position was because I answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04. And it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a President who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy; that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. And, ultimately, we learned, as Joe did and I did, that the intelligence was distorted. So Joe spoke out and criticized. Joe was against what they were doing. The vote was not a vote, specifically, to go to war. It was a vote for the President to have leverage with respect to getting Saddam Hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me. And I think we were let down and Joe has said many times that it was a mistake, obviously, to trust the words of the administration who didn't follow through on what they said they were going to do. And I invite you to go back, read my speech on the floor and others--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --where I said this is not a vote, specifically, to let the President go to war. So I think Bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there. I understand that but I think the vice president has unparalleled--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president. And he, in my judgment, is the one person running for President--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: Joe has told the truth. People know that. And I think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very, very delicate time--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --when foreign policy experience--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --is, in fact, a premium.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is. And Iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. But, virtually, every single Democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same Iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. There's-- some would say a shell of it left now. Shouldn't voters expect more out of a Iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, Joe Biden is, in fact, providing more, which is to recognize that-- that it's not enough just to go back to where we were because, obviously, circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years. And-- and what-- what Vice President Biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement, which was always contemplated. Margaret, you were there. You're an expert at this. You know exactly what the truth is about it. We were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate Yemen, Hezbollah, threats against Israel--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --the regional question of trafficking of arms. And-- and so Vice President Biden understands that now has to also be front and center--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --as you-- as you revive the agreement. But the truth is, France, Germany--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --Britain, China, Russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it's the strongest, most transparent, most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until President Trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President--\n\nJOHN KERRY: And everything--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --the President's going on the--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --that's happened in the last days--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --going on the-- the attack on that deal this morning, specifically, mentioning you. Perhaps, not a surprise. But, you know, I-- I know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions, gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program. There was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different, separate dispute. The President this week put blame on the administration, your-- the administration you served on with, essentially, helping to provide money to the IRGC. I want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to CNBC when you were asked about how Iran would spend the money.\n\nJOHN KERRY (U.S. Secretary of State/January 2016/CNBC): I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. You know, to some degree I'm-- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that could be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I'm sure at some point some of it will.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I remember talking to you at the time. Money is fungible.\n\nJOHN KERRY: Sure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why, though, did you think--\n\nJOHN KERRY: Absolutely. Money is fungible.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of-- of what would happen with that money?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, what I was really saying, I think, first of all, Margaret, you are an expert at this. You were there. You know that the President's tweet is a lie. And the President tweeted this morning, because I am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. You and the media, I think, need to call a lie a lie. You know--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, I asked you that question in 2015, too.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --they didn't get a hundred and fifty billion dollars. No, no, no. But let me just finish. You know-- yes. And I'll-- I'll answer that. I was saying, clearly, some money from the budget of Iran is going to go to the IRGC. It always has. That's no surprise. But the truth is and-- and President Trump-- I-- I-- well, he probably doesn't know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the Congress that very, very little money actually went to the IRGC at all. Most of the money went to the economy of Iran, which is precisely what I said and what we all said. So, the IRGC has never had a problem getting money, Margaret. But the fact is Donald Trump keeps saying they got a hundred and fifty billion dollars. A lie. He keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. It did not. His own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. So, you know, we have to stop--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --dealing with questions on Donald Trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. The fact is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --that mo-- the vast proportion of that money--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --went to the economy of Iran and they're always going to be funding the IRGC. There was no question about that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: And the IRGC budget has not gone up markedly as a result--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --of what happened with the agreement, period.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, thank you for joining us. I want to take a break because we have a report from Iran.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has been reporting from Tehran all week. Yesterday, she and her team were unexpectedly asked to leave by the Iranian authorities and have now departed Iran. Before they left she filed this reporter's notebook.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: This week ended with the unthinkable, Iran admitted to shooting down a passenger plane killing everyone on board. But it had begun with the unknowable, what Iran would do to avenge the killing by America of its most revered military hero, Qasem Soleimani.\n\nThis is not just a mourning procession, it's a political message.\n\nIn all my years of covering Iran, I have never seen such high-stakes drama. Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, warned the U.S. revenge was coming.\n\nMOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF (Tuesday): In a clear and proportionate.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER (Tuesday): When?\n\nMOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF (Tuesday): As we choose.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: They chose that very night. Iranian missiles fell on two U.S. bases in Iraq.\n\nDAVID MARTIN: A rocket attack was launched against the Al Asad Air Base.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: The world held its breath.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Wednesday): The fact that we have this great military equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: But with no casualties, America held its fire. And the two old enemies appeared to call it a draw. Ordinary Tehranis heading out in the first real snowfall of the season called it a relief.\n\nWere you relieved when he said there would not be another American attack?\n\nWOMAN: Yes. I sleep very--\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: Well?\n\nWOMAN: Very well.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: But another bombshell was about to burst.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: CBS News has learned that U.S. officials are confident that Iran shot down a Ukrainian jetliner.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: On Wednesday morning, wreckage and bodies from Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 lay strewn across Iran's western suburbs. By Friday when we managed to reach the site, there was little left, even for the scavengers.\n\nLocal people say that yesterday, Thursday, around lunch time, trucks, cranes showed up and took most of the pieces that were here away.\n\nAmid rumors of a cover-up, world leaders called for an international investigation and the victims' families prayed for answers to soothe their grief. The answer came suddenly in a stunning TV address that said Iran's army had shot down the plane by mistake. It was a huge admission for this proud and prickly country, which may have appeased critics outside Iran but it's inflamed them at home. Protests erupted in Tehran last night, crowds of students who despise the government for its corruption and ineptitude. Iran starts next week not only in conflict with the U.S. but also with itself.\n\n(Crowd protesting)\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Elizabeth Palmer reporting from Tehran.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Victories by the two Democrats in Georgia's Senate runoff elections could mean a third stimulus check for Americans this spring, according to analysts. That would provide crucial financial support for households that this month are receiving $600 payments directed by the most recent relief bill — an effort that has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans as doing too little to help families that are struggling through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCBS News projects that Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have defeated incumbent Republican senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. The surprise outcome will result in a 50-50 split between Senate Democrats and Republicans, giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tiebreaking vote. That will ease passage of another stimulus relief bill, which President-elect Joe Biden has previously said he supports, according to political and financial analysts.\n\nAnother so-called Economic Impact Payment would come on the heels of the most recent relief measure, a $900 billion bill that President Donald Trump delayed and criticized the $600 payments as ridiculously low. Democrats and some Republicans had supported lifting the checks to $2,000 per person, but the effort failed due to opposition from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nA big question is whether lawmakers might push for $2,000 or $1,400 cash payments, with the latter representing the difference between the $600 checks and the quashed effort to boost them to $2,000 in the most recent bill. On January 10, Mr. Biden tweeted that $600 is is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table.\n\nWe need $2,000 stimulus checks, he added.\n\n$600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. We need $2,000 stimulus checks. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 11, 2021\n\nWe expect growing anticipation that Democrats will pursue additional stimulus, with a $2,000 check (or at least the remaining $1,400) as a leading item, Ed Mills, an analyst with investment bank Raymond James, said in a report following the Georgia election.\n\nBiden: Latest aid a down payment\n\nMr. Biden has described the $900 billion stimulus bill passed last month as a down payment on a more comprehensive relief package. That could translate into a new package ranging from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, according to Heights Securities analyst Hunter Hammond.\n\nThe debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. It's about real lives. Hardworking Americans need help, and they need it now. Georgia — you have the power to make it happen. Vote. pic.twitter.com/yFBBk1YAEm — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 5, 2021\n\nA sweetened stimulus package would likely come in March, Hammond and Mills predict. That's because the most recent relief measure extended unemployment programs until mid-March, which puts pressure on Congress to act on additional financial support by that cutoff to continue jobless benefits for millions of unemployed Americans.\n\nDemocrats are likely to push for a new round of checks worth $2,000, Hammond predicted, noting that both Mr. Biden, as well as Warnock and Ossoff, had campaigned on the issue. While stumping for the candidates ahead of this week's vote, Mr. Biden said their election would help get $2,000 checks out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble.\n\n8 million more poor people\n\nEven with previous stimulus aid, 8 million Americans have slipped into poverty during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of others are experiencing a range of hardships, from food insecurity to trouble paying their bills, after the crisis upended the economy.\n\nThe $600 checks issued by the Treasury Department last month may last the neediest Americans no more than six weeks, according to financial-services app Earnin. The firm found that people who had been living paycheck to paycheck and who got the initial $1,200 checks last year spent their money within one week.\n\nSome economists say much more funding is needed beyond the recent $900 billion package to help the economy until coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed, which may not be until this summer or fall.\n\nAs much as $3 trillion could be needed to ensure a swift economic recovery, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The left-leaning think tank noted that the most recent stimulus package omitted funding for state and local governments, which have seen a plunge in tax revenue due to the crisis.\n\nAlthough the stimulus checks are helping households weather the crisis, most economists view other relief measures as more effective — especially programs that target people who are currently suffering a financial hit, such as unemployment benefits. That's because the cash payments are distributed to almost every middle- and low-income household, regardless of whether they have been impacted financially by the crisis.\n\nChecks are generally less potent in supporting spending than unemployment benefits, wrote Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco in a recent research report. He added that the $900 billion relief bill will likely fall short of what is needed to prevent a rough winter.
The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders that aired Sunday, March 1, 2020, on Face the Nation.\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Good morning, MARGARET.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two man race?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we've got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts and a number of states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean, I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we've got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, MARGARET, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, MARGARET, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. What we have done is received more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, look, Mr. Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. All I can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is- I didn't say that. What I would say--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSEN. SANDERS:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, MARGARET, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, two points. I'm a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats and have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, MARGARET, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare. They can't afford healthcare. They're scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. We can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean, that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota and other states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the UN says of you that you're not welcome in that country and Anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean, they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid, I spent time in Israel. I am not in- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel, but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You've got 70 percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even handed policy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel. I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The president just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, MARGARET, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I- I speak as somebody who helped lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we've got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care, we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nWashington may have a new Congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. Just words.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the U.S. government remains shuttered for the third week. President Trump warns it could last months or years and Democrats dig in.\n\nNANCY PELOSI: We're not a doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. The Democratic whip, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: Nancy Pelosi, I extend to you this gavel.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth Congress gavels in, Nancy Pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as Democrats take control of the House and usher in the most diverse Congress in history. A panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the President.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: This is a national disgrace.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. One high-profile Democrat jumps in.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: Hello, Council Bluffs. Whoo.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And other potential candidates near their own decisions.\n\nAll that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.\n\nWe begin today with Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin who is in Springfield, Illinois. Senator Durbin is among a group of senators talking to the White House about how to end this shutdown. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. The President said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. If he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will Senate Democrats do?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the President says he could bypass Congress by declaring this national emergency. So what would you do if he-- he went that route?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. You were in the room with the President on Friday. Did you hear any points of agreement?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. But what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. This gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. As of last night, three Republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. How close are we to ending this shutdown?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: According to the White House, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among Democrats, right? They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would just say, do you remember the President's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the Mexicans. How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he now says--\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Talk about-- or--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --it doesn't have to be concrete.\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen the more specific financial request that the White House says they were giving to Democrats?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: They did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. And this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There has been speculation and-- and our next guest, Senator Lindsey Graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for DACA, sort of, a trade here. The President stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on DACA before he comes to any kind of proposal here. Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Listen, Senator Graham and I could not be more different politically. He's a conservative Republican from South Carolina; I'm a progressive Democrat from Illinois. But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you very much, Senator.\n\nWe will turn now to South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who joins us from Clemson. Senator Graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the President, often shares his advice. Senator, did you speak to the President this weekend about this shutdown?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the people in the room are your colleague Senator Durbin along with--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --along with Speaker Pelosi. You don't--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room. Neither one of them are in the room.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He was on Friday. He was--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. Neither one--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --on Friday with the President.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They sent staff. They sent staff people to do the negotiation. The vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Today.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Dick Durbin is a good guy. He's a reasonable guy. But Nancy Pelosi has made progress. She's gone from not a penny to a dollar. Nancy Pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. President Trump sees it as real. Until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. The President is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. It will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. And every plan I've supported in the past with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --including walls and fences. Except now when Trump is President.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're going to get paid. So--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only God knows what they go through to get here. The Democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what about--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --until that changes there's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the Coast Guard? Who are not going to get paid.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. They're being held hostage. They're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. They're being held hostage by people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't want to--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --who accuse them--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --open the government and then continue talking?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. That ICE is not the problem, it's the solution. The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It's to implement policies--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --Democrats have voted for in the past on President Trump's watch. We're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. We'll have wall as part of a border security plan. We're going nowhere. Wall plus DACA plus TPS makes sense. But you'll never convince me--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President open to--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that we don't need a wall.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is the President open--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to that compromise you just floated there?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I really believe that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That DACA and TPS for a wall?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But let's dig into that--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If the left is going to--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --because that's significant what you said there--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --if you think the President--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think he is open to it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --is indeed open to a DACA for wall trade here because he stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When is that going to be put on the table? That offer.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. We're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don't see anything happening.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've worked with the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner on criminal justice reform.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of DACA for wall.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, he is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the President really seemed to shoot that down in the Rose Garden the other day.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am here to tell you--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When would we see that put on the table? Is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When you see Dick Durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. When you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. When you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. When that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal Democrats who don't see a border security problem. They see their own government being the problem--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --not the illegal immigrant. Until that changes we'll never get anywhere. There is a deal to be had here--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --but it will include a wall. And if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Syria. I know you watch the region and you had criticized the President's decision to pull out. The National Security Adviser John Bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a U.S. drawdown and it'll be dependent on Turkey agreeing not to slaughter our Kurdish allies. It sounds like he's describing--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --an indefinite timeline of U.S. troops staying in Syria.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I had lunch with the President last week and I came away a bit encourage. There are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you for joining us.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.\n\nAll of you just came to Washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. All of you took a vote to reopen the government but Leader McConnell in the Senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. Where do we go from here, Congresswoman?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL (D-New Jersey/@RepSherrill): Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. We voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the Senate, within the last month. And so I think what we're asking Congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the President has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. Do you see, Congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED (D-Texas/@RepColinAllred): Well, let's be very clear. He doesn't want border security. We have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. There is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. A five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. There's a lot of things we can do instead of that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it just a matter of semantics here? Border fence, some kind of barrier? I mean is there movement for Democrats to support what the President in some way is asking for?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, let me say, I'm from Texas. We have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. Fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. But we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: The room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. Right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. We don't--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that we have serious issues throughout the country. The point here is that what I'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. What, you want to also bring horses back to the United States cavalry?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Bring some rowboats to the Navy? We can put Trump's name on it. This is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? Let's get back to work. It's why we all ran and I know it's what the Republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. And I promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. This is not political suicide.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the Senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for Democrats. Do you see your-- your fellow House members getting on board?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES (D-Connecticut/@JahanaHayesCT): Well I think-- I apologize I lost my voice yesterday. But I think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. We have to get to work. We cannot keep operating in hard lines. We cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. We have to move. That's why we were elected. That's what we were sent here to do. We have to get back to work.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would be open--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for Democrats, like protections for DREAMers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. So, stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made a name for herself taking on Republicans in her own party. Tonight, she sits down with 60 MINUTES. Here's part of her interview.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): You're willing to compromise?\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's just about what we choose to compromise. My personal opinion. And I know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. And--\n\nANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): The Democratic Party has lost so much.\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): I think so. I think-- I think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with Mitch McConnell, whether it's compromising on climate change I think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am I open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. Absolutely.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 MINUTES.\n\nNext up on FACE THE NATION, we'll have more of our panel of new House members.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with our panel of new House members. Earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in Washington.\n\nAnother topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. The House Oversight Chairman, Elijah Cummings, said that's premature. What do you all think? Is that too soon?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I-- I think so. I'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the FBI finished their investigation. I think we've got to let Mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're waiting on the Mueller Report?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I am.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the tone of this conversation? One of your colleagues, Congresswoman from Michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. What do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, I'm from Staten Island. I have no problem with profanity, okay? Well what-- what I have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. I-- I-- I certainly object to it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Premature.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Premature.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. Congresswoman, as we said, you're from Connecticut. In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Well, I think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. I think we have to have background checks. We have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So would you commend the Trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But not enough?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's a first step.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Rose, you served in Afghanistan as we said in your introduction. Both President Obama and President Trump have wanted to draw down troops--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --from that war zone. What do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. So the key here in Afghanistan, because we saw in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq was absolutely foolish. But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. And I intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the Taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: No. It-- it absolutely isn't. But we have been at war in Afghanistan now for seventeen years. To put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the United States military who were born after 9/11. And we cannot just have perpetual war. But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. We need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like what the Trump administration is suggesting.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, what I just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. I believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. I don't want to see Americans put at risk. I've watched loved ones get hurt. I don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. But I just want us to have a long-term strategy--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the United States military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. What do you think? Do you support not just Afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but I don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in Syria we're just pulling out.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, this week, not only a new week in Congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- I know, get ready.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, I know you're sort of, wow.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Exhausted.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's exhausting, but it's beginning.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a Democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: You know, I-- I think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. And there are certainly lessons you can learn, I think, from some of our races. I think there--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Like what?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: I think-- I think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have anyone in mind from your home state?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I certainly like my former boss, Julian Castro--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. And-- and we have a lot of political talent in Texas, so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the rest of you?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I'm supporting Mikie.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But if I could just have one important thing. It's obvious that election season's starting again. But what we can't do is campaign in the halls of Congress. When it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say Oh, I don't want to give this President a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what you think is happening now in the House?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And all of that requires working with a Republican Senate--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and a Republican President.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Yes, sure.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And all of you are willing to do that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. It's just different political parties run-- won. If you think about what Donald Trump ran on, okay? If you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, I know. But he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect Medicare and Social Security, draining the swamp. We ran on many of those same things, the American people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. And now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for this conversation. I wish you all luck as lawmakers. Welcome to Washington.\n\nWe'll be right back with our reporters' panel.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, Dan Balz is the chief correspondent for The Washington Post, Ed O'Keefe is the political correspondent right here at CBS News, Shannon Pettypiece is a White House reporter for Bloomberg News and Mark Landler covers the White House and foreign policy for-- at The New York Times. So, Ed, I'll start with you. Did you hear any points of agreement or were Democrats and Republicans just talking past each other on the show?\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and I think elsewhere as well. Look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now? And-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. We got a ways to go. Congress doesn't get back till Tuesday night, Wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. I am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You had Senator Durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. You had Senator Graham saying no wall, no deal. Is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, Dan?\n\nDAN BALZ (The Washington Post/@danbalz): There's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Whatever that means.\n\nDAN BALZ: And-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. So whatever that means. And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. Every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. It feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. I win, you lose.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nDAN BALZ: That's never the way these kinds of things end. We'll see whether this is a different situation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. But it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. Is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?\n\nDAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Shannon, I mean, is that the calculus? We didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of American workers--\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE (Bloomberg News/@spettypi): Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --who are waiting for paychecks.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?\n\nMARK LANDLER (The New York Times/@MarkLandler): Well, it's-- it is interesting. It's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on December 19th when President Trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. His words meet reality on the ground and I think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. It's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.\n\nMARK LANDLER: Indeed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.\n\nMARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the American people. More to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.\n\nWe'll be right back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our reporters' panel. We saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. Dan. And Elizabeth Warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. How do you see Democrats defining themselves?\n\nDAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So lots of exploring without declaring, Ed?\n\nED O'KEEFE: Yeah. I mean, Senator Warren was the first-- second to do it actually, Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary, was the first before Christmas, and will make it official next weekend. But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This is Biden.\n\nED O'KEEFE: This is Biden. And Biden said in response to her, what's her name? Give me her number. He had an aide get her phone number. The next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think I should run? Yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do I will volunteer for you. And he asked her all these reasons why. That happens. And they're all doing this. It's got to be tremendous for their ego. But whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can I stand up against somebody like Elizabeth Warren--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --who has a name ID in the network. Can I somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, I have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time I have to find a way to play in California, in Georgia and all these other places because of early voting. It's going to be a tremendous competition and one that I think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but I think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It-- it sounds there-- Shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of Congress--\n\nED O'KEEFE: Oh, yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: He-- he did what he said. And they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.\n\nED O'KEEFE: You know, to your point about campaigning in Congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced Republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor Republican candidates. To-- to watch those kinds of Democrats now in Congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, Medicare for All, agreeing with the President maybe we should withdraw all our forces from Syria.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for President and their party. And it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, I mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what Shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the President prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. You can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. Afghanistan, when the President had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, Wall Street Journal came down pretty hard on him.\n\nMARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. And-- and he also attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to their misadventures in Afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of Soviet Union. But to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, I think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing American troops from foreign conflicts. I think it's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So did Obama.\n\nMARK LANDLER: So did Obama. And so do-- as you say many Democrats. What I don't think has been tested maybe at least I'd love to see it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Hm-Mm.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for President Trump's base. We know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMARK LANDLER: And I think that also explains this decision before Christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. I just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Good question. We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Rural America is no longer where many young college graduates want to settle, with some fleeing for urban centers like New York or San Francisco. Aside from the glamour of living in those locations, there may be another culprit for the rural brain drain that's occurring across the U.S.: student loan debt.\n\nAdults with student loans are less likely to remain in rural areas than those without it, and adults with the highest student loan balances are the most likely to migrate to cities, according to new research from the Federal Reserve. That's contributing to a growing college attainment gap between urban and rural America, which has diverged from about 5 percentage points in 1970 to 14 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAs fewer college-educated young people remain in rural locations, those regions become less attractive to other young grads. Employers, for their part, increasingly are focusing on urban locations to recruit these workers. Added to the mix is the pressure of the country's growing student loan debt, which places more pressure on grads to seek higher-paying jobs -- which are more plentiful in cities.\n\nRight now we are experiencing the greatest opportunity gap between rural and urban places in history, said Matt Dunne, the founder of the Hartland, Vermont-based Center on Rural Innovation, which is working on creating rural innovation hubs to develop entrepreneurship. People believe the only place you can have an aspirational job is to cram into already overcrowded cities that are facing housing crises rather than make your way in rural locations.\n\nThat creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, said Dunne, who worked for Google from a remote office in Vermont before starting the Center on Rural Innovation.\n\nRural America's student debt problem\n\nRural America is increasingly old, shrinking in population and falling behind when it comes to its share of educated residents. About 19 percent of rural residents held college degrees in 2016, compared with 33 percent of urban residents, a gap that's widened over the past few decades, the Agriculture Department said last year.\n\nTo be sure, the Federal Reserve said it couldn't determine whether the student loan debt is causing young college grads to move to cities. Nevertheless, the trend is notable: About half of rural residents who took out student loans remained in those areas six years later, compared with two-thirds of rural residents who didn't take out loans. And the grads with the most debt were the most likely to leave, they found.\n\nThere's a good reason why young workers with student loans would head for the big city. Cumulative job growth since 2009 -- after the recession ended -- surged almost 14 percent in cities with at least 1 million residents, compared with 2.7 percent for rural areas and small cities, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCity wages\n\nWorkers with college degrees earn far more in big cities, about $71,000 per year. But if they remain in rural areas, those college grads earn about $50,000 annually, Goldman found.\n\nNot surprisingly, college grads with student debt had better financial outcomes than those who stayed in rural areas, the Fed found. Those big-city migrants are more likely to pay down their loans, less likely to default, and are more likely to become homeowners, they said.\n\nThe allure of higher pay and wider professional opportunities is enticing -- and hard for rural communities to compete with, Dunne noted.\n\nThe general drumbeat is you have to go to urban locations, in particular tech centers, in order to have a new economy job, he said. That's accelerating the drive toward cities and the investment cycles in companies that are starting in cities. There's a notion you can't find talent in rural areas or smaller cities.\n\nA divided America?\n\nThe trend is worsening the economic outcomes for rural residents while making resources -- like housing -- scarcer and more expensive in large cities, economists and policy experts say. It's also blamed for the widening political gap between rural regions and big coastal cities.\n\nAny time you see a massive separation along demographic lines, it's not healthy, Dunne said. You want to have diversity of skills, education and perspective in any part of the country.\n\nIn many cases, Americans who live in large cities would welcome an opportunity to move to a rural location, but may perceive smaller regions as lacking professional opportunities. Almost one out of four urban residents aid they would like to move to a different community, with a third of those saying they'd like to find a rural community to live in, Pew found in a 2018 study.\n\nLoan forgiveness\n\nDunne, who credits his own lack of student loans with allowing him to return to Vermont to begin his career, said he made a proposal in the state's last legislative session to create a program that would forgive up to $20,000 of student debt over two years for college grads who bought houses in rural parts of the state.\n\nThe benefit would not only be to encourage young people to look at rural places to live and work and raise a family, but it would improve their financial profile in order to get a bank loan, he said, adding that he was inspired by corporations who offer loan forgiveness incentives when hiring, which they've found to be effective recruiting tools.\n\nOther communities have developed similar programs, such as Marquette, Kansas, which offers free land to people who agree to build a house in the rural town. And there are also loan forgiveness programs for health care professionals such as nurses who agree to work in rural areas.\n\nEverything should be on the table in order to address this challenge, Dunne said.
Thomas S. Monson, the president of the Mormon church -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- died late Tuesday at the age of 90, the church announced.\n\nPresident @ThomasSMonson, 90, has passed away peacefully surrounded by family. pic.twitter.com/66qoVrinIW — The LDS Church (@LDSchurch) January 3, 2018\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune notes that, During Monson's nearly 10-year tenure … Mormonism faced some of the most intense public scrutiny in its history -- from a divisive vote over gay marriage to high-profile Mormon candidacies for president and a hotly debated policy for same-sex couples and their children. Still, the private prophet stayed largely behind the scenes, showing up unexpectedly at funerals, comforting the bereaved, visiting the sick and, before her death, caring for his wife, Frances.\n\nCBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports the church issued a statement saying Monson died at 10:01 pm in his home in Salt Lake City. He was with family at the time of his passing. He died at age 90 from causes incident to age. President Monson ... leaves behind a legacy of service and good works. A successor is not expected to be formally chosen by the Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until after President Monson's funeral.\n\nProminent Utah figures were quick to tweet tributes. Among them:\n\nPresident Monson was among the greatest men I have ever known. Service was his motto and humility his hallmark. Countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. Today, I join millions across the globe in mourning his passing. #LDSChurch #utpol — Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) January 3, 2018\n\nMy heart is filled with love for Pres. Monson. He touched countless lives, including my own, in a positive and sweet manner influencing good throughout the world. https://t.co/cXnZswmZP3 — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) January 3, 2018\n\nFor more than 50 years, Monson served in top leadership councils for the church - making him a well-known face and personality to multiple generations of Mormons.\n\nA church bishop at the age of 22, the Salt Lake City native became the youngest church apostle ever in 1963 at the age of 36. He served as a counselor for three church presidents before assuming the role of the top leader of the church in February 2008.\n\nMonson's job is expected to go to next longest-tenured member of the church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Russell M. Nelson, per church protocol.\n\nMonson's presidency was marked by his noticeably low profile during a time of intense publicity for the church, including the 2008 and 2012 campaigns of Mormon Mitt Romney for U.S. president. Monson's most public acts were appearances at church conferences and devotionals as well as dedications of church temples.\n\nMonson will also be remembered for his emphasis on humanitarian work; leading the faith's involvement in the passage of gay marriage ban in California in 2008; continuing the religion's push to be more transparent about its past; and lowering the minimum age for missionaries.\n\nMormons considered Monson a warm, caring, endearing and approachable leader, said Patrick Mason, associate professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University in California. He was known for dropping everything to make hospital visits to people in need. His speeches at the faith's twice-yearly conferences often focused on parables of human struggles resolved through faith.\n\nHe put an emphasis on the humanitarian ethic of Mormons, evidenced by his expansion of the church's disaster relief programs around the world, said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University.\n\nMonson often credited his mother, Gladys Condie Monson, for fostering his compassion. He said that during his childhood in the Depression of the 1930s their house in Salt Lake City was known to hobos riding the railroads as a place to get a meal and a kind word.\n\nPresident Monson always seemed more interested in what we do with our religion rather than in what we believe, Mauss said.\n\nA World War II veteran, Monson served in the Navy and spent a year overseas before returning to get a business degree at the University of Utah and a master's degree in business administration from the church-owned Brigham Young University.\n\nBefore being tabbed to join the faith's church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Monson worked for the church's secular businesses, primarily in advertising, printing and publishing including the Deseret Morning News.\n\nMonson married Frances Beverly Johnson in 1948. The couple had three children, eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Frances died in 2013 at the age of 85.\n\nThroughout his life, Monson was an avid fisherman who also raised homing pigeons, specifically, roller pigeons who twirled as they flew. He was known for his love of show tunes, Boy Scouts and the Utah Jazz.\n\nMonson's legacy will be tied to the religion's efforts to hold tight to its opposition of same-sex marriage while encouraging members to be more open and compassionate toward gays and lesbians as acceptance for LGBT people increased across the county.\n\nAt Monson's urging, Mormons were vigorous campaign donors and volunteers in support of a measure to ban gay marriage in California in 2008. That prompted a backlash against the church that included vandalism of church buildings, protest marches and demonstrations outside church temples nationwide.\n\nIn subsequent years, the church began utilizing a softer tone on the issue. In 2015, the church backed an anti-discrimination law in Utah that gave unprecedented protections for gay and transgender people while also protecting religious freedoms.\n\nBut the religion came under fire again in the fall of 2015 when it banned baptisms for children living with gay parents, and instituted a requirement that those children disavow homosexual relationships before being allowed to serve a mission. The changes were designed to avoid putting children in a tug-of-war between their parents and church teachings, leaders said.\n\nThe revisions triggered anger, confusion and sadness for a growing faction of LGBT-supportive Mormons who were buoyed in recent years by church leaders' calls for more love and understanding for LGBT members.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of Monson's tenure came in October 2012, when he announced at church conference that the minimum age to depart on missions was being lowered to 19 from 21 for women; and to 18 from 19 for men. The change triggered a historic influx of missionaries, and proved a milestone change for women by allowing many more to serve.\n\nTaking the lead from Hinckley, Monson also continued the church's push toward being more open about some of the most sensitive aspect of the faith's history and doctrine. A renovated church history museum reopened in 2015 with an exhibit acknowledging the religion's early polygamous practices, a year after the church published an essay that for the first time chronicled founder Joseph Smith's plural wives.\n\nOther church essays issued during Monson's tenure addressed other sensitive topics: sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons are taught they will get their own planet in the afterlife.\n\nThe growth and globalization of the religion continued under Monson, with membership swelling to nearly 15.9 million, with more than half outside the United States.\n\nThe Mormon church was founded in 1830 in upstate New York by Joseph Smith, who claimed he was visited by God and Jesus while praying in a grove of trees and was called to found the church. Members are known as Mormons because of the religion's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nMormons believe they are called to share the word of God, specifically their own message of the restored Gospel, through their missionaries. There were 71,000 church missionaries serving around the world at the end of 2016.\n\nLike his predecessors, Monson traveled the world, visiting countless countries to give speeches, dedicate temples and preach to Latter-day Saints. Under his watch, 27 new temples were planned or built.\n\nMonson chose five new members to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a top-governing body that sets policy and runs the worldwide faith's business operations. All five were white and from Utah - a fact that disappointed some Mormons who wanted to see a minority or person from outside the U.S. selected to acknowledge the globalization of the church.\n\nThe man expected to take Monson's seat, the 93-year-old Nelson, has been a church apostle since April 1970. Out of respect for Monson, his appointment will not be officially named until after his funeral services.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Nelson will choose two new counselors from the Quorum of the Twelve who will join him to form a three-person presidency that is the top of the religion's governing hierarchy. Monson's two counselors were Henry Eyring and Dieter Uchtdorf. They will go back to being regular members of the Quorum unless they are chosen again.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church appointed a 93-year-old former heart surgeon Tuesday as its new president, following a longstanding succession plan that aims to keep the faith on course with a minimum of upheaval.\n\nThe selection of Russell M. Nelson was announced during an address broadcast from Salt Lake City to Mormons around the world. Nelson called on Mormons to stay true to their faith and keep the covenant path.\n\nIf you have stepped off the path, may I advise you with all the hope in my heart to please come back, Nelson said. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there's a place for you in this, the Lord's church.\n\nThe announcement came after Nelson was chosen as the religion's 17th president during a private meeting of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles leadership body in a temple, per church tradition that makes the longest-tenured member of the Quorum the new president. Nelson is now considered a prophet, seer and revelator by Mormons. Nelson succeeds Thomas S. Monson, who died Jan. 2 at age 90.\n\nNelson announced that his two counselors will be Dallin H. Oaks, 85, and Henry B. Eyring, 84, both members of the Quorum. Eyring was also a counselor for Monson, while this marks the first time Oaks will serve as a counselor to a church president. Oaks is the next-longest tenured member of the Quorum, making him next-in-line to become the next president.\n\nMembers of the media watch as Russell M. Nelson speaks via television from the historic Mormon Salt Lake Temple after being announced as the 17th president of the Mormon Church on Jan. 16, 2017, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Getty\n\nNelson is the second-oldest man to assume leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based in Utah and counts nearly 16 million members worldwide. He will oversee the religious and business interests of the faith in collaboration with two top counselors and members of the Quorum, one of the faith's top governing bodies.\n\nNelson's record during his three decades in church leadership suggests he will make few changes as he upholds church teaching and seeks to draw new members.\n\nAmong the challenges he faces is adapting to the increasingly global nature of the church, which was founded in 1830 in the United States and now has nearly six in 10 members living in other countries.\n\nStill, the rate of growth overall in membership has slowed in the past few decades, despite efforts to spread the faith including the lowering of the minimum age for those serving as missionaries.\n\nNelson takes the top position amid increased scrutiny of church teaching in the internet age, which has made more information on doctrine available. Under Monson, leaders released a series of essays explaining some controversial areas of Mormon history, including early polygamous practices and a past ban on black men in the lay clergy.\n\nThe church also faces some pressure to allow greater leadership roles for women, including those who want to be admitted to the priesthood.\n\nNelson also will have to navigate the issues raised by the LGBT rights movement. The church, at times, has expressed empathy and told members to be welcoming to LGBT people while also strictly defending opposition to same-sex marriage and all homosexual relationships.\n\nLast year, Mormon leaders partially cut ties with the Boy Scouts of America, which in 2015 ended its blanket ban on participation by openly gay adults. The LDS church, which has been the biggest sponsor of troops, said the move wasn't about that decision.\n\nNelson fits the common profile of his generation of church leaders as someone who was successful in the private sector before leaving behind his career to help guide the faith.\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City in 1924, Nelson converted to Mormonism at the age of 16. He was a doctor by 22. He served a two-year Army medical tour of duty during the Korean War before resuming a medical career that included being director of thoracic surgery residency at the University of Utah.\n\nNelson learned Mandarin after church president Spencer W. Kimball challenged church leaders in 1979 to learn the language. The next year, Nelson spent a month in Jinan, China, working with doctors there as a visiting professor of surgery.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, he joined the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe final surgery Nelson performed was the next year in China, when he operated on Chinese opera star Fang Rongxiang at the request of a doctor who knew and trusted Nelson, according to a church biography.\n\nNelson was scheduled to answer questions from reporters later Tuesday morning.\n\nHis past speeches offer some clue to how he will lead.\n\nIn October 2015, during a period of intense discussion about the role of women, Nelson spoke of women's unique contributions.\n\nMy dear sisters, whatever your calling, whatever your circumstances, we need your impressions, your insights, and your inspiration, Nelson said. Married or single, you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from God. We brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence.\n\nThat year, when the U.S. legalized same-sex marriage, Mormon leaders declared people in same-sex relationships apostates, meaning they could be excommunicated, and banned baptism for children living with gay parents until the children reached age 18. The policy caused an uproar among gay rights activists within and outside the church. Nelson told a group of young adults in 2016 that the rules came from a revelation received by Monson and other leaders that gave spiritual confirmation for their stance.\n\nLast October, in an address to the church general conference, Nelson implored members to closely read and understand the faith's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nWhen I think of the Book of Mormon, I think of the word power, Nelson said. The truths of the Book of Mormon have the power to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls.
Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg says he would pay more to Uncle Sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. What the former New York City mayor hasn't said: He'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. Bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.\n\nBloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. That includes him: Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nMuch of that fortune is tied to Bloomberg LLC, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. The candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant Douglas Taylor. And his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.\n\nBloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. But that's not unique. All of the major Democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nWhat's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, Bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. For instance, Bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans lowered it in late 2017. (Rivals like Pete Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren would like to roll back Mr. Trump's corporate tax cut completely.) That 2017 corporate-rate change saved Bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.\n\nBloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates.\n\nWe don't have nor discuss Mike's personal financials, a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. Mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released.\n\nThe Bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. Here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about Bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other Democratic candidates have proposed, including Sanders and Warren as well as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBloomberg plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.\n\nHow it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.\n\nBloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the IRS to put in place, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.\n\nCurrently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. Bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. He calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.\n\nBloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under President Barack Obama. That would bring the highest income tax rate under Bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. That's still less than Sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.\n\nHow many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.\n\nRoughly 11,000 Americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the Social Security Administration. Include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.\n\nAs of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. So the number is likely somewhere between those two.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.\n\nBased on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.\n\nSanders plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under Sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.\n\nHow it would work: Sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. After that, it gets complicated.\n\nSanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. Tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.\n\nThe advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. For instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas.\n\nHow many people would pay the wealth tax: The Sanders wealth tax would likely affect more Americans than those who would pay Bloomberg's surcharge. The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That's about 40,000 more households than Bloomberg's wealth tax.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: The Sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. Penn Wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.\n\nWarren plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under Warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.\n\nHow it would work: Warren's plan, like Sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. But her blueprint is simpler.\n\nThere are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes.\n\nHow many people would pay: The Warren campaign, as well as economists Saez and Zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. But another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay Warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money Warren says it could.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.\n\nBiden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.\n\nHow their plans would work: Neither Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg nor Amy Klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. Of the three, only Klobuchar has said she is open to one. Buttigieg called Warren's wealth tax extreme.\n\nIn fact, Biden and Buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like Bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. Klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.\n\nInstead, and like Bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. That would hit the rich more than average Americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, IRAs and other pre-tax retirement plans.\n\nThe candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before President Trump took office. That would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.\n\nHow many people would pay more tax: The Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all Americans, not just the super wealthy.\n\nAs of 2017, some 1.4 million American households had annual income of more than $500,000. Nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.\n\nHow much government revenue they would raise: Penn Wharton has said Biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. But that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. About half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to Penn Wharton's calculations.\n\nThe Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. Neither campaign responded to comment for this article.\n\nEditor's note: CBS MoneyWatch Senior Reporter Stephen Gandel is a former employee of Bloomberg LLC.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said that candidate Mike Bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. In fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%.
Shares slid Wednesday in Europe after a day of gains in Asia as attention turned to minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve. U.S. stock index futures fell in pre-market trading, following a sell-off on Tuesday.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX slipped 0.5 percent to 12,432.70 and the CAC 40 of France lost 0.5 percent to 5,265.04. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.2 percent to 7,234.56. Dow futures edged 0.1 percent lower to 24,933.00 and S&P 500 futures also were down 0.1 percent at 2,712.50, pointing to losses on the open in New York.\n\nASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.2 percent to 21,970.81 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.8 percent to 31,431.89. Australia's S&P ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent higher to 5,943.70 and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.6 percent to 2,429.65. India's Sensex gained 0.3 percent to 33,801.94 while shares in Southeast Asia were mixed. Markets in mainland China were closed for a final day of lunar new year holidays.\n\nWALL STREET: Walmart's stock sank 10 percent on Tuesday, its biggest drop in 30 years, after the retailer reported fourth-quarter results that missed Wall Street's expectations as its e-commerce sales in the U.S. slowed. The late sell-off erased early gains led by technology companies. Grocery store operators, retailers, health care companies and industrial stocks accounted for much of the market's slide.\n\nFED WATCH: Investors have been bracing for signs the U.S. central bank might tighten monetary policy in minutes from its Jan. 30-31 policy meeting due out Wednesday. Jitters over inflation remain after the spate of volatility earlier this month.\n\nBONDS LOOMING: Adding to the risks, the rising yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, is making bonds more appealing than stocks. It has been rising in recent months from a low of 2.04 percent in September. On Wednesday it was at 2.89 percent. Some of the broader concerns on investors' minds right now are looking across to the bond market and seeing the 10-year Treasury starting to approach that 3 percent level, said Bill Northey, vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nJAPAN MANUFACTURING: Preliminary results from a survey of manufacturers in February showed indicators at their strongest level since early 2014. The Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers index) was at 54 on a 0-100 scale where reading exceeding 50 indicate expansion. Job creation hit an 11-year high. Export growth slowed from January's peak but remained solid, Bernard Aw, principle economist for IHS Markit said in the report.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 67 cents to $61.12 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 24 cents to settle at $61.79 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 72 cents to $64.53 per barrel. It gained 42 cents to close at $65.25 a barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 107.64 yen from 107.33 yen on Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.2316 from $1.2337.
Sacramento, Calif. - The announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s problems squarely in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink California's energy picture in the face of climate change.\n\nThis issue is all about three fundamental things: It is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, Newsom told reporters Monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.\n\nEarlier in the day, PG&E announced it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. The announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. Newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.\n\nWe'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. I respect the taxpayer, I respect the ratepayer and I'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.\n\nThe filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. It would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.\n\nThe chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat.\n\nHow much and what the state can do remains to be seen. Lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened PG&E bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. Democratic Assemblyman Chris Holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on Monday he said he has backed off that idea.\n\nClearly PG&E has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about PG&E's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.\n\nIn a Tuesday morning note, Height Securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for PG&E's complex problems. As of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.\n\nClimate change makes matters worse\n\n\n\nPG&E serves about 40 percent of California's utility customers, Newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. It operates in three-quarters of California's land most vulnerable to wildfires, Newsom said. While PG&E's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending California's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.\n\nState officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a November blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. But no one has yet figured out the future of California energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jerry Hill said a PG&E bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. Hill represents San Bruno in the San Francisco Bay Area, where a PG&E natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.\n\nThis company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.\n\nOnly viable option\n\n\n\nNewsom agreed PG&E hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. He noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including Chief Executive Geisha Williams, who resigned on Sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.\n\nChapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, Richard Kelly, chairman of PG&E's board of directors, said in a statement.\n\nThe Chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.\n\nRegardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, PG&E customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for PG&E's clean energy initiatives, which are key to California's environmental goals. PG&E is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the NRDC's Ralph Cavanagh.\n\nThe bankruptcy is different from PG&E's bankruptcy in 2001, when California faced an energy crisis that caused power outages. Newsom said the state has an abundance of energy and power shutoffs are not imminent.
The White House Office of Management and Budget violated the law when it withheld military aid from Ukraine, according to the Government Accountability Office. In its decision released Thursday, the federal watchdog agency concluded that the funds were frozen to align with President Trump's policy priorities.\n\nFaithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, reads the agency's decision. [The Office of Management and Budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.\n\nThe OMB argues that the Ukraine freeze was not subject to the ICA because it constituted a programmatic delay, that hinged on a policy development, according to the report. The GAO contends that that argument has no basis in law.\n\nProgrammatic delays occur when an agency is taking necessary steps to implement a program, but because of factors external to the program, funds temporarily go unobligated, the GAO explains in its report. Here, there was no external factor causing an unavoidable delay. Rather, OMB on its own volition explicitly barred DOD from obligating amounts.\n\nAccording to GAO General Counsel Thomas H. Armstrong, the White House OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.'\n\nThe President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Armstrong said in a statement regarding its decision. ... The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.\n\nCounselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, confronted with the GAO's findings moments after they were released, said she hadn't had a chance to read the report but she was very glad that Ukraine got the aid, and got it within the deadline.\n\nPressed further on the report's findings, Conway emphasized that Ukraine did receive the aid, and Mr. Trump wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than aid was under his predecessor.\n\nWell then it's a good thing that the aid that Congress approved got to Ukraine intact and it got there because this president released it, Conway said. And he wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than it was under President Obama so that they can protect themselves against foreign aggression.\n\nThe GAO — an independent watchdog that provides information and legal analysis to Congress on executive activity — concluded that the White House OMB was unauthorized to withhold the approximately $214 million in military aid from Ukraine in Summer 2019. Congress had already appropriated $250 million to the Department of Defense for security assistance to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019.\n\nThe funds were intended to provide Ukraine with training; equipment; lethal assistance; logistics support, supplies and services; sustainment; and intelligence support as they defend themselves against their neighbor, and aggressor, Russia.\n\nAccording to GAO's report, the OMB withheld the funds by making the money unavailable for obligation, effectively pausing its availability to the DOD.\n\nGAO also reported that that the OMB and the State Department did not provide them with all the documentation requested in their investigation. Specifically, GAO notes that the agencies provided them with very little information on foreign military financing over a period of six days in August 2019.\n\nWe consider a reluctance to provide a fulsome response to have constitutional significance, reads the GAO's decision. ... All federal officials and employees take an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution and its core tenets, including the congressional power of the purse.\n\nThe GAO said it will renew its request for information from the State Department and OMB. We will continue to pursue this matter.\n\n— Kathryn Watson contributed to this report
Arizona and Uber kept the company's testing of self-driving cars in the state out of the spotlight for months, according to a report in the Guardian.\n\nThat is, until a self-driving car in Arizona crashed into a woman crossing the road in a Phoenix suburb and killed her, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended the testing of autonomous vehicles in his state.\n\nNeither Uber, nor the State of Arizona had a legal obligation to inform the public about the testing, under Arizona law. And Ducey did sign an executive order in August 2015 allowing the testing of autonomous vehicles in the state.\n\nBut emails obtained by the Guardian under public records laws show reveal a consistent working relationship between Uber and Ducey's office.\n\nUber representatives and Ducey first met a month after Ducey was sworn into office in 2015, according to the Guardian. In April 2015, Ducey signed legislation authorizing ride-sharing in the state in a high-profile appearance.\n\nA few months later, Ducey had a press conference with Uber announcing the company's $25,000 gift to the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences. Uber claimed it would base a fleet of cars out of the university. The same day, Aug. 25, 2015, Ducey issued an executive order allowing for the testing of autonomous cars with human drivers in the car as a safety precaution.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber's communications director Taylor Patterson asked Ducey's office to tweet about Uber Eats' arrival in his state. Ducey did so the following day.\n\nJust before Uber began testing the autonomous cars in August 2016, Uber's head of public policy, Ashwini Chabra, informed Ducey's deputy chief of staff that the testing was about to begin, and asked him to send someone discreet to give the Phoenix police department a heads up, according to the emails the Guardian obtained.\n\nDucey's office said it is categorically false that Uber's testing was a secret. Ptak pointed to multiple news stories from 2016 about such autonomous vehicle testing in Arizona.\n\nThe allegation that any company began testing autonomous vehicle technology in Arizona 'in secret' is categorically false, Patrick Ptak, spokesman for Ducey's office, told CBS News.  ... Arizona has been very public about the testing and operation of self-driving cars -- it has been anything but a secret. The governor has also demonstrated he will hold companies accountable when necessary, as his letter to Uber this week indicates.\n\nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
(CNN) —\n\nTwo House millennials on opposite sides of the political spectrum have proved it's possible to find common ground, at least when it comes to cannabis policy.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently tapped Dan Riffle, a former federal policy director at the Marijuana Policy Project, as a senior counsel and policy adviser. When she tweeted out a story about the hire from High Times, she added, #LegalizeIt, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the War on Drugs.\n\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida retweeted her and added, You had me at hello.\n\nYou had me at hello. https://t.co/LqgYnl6rHl — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) January 10, 2019\n\nThat a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the Trumpiest congressman in Trump's Washington by GQ might have something to do with their ages. Millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 Pew poll. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and Gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.\n\nAnd although Democrats have led Republicans when it comes to backing legalization, Republican support has grown. In 2017 a Gallup poll found a majority of Republicans supported legalization for the first time. As of October 2018, 75% of Democrats, 71% of independents and 53% of Republicans supported legalization, per Gallup.\n\nGaetz represents the shift in his party. In 2018, he and Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts teamed up on legislation that would require the Veterans Affairs Department to survey veterans on marijuana use and protect the benefits of veterans who disclose their marijuana use to VA doctors.\n\nGaetz also backed the Medical Cannabis Research Act, the first such legislation related to marijuana ever considered by a Republican-led Judiciary Committee, his office said.\n\nThis drug should not be in the same category as heroin and LSD, and we do not need to continue with a policy that turns thousands of young people into felons every year, Gaetz said in 2017. Nor do we need to punish the millions of people who are sick and seeking medical help – from pain, from muscle wasting, from chemotherapy-induced nausea.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner also came out in support of weed. The Ohio Republican was opposed while he was the speaker, but last April he took a role on the board of advisers for Acreage Holdings, a cannabis company, and has spoken at cannabis investment events.\n\nThough Republicans like Gaetz might be rare in Congress now, should his party continue to evolve on cannabis policy, issues like medical marijuana, the war on drugs and legalization could one day become more bipartisan.

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\n\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\n\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\n\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\n\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\n\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\n\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\n\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\n\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries. It hasn't happened.\n\nIt is time to admit there is no sensible agenda, policy or plan for the working or middle class to thrive in Trump's America. Once we do, we'll be better able to focus our energy on identifying a leader who prioritizes all of us.
(CNN) As I wrote this, the US Capitol building was being stormed by violent right-wing protestors trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThis was an attempted coup, encouraged by the President of the United States, in an attempt to derail today's congressional certification of the electoral vote that will lead to Joe Biden's inauguration in two weeks.\n\nDonald Trump's legacy is American carnage. Our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. His misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. Trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. His rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently. Now we are all reaping what they've sown, as the President watches it all burn from within the White House. But then, there are some men who want to ruin if they cannot rule.\n\nMake no mistake: this is sedition. And it's coming at the hands of self-styled super-patriots who have been amped up by the President's lies about non-existent mass voter fraud to excuse losing a free and fair election by a large margin.\n\nThey are not conservatives -- they are radicals. Because patriots don't break the windows of the US Capitol building and storm inside when they lose an election. No hostile foreign power has done more damage to what President-elect Joe Biden called  the citadel of our democracy  since an invading British army burned down the Capitol in the War of 1812 . But certainly, the enemies of democracy have taken great comfort from their actions today.\n\nWe are still in the fog of war. But some things are clear. The politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this President's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. The Republican members of Congress -- like Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. So is Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a Save America rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.\n\nThere is no reasoning with conspiracy theorists. There is no negotiating with extremists. The President's lies unleashed this mob. Responsible Republicans need to condemn it clearly -- or own it forever.\n\nIt's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to Black Lives Matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . Folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. That's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. If they'd been Black or left wing or Muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the President and his allies would have been deafening.\n\nThe mask has come off. The calls for law and order were really about race. The calls for respecting our democratic traditions apparently apply only to elections that Republicans win. The partisan divisions in our country are not about policy or even ideology anymore. It's now about whether you believe in facts and science and even democracy itself. This is what happens when hyper-partisans indulge extremism, lies and conspiracy theories for political expediency.\n\nWhile the Capitol building has been ransacked, left undiscussed is the fact that we just marked the deadliest day of the Covid-19 pandemic -- adding to the more than 350,000 Americans who have died because of Trump's denialism and misrule. This is also a mark of Trump's American carnage. He is unable to discharge the duties of the presidency without always thinking about himself first. That's why he couldn't bring himself to clearly and immediately condemn this violence. No wonder there are renewed calls -- even from some conservatives like John Podhoretz at Commentary -- to impeach and remove President Trump from office. There is certainly cause even if there is not time.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Character is indeed destiny: his years of divisive lies, corruption and incompetence have led to sedition and violence. It is an urgent reminder that hate can never be channeled into something constructive. Golem always ultimately turns on its creator.

Explore the behind-the-scenes drama that gave rise to some of the most influential American leaders on CNN Original Series Race for the White House, Sundays at 10p ET.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe 2020 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is perhaps the craziest, most controversial election in US history.\n\nWe say perhaps because we don't want to bog you down with superlatives when there have been so many truly zany moments in American elections.\n\nWho could forget Howard Dean screaming like he'd lost a limb, or Rick Perry forgetting one of the three federal agencies he'd cut if elected?\n\nThen there's the bevy of oh-so-colorful characters, from Jello Biafra, Joan Jett Blakk and Wavy Gravy to Lee Mercer, Jack Shepard and Lyndon LaRouche. Did we mention Deez Nuts?\n\nTo say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn't objective. Sure, Trump has claimed victory despite Biden's projected win, questioned the voting system's integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than Congress picking a president? That's happened a few times.\n\nWe'll let you decide. So, without any superlatives, here are 11 fascinating elections in American history:\n\n1800: Prelude to a duel\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images Vice President Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804.\n\nThe outcome of the 1800 contest between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams was so bizarre, the United States had to amend the Constitution.\n\nPre-12th Amendment, Electoral College members each had two votes for president, and there were no official tickets. Whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency.\n\nThough problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw Jefferson tie with his Democratic-Republican running mate Aaron Burr. Both had 73 votes to Adams'$2 65.\n\nCongress would be called upon to break the tie. Enter Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first treasury secretary, founder of the Federalist Party and a man who did not care for Adams, Jefferson or Burr.\n\nNonetheless, Hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the Federalists to vote for Jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that Mr. Burr loves nothing but himself – thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\n\nThe House of Representatives didn't easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name Jefferson the victor and Burr the veep on February 7, 1801.\n\nMaking the election all the zanier, the rivalry between Burr and Hamilton would continue for more than three years before Burr, still the sitting vice president, killed Hamilton in a duel.\n\n1824: 'Corrupt bargain'\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images Andrew Jackson called the 1824 election the corrupt bargain and promised to win in 1828.\n\nThis one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the Federalist Party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were Democratic-Republicans.\n\nAndrew Jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 Electoral College votes. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams secured 84, Treasury Secretary William Crawford won 41 and House Speaker Henry Clay had 37.\n\nWith no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the House again had to settle the deadlock, and Jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and Electoral College. Because the House could choose among only three candidates, Clay got the boot.\n\nWe mentioned Clay was speaker, yes?\n\nWell, after a month of horse trading, many of Clay's supporters shifted their support to Adams, who would go on to win the majority of the House vote. Maryland, Illinois and Louisiana, which had cast most of their Electoral College votes for Jackson, as well as Kentucky, where Adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back Adams.\n\nAfter his inauguration, Adams selected Clay as his secretary of state. Jackson was furious and accused Adams and Clay of a corrupt bargain. He vacated his Senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a Washington outsider.\n\nBacked by his new party, the Democrats, Jackson made good on the promise, besting Adams, who by then was a leader in the National Republican Party.\n\n1860: Nation divided\n\nPHOTO: N. Spindler/Library of Congress A crowd gathers for the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln on March 4, 1861.\n\nThis election wasn't particularly close. Abraham Lincoln trounced John Breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time.\n\nNo, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant Democratic Party – and thereby, the nation – in half.\n\nThe Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all U.S. territories, had laid the battleground: The Republican Party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the Democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery.\n\nAt a second convention that year, the Democrats nominated Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, but many Southerners in the party defected and selected Breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. Both would claim to be the official Democratic candidate.\n\nThe Constitutional Union Party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected Sen. John Bell of Tennessee.\n\nThe Electoral College vote told the story. Lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College took most of the North, along with California and Oregon. Douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only Missouri (and three votes in New Jersey). Breckinridge took most of the South, along with Maryland and Delaware, and Bell's middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia.\n\nWeeks after the election, South Carolina voted to secede, followed by six more Southern states. In February 1861, delegates from those states formed the Confederate States of America and selected Jefferson Davis as their president.\n\nIn April, a South Carolina militia would take Fort Sumter, and four more states would join the Confederacy.\n\n1872: Death of a candidate\n\nPHOTO: MPI/Getty Images Ulysses S. Grant attended Horace Greeley's funeral after his rival died before the Electoral College vote.\n\nSet aside that 1872 was the year suffragette Victoria Woodhull of the People's Party became the first woman to run for president. Also, forget that writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, her running mate, was the first African-American to be considered for the vice presidency. And never mind this was the year Susan B. Anthony would be arrested for illegal voting.\n\nNo, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final Electoral College vote.\n\nHorace Greeley wasn't supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat President Ulysses S. Grant, but a schism in Grant's Republican Party made things a little more interesting.\n\nGrant, who led the Union armies that defeated the Confederacy, had not been so convincing in the Oval Office. The White House website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his puzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\n\nSome Republicans defected, becoming Liberal Republicans, and cast their lot with Greeley, a Democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election.\n\nBefore the Electoral College could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died November 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among Thomas Hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other Democrats.\n\nGrant attended his rival's funeral.\n\n1876: Not-so-independent tiebreaker\n\nPHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images Rutherford B. Hayes' election as president also marked the end of Reconstruction in the South.\n\nDemocrat Samuel Tilden had beaten Republican Rutherford Hayes. He snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProblem was, Tilden was one Electoral College vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes – Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon – were disputing the results. In the Southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud.\n\nWith no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and an independent.\n\nThe independent, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the Illinois Legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was replaced by Justice Joseph Bradley, a diehard Republican who would cast every vote for Hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority.\n\nDemocrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if Hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the South under Reconstruction.\n\nHayes was sworn in March 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. Reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress African Americans had made. It would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in Congress.\n\n1920: Prison campaign\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images Eugene Debs ran for president five times, the final time from the most unlikely of headquarters.\n\nIt was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn't terribly exciting. Republican Warren G. Harding handed Democrat James Cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states.\n\nThird place is where it got interesting.\n\nLong before Bernie Sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the Socialist Party of America enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. That union leader Eugene Debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots.\n\nIn 1920, though, Debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison.\n\nNo stranger to incarceration – he'd served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike – Debs again drew the government's ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he pilloried the ruling class who made all the decisions to send the working class to war.\n\nYours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die, he said.\n\nHe was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the May Day riots of 1919, and Debs was later moved to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign.\n\nHe would again secure more than 900,000 votes – an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with Harding, who snared more than 16 million.\n\nThe following year, on Christmas, Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served.\n\n1948: Ultimate 'whoops' moment\n\nPHOTO: Underwood Archives/Getty Images Harry Truman holds up the Chicago Daily Tribune with a headline of his defeat to Thomas Dewey in 1948.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman was done before the election began. You could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. The election was New York Gov. Thomas Dewey's. Period.\n\nThe 1946 midterms had handed both houses to Republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three Americans approved of Truman's handling of the presidency.\n\nMaking matters worse, Truman's commerce secretary, Henry Wallace, had revolted over the administration's foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate.\n\nSouthern Democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the States' Rights Party – aka the Dixiecrats – and electing segregationist South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond as their candidate.\n\nThe final pre-election Gallup poll – interestingly, taken in mid-October and not released until the day before Election Day – showed Dewey beating Truman by 5 percentage points.\n\nEven on Election Day, Truman recalled an NBC report predicting he would lose. It wasn't until 4 a.m. that his Secret Service agents woke him to say he had won.\n\nThe Chicago Daily Tribune had referred to Truman as a nincompoop on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. Poetically, a printers' strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and Publisher J. Loy Maloney took the pollsters' word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history.\n\nDewey defeats Truman.\n\n1960: Dawn of televised debates\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images Candidates John F. Kennedy, left, and Richard Nixon exchange smiles ahead of their first TV debate.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. He was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. He was also the first Catholic president.\n\nThe contest between Kennedy and Richard Nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into American living rooms.\n\nThis was important to the vote's outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the American household. Eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950.\n\nNixon had recently been hospitalized. He refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. He had a 5 o'clock shadow. He wore a gray suit that blended into the background. His appearance left much to be desired, historians would note.\n\nKennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. Unlike Nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent.\n\nThe estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on September 26, 1960, felt Kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt Nixon was the victor.\n\nOn November 8, Kennedy edged out Nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million).\n\nThough it's arguable that the debate alone won Kennedy the election (he also secured the African-American vote by offering his assistance in getting the Rev. Martin Luther Jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns.\n\nTelevised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate.\n\n1964: Mandate on race\n\nPHOTO: National Archives/Newsmakers Lyndon B. Johnson prevailed in the 1964 presidential election, a contest dominated by race\n\nThis is the election that brought us the Daisy ad – an attempt to paint Republican Barry Goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country's nuclear arsenal. The ad remains haunting even amid today's supercharged mudslinging.\n\nThe summer of 1964 brought the Civil Rights Act. Angry Whites protested the legislation across the South, while Blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and other cities.\n\nThe stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether Goldwater or President Lyndon Johnson was a more capable commander in chief. Race would not only shape 1964's ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come.\n\nAlabama's fiery segregationist Gov. George Wallace took on Johnson for the Democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that white backlash against the Civil Rights Act was a Southern thing, Wallace received more than 30% of the vote in Wisconsin and Indiana and more than 40% in Maryland in the primaries.\n\nWallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both Goldwater and Johnson substantial concerns. Goldwater feared Wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and Johnson worried about Wallace's strong showing in non-Southern states.\n\nWhile Goldwater, who had cast his vote against the Civil Rights Act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, Johnson tried to please everyone.\n\nThat was most evident when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Black activists organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because Mississippi had run a segregated primary.\n\nJohnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. He would later anger many in the South by selecting Hubert Humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate.\n\nJohnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. Goldwater won only his home state of Arizona and Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. Republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the South to this day.\n\n1972: Death (of a campaign) by electroshock therapy\n\nPHOTO: Photo by Anthony Korody/Getty Images Sen. George McGovern, right, and running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton during the 1972 campaign.\n\nIt happened in a hasty two-minute phone call.\n\nSen. George McGovern of South Dakota had just won the Democratic nomination for president and phoned Sen. Thomas Eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. Several high-profile Democrats had declined to join McGovern on the ticket, so he picked Eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the Catholic vote.\n\nTo say Eagleton didn't undergo the intense vetting of, say, Sarah Palin or Paul Ryan would be an understatement.\n\nHad McGovern grilled Eagleton according to today's standards, he might've learned Eagleton's secret: that the senator from Missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions.\n\nWhen rumors first began to surface, McGovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that Eagleton posed a liability.\n\nDuring a news conference at a South Dakota state park, where McGovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, Eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to McGovern.\n\nOn August 1 – 18 days after he was selected – Eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign.\n\nRichard Nixon would go on to obliterate McGovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the Democrat by about 18 million votes – thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket.
(CNN) As the US looks for ways to speed the administration of Covid-19 vaccines, some states and providers are pulling in non-traditional vaccinators, including dentists, retirees and students, to aid in the process.\n\nWith health care workers stretched thin responding to record numbers of coronavirus hospitalizations, jurisdictions are scrambling to find extra hands with the skills to help get shots into arms.\n\nA report released by the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and National Governors Association in December cited 20 states that are considering recruiting non-traditional providers, including students, dentists, veterinarians and paramedics.\n\nOn Monday, the California Department of Consumer Affairs approved an emergency waiver allowing dentists to administer Covid-19 vaccines. The move came as California Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state's plans to aggressively accelerate the pace of vaccination.\n\nThe American Dental Association says dentists are cleared to give the vaccine in multiple states, including Oregon, where the first dentist in the US to administer a Covid-19 vaccine did so last month.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nLike most successful candidates, President Donald Trump's rhetoric from the campaign trail now runs up awkwardly against the often dense and arcane language that fills more formal executive actions and memos.\n\nThe impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the Mexican border has been reduced, on White House stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border. Trump has kicked off his administration with a slew of aggressive actions, but it might be hard to tell from the reading.\n\nHere are a few examples of campaign technicolor translated into the black and white of legalistic, government documentation:\n\n1. In February 2016, Trump made this promise to a voter in New Hampshire.\n\nObamacare is a disaster and we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great.\n\nAs the administration and congressional Republicans now grapple with doing just that, Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to back off enforcing the law's mandate. Here's what it said:\n\nSec. 2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\n\n2. The construction of a wall – not a fence – on the US-Mexico border was a cornerstone of the Trump presidential bid. Appealing to voters, he led chants of build the wall and described the coming barrier like this during first rally:\n\nI will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\n\nIn the executive order Trump signed on Wednesday, he delivered the following, rather soberer instructions to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security:\n\n(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n\n(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n\n(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n\n(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\n\n3. Trump has also issued an executive order aimed at sanctuary cities. Back in September 2015, he told a rally in Dallas: We have to end this sanctuary cities crap. Later in the campaign, he made this declaration:\n\nBlock funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nAnd this is what it looked like on paper this week:\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n\n(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;\n\n(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;\n\n(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;\n\n(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and\n\n(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.\n\nHere's how his opposition to the deal sounded on the stump, at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, in June 2016:\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country – just a continuing rape of our country.\n\nAnd this is what the formal departure looked like in a presidential memorandum from January 23. This, after a preamble on the importance of trade and American jobs:\n\nBased on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages.\n\n5. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the Canadian oil sands to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, was blocked by the Obama administration in 2015. Trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. Here's what he said last January in Iowa:\n\nWhen they do the Keystone Pipeline – I want it approved, I want all those jobs – I like a lot of oil flow, because right now we're low.\n\nAnd here's what the announcement that Trump would re-open the process looked like in a presidential memo issued this week:
(CNN) LeBron James and the NBA community have expressed their disappointment after prosecutors decided not to charge any police officer in connection with the shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nJames, who has consistently used his platform to call for the end of police brutality, said the prosecutor's decision was a blow to the heart and to the gut.\n\nNot only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long, he told reporters after the LA Lakers' win over the Memphis Grizzlies in Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced Tuesday that no Kenosha law enforcement officer in this case will be charged with any criminal offense based on the facts and laws.\n\nRusten Sheskey, a White officer, shot Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back while responding to a domestic incident on August 23, 2020. Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRead More

Read her blog, So About What I Said, and follow her on Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe next time you report a Twitter troll for polluting your timeline, you might notice an additional word on the reporting form.\n\nDisability.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Melissa Blake Melissa Blake\n\nIt's just one word. One we've seen thousands of times before. In fact, if you weren't looking closely at the form in the frenetic moments of reporting a tweet, you might not even notice it.\n\nBut make no mistake: This change is no small feat. It's a long overdue win in what seemed like a never-ending battle, one that people with disabilities like myself have been fighting online for years. Thankfully, Twitter joined that fight earlier this month when it revised its reporting form to include hate directed at people with disabilities.\n\nIt's against our rules to directly attack or threaten someone based on their protected category, including disability, Twitter said in a tweet posted April 2. You asked us to clarify this in our reporting flow, and we've updated it to be more specific.\n\nThe change is thanks to Natalie Weaver, who called on Twitter to revise its reporting form after her daughter's photo was used in an offensive tweet promoting eugenics. Her daughter, Sophia, has Rett syndrome, a genetic brain disorder that affects such things as language, walking and coordination. At first, Weaver told the website The Mighty, Twitter refused to take down the tweet, but eventually changed course, removing the offending account entirely.\n\nThe message rang loud and clear: This sort of hateful, ableist content will not be tolerated; in fact, it has no place on the social media platform.\n\nAs Weaver told The Mighty: Many people with medical conditions and/or disabilities receive hate and harassment every day on Twitter and no violations are found. I am hopeful that this change will create a safer environment for people with medical conditions and disabilities.\n\nI've been on the receiving end of this damaging and destructive hate speech for years. I was born with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, a rare genetic bone and muscular disorder; it affects everything from my joints to my physical appearance. I've been called ugly, a monster, compared to a blob (picture of said blob included next to my profile picture) and in one particular tweet, which was the most stinging of all, one user suggested I was a thing and should be euthanized.\n\nThe only user to get the ban hammer? The one who said I should be euthanized. All the other accounts, Twitter told me, didn't violate the Twitter rules.\n\nI'm an accomplished freelance writer and blogger. But online, and especially on Twitter, I'm reduced to an object – literally, a thing to be mocked, ridiculed and shamed. My physical appearance is what those Twitter trolls pounce on. Immediately.\n\nMaybe they can sense that I've struggled with self-confidence surrounding my disability in the past? Maybe they figure it took me a while to come to terms with my disability (spoiler alert: It did)? Maybe they just know where to hit me to make it hurt just a little bit more? Or maybe they're just sad, pathetic people unhappy with themselves and their own life?\n\nI've asked myself these questions a lot, and, honestly, I'm not sure of the answers. But here's what I do know: All too often, people with disabilities are overlooked when it comes to these kinds of conversations about hate speech online.\n\nWhen we think of hate speech and what sorts of things constitute hate speech, we automatically think of racism and LGBTQ issues. What we don't automatically think of are things like ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities, which are rampant in society, to be sure, but sometimes get overlooked. Consider the flippant use of the R word – and even a seemingly less offensive word like cripple. Even Disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.\n\nThankfully, though, society's views about people with disabilities are changing, as evidenced not only by Twitter's change in policy, but also by Apple's plans to add 13 new disability-related emojis to its lineup. Everything from a cane to a hearing aid to a person zooming along in a wheelchair is just a starting point, Apple hinted recently, saying, Currently, emoji provide a wide range of options, but may not represent the experiences of those with disabilities.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDisabilities may make people uncomfortable. I'm sure my disability and my wheelchair has made people uncomfortable in the past. But that doesn't give people the right to use it against me and vilify me for it. Twitter's change in policy gives me hope. Hope that perhaps, finally, we've moved the needle of dismantling centuries of negative misconceptions surrounding people with disabilities. We're not monsters. We're people. And we're not going anywhere – on Twitter and in real life.

The deficit – or the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in over any one year – jumped to 3.8% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.5% in 2017.\n\nThat's particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures. If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\n\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\n\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\n\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2. According to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Treasury will be able to finance the government's operations until at least mid-summer by moving money around from different pots.
Women in traditional Korean dress head to the dance. Though much of North Korea is without electricity, the portraits of the supreme leaders are illuminated brightly.\n\nThis may look like an ordinary scene in any country, Huniewicz explains, but in North Korea, he feels it challenges a local song about no mother's love being greater than that of the Communist Party.\n\nThese settlements, captured from a speeding van, appear to be slums outside of Pyongyang, according to Huniewicz. He speculates that the tourist transport vans slow down when passing what the authorities are proud of showing and speed past less desirable sights.\n\nA woman sells postcards, stamps and posters, many featuring themes focused on defeating the U.S. and destroying the White House. Huniewicz says he did send one such postcard from North Korea to the U.S. and it arrived with no problems.\n\nWho's American here? the museum guide asks. Grab the flowers, go to the monument, bow, and lay the flowers there. Huniewicz says North Koreans told him they single-handedly defeated the U.S. in the Korean War.\n\nNorth Koreans head down to the Pyongyang Metro. It's 100 meters underground thus riding the escalator down to the station takes a couple of minutes.\n\nHuniewicz says this is just one of two photos in which he was able to capture a candid smile from local residents.\n\nLondon-based amateur photographer Michal Huniewicz recently visited North Korea as a tourist. He snapped dozens of images during his trip -- some permitted, others not. Huniewicz took this photo from the window of a train as he pulled into Pyongyang from Dandong. It looked like something you would see in a theater, he says. It's a bit too perfect.\n\nStory highlights A North Korean senior intelligence officer has become the highest-ranking military official to defect to South Korea Terence Roehrig: North Korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEditor's note: Terence Roehrig is professor of national security affairs and director of the Asia-Pacific Studies Group at the U.S. Naval War College. These views expressed here are the author's alone and do not represent the official position of the Navy, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.\n\nA report Tuesday that North Korea could be preparing to launch a ballistic missile with the potential to hit parts of the United States is just the latest reminder of the continuing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The news comes amid a flurry of North Korean launches and threats in recent weeks, and amid rumors that Pyongyang might be preparing for another nuclear test.\n\nHow seriously should such threats be taken? In many respects, much of this is not a surprise; North Korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities. The difficulty, of course, has always been separating rhetoric and reality with a nation from which it is notoriously difficult to secure concrete information.\n\nTerence Roehrig\n\nBut a series of defections – including one by what is believed to be the highest ranking military officer so far – could offer some useful insights into what is going on there.\n\nOver the past few days, the South Korean government has taken the highly unusual action of announcing the arrival of a number of high-profile North Korean defectors to the South. The defectors include a group of 13 workers from a North Korea-owned restaurant in China.\n\nThe North Korean government operates more than 130 restaurants in a dozen countries to earn hard currency that is sent back to Pyongyang. In addition, government officials also confirmed the defections of two North Korea diplomats. One reportedly worked on economic matters in the embassy of an African country and defected in May 2015 with his family, while another diplomat was reported to have defected from an Asian nation in February.\n\nMost interesting, though, was the revelation on Monday that a high-level military officer who held the rank of colonel defected in 2015. The South Korea Defense Ministry offered few details, but confirmed that he was from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB, which was created in 2009 with the merger of several military and party organizations.\n\nThe organization reports directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and is responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage, along with the recent addition of cyberoperations under Bureau 121. Bureau 121 has itself been responsible for hack attacks on several South Korean media outlets, government institutions and banks, and is believed by U.S. officials to have been behind the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures.\n\nSecurity issues\n\nMedia reports indicate the officer may have been in charge of espionage operations in South Korea, and he is believed to be the highest-ranking military leader to have ever defected to the South. With all this in mind, it is clear why he could prove to be valuable.\n\nIt is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the North Korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. Access to a high-level military official familiar with the North Korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. In short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for Pyongyang.\n\nBut the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. The public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the North (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).\n\nThe South Korean government has made the case that these defections are a sign that the economic sanctions imposed in the wake of North Korean weapons testing are working, and that people are voting with their feet. Conservative media sources, meanwhile, are also making the argument these defections are a sign of serious elite discontent that may lead to instability in North Korea.\n\nMORE: North Korea sentences U.S. student to 15 years hard labor\n\nInstability on the horizon?\n\nCritics say the revelations are political and intended to influence the upcoming National Assembly elections by highlighting security issues. They argue that by highlighting the supposed success of recent sanctions, the government is hoping to energize conservative support for the ruling Saenuri Party.\n\nAdding an additional layer of intrigue is a report by the progressive Hankyoreh newspaper, which reported that the Unification Ministry did not want to release information on the defectors, but was forced to do so by the Park Geun-hye administration. The government has for its part denied there were political motives in announcing the defections, maintaining the high-level nature of these examples and their links to U.N. sanctions and elite discontent were important to reveal.\n\nStill, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. The colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of North Korea's leadership. Moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in North Korea. Could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?\n\nThe North Korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the U.S. and regional allies like South Korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully. But the type of information that could potentially be gleaned from the sources revealed this past week may be one of the few windows we have to improving our understanding of one of the most isolated nations in the world.\n\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.
(CNN) The US set a grim milestone Monday as the country recorded over 200,000 new Covid-19 cases for seven straight days, according to John Hopkins University.\n\nThe nation has never hit this milestone before, JHU data shows. Over the last week, the US has tallied over 1.7 million total Covid-19 cases and over 20,000 deaths.\n\nOn top of that, Covid-19 hospitalizations have surpassed 100,000 for the last 40 straight days and officials are trying to ramp up the pace of vaccinations across the country.\n\nWe really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\nExperts have long said the best combined defense against surging cases includes preventative measures such as masks and social distancing -- as well as widespread vaccination.\n\nNearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine against coronavirus in the US and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nWe don't have a public health infrastructure for mass vaccination, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n\nMany states are diverging from vaccine prioritization guidelines set by the CDC, according to a report issued Monday by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy.\n\nOn some level it's understandable and on some level, the more people that are getting vaccine, especially two doses of vaccine -- that's more people who then aren't going to transmit this virus, and we get a greater and greater level of herd immunity, Offit said.\n\nAs of Monday morning, 35.3% of doses distributed had been administered, compared with 30.2% on Friday.\n\nHealth officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.\n\nWe need to acknowledge that it's not working, Gottlieb said Sunday of the vaccination plan. We need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.\n\nMore people, sites and online resources for vaccines\n\nAs the surge ratchets up infection, hospitalization and fatality numbers across the country, officials are working to make it easier to access vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom promised Monday to have one million state health care workers, nursing home residents and staff vaccinated by week's end. This all hands on deck push to get the vaccine to more vulnerable residents comes as the state continues to see an unrelenting surge of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nAs of Monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.\n\nThe announcement came the same day California surpassed 30,000 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. California is one of only three states to reach the milestone.\n\nIn order to loosen the backlog, California plans to use Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Padres Stadium in San Diego and CalExpo in Sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and Newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.\n\nIn New York, more vaccination sites have opened, including more 24/7 sites in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that he's confident the city will reach its goal of administering 1 million doses by the end of January.\n\nOn Monday, New York state expanded the people eligible for the vaccine to include those 75 and older, first responders, teachers and school workers, public-facing grocery store workers, transit workers and people living and working in homeless shelters.\n\nNew Jersey will have a network of about 300 vaccination sites across the state to assist with its Covid-19 vaccination plan, state officials said at a news conference.\n\nOur objective and aspiration is 70% of the adult population in the state within six months, that's 4.7 million New Jerseyans, said Gov. Phil Murphy, speaking at Rowan College at Gloucester County, one of six mega-site vaccination locations.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health launched a Covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the CDC Covid Data Tracker.\n\nThe website will not allow for scheduling but will provide contact information for people to schedule vaccinations once available, according to a news release.\n\nThe CDC updated its guidance Monday, saying there's no maximum time between a first and second coronavirus shot.\n\nYou should get your second shot: for the Pfizer-BioNTech 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first shot; for the Moderna 1 month (or 28 days) after your first shot, the CDC said.\n\nYou should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. \n\nThe World Health Organization said last week that people can wait for as long as six weeks between doses. However, Pfizer and Moderna say they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.\n\nA deadlier pace than 2020\n\nMore than 28,400 new Covid-19 deaths have been reported in just the first 11 days of 2021, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nAt this rate, more people could die from Covid-19 in January than in any other month of this pandemic. December had a record high of 77,431 deaths due to Covid-19.\n\nIn hard-hit Arizona, the crisis will get worse, said Joe K. Gerald, associate professor at the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health.\n\nWe should expect to set new records for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the coming weeks. Policy action is urgently needed to mitigate the worst possible outcome, Gerald wrote.\n\nHe also expressed concern about the inevitable arrival of the more highly transmissible strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the United Kingdom and has spread to at least 10 US states\n\nAs of Monday, there have been 72 cases of the new variant, including at least 32 in California, 22 in Florida, five in Minnesota, four in New York, three in Colorado, two in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia.\n\nIf it gathers a foothold, it will accelerate, lengthen, and deepen Arizona's outbreak, Gerald said.\n\nOn Monday, Arizona set a record with 4,997 people hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons, according to the state's data dashboard. Before the winter, the state's record for hospitalizations was 3,517 on July 13, 2020. The state surpassed that record December 11 and the tally of patients has, with a few exceptions, risen every day since then.\n\nArizona recently opened a 24/7 site to administer vaccines. The operation at the home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team is being overseen by the National Guard. Adjutant Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire said at a news conference more resources are needed to implement the idea across the state.\n\nBiden gets second shot\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware.\n\nHe received the first dose last month live on national television as part of an effort by his incoming administration to reassure the country of the vaccine's safety.\n\nJUST WATCHED 100 million vaccine doses in Biden's first 100 days 'realistic' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 100 million vaccine doses in Biden's first 100 days 'realistic' 02:21\n\nThe President-elect expressed his confidence in the vaccine and encouraged Americans to receive one as soon as it becomes available to them.\n\nThe incoming administration is planning to carefully ensure people get their second Covid-19 vaccine doses, according to Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe incoming administration is planning very carefully to make sure that that second shot is delivered on time, Osterholm said in a Washington Post Live event.\n\nMeanwhile, a new analysis found that states are increasingly abandoning guidelines from the CDC and taking their own approaches to giving people coronavirus vaccine.\n\nOverall, we find states are increasingly diverging from CDC guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to COVID-19 vaccines in these first months of the U.S. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives, the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report.\n\nIn addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine roll-out labyrinth across the country.\n\nCongresswoman tests positive\n\nUS Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that she has tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nA statement from her office said Coleman believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the US Capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. As reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\n\nCNN has previously reported that six House Republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the US Capitol insurrection. It's unclear whether Watson Coleman was in the safe location with those members.
General Electric's 110-year run in the Dow could be nearing its end.\n\nThe company's unending list of problems led Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch to predict that GE is likely to be dropped from the Dow.\n\nInch, a frequent critic of GE, appears to be the first major analyst to make such a call. In his report on Wednesday, he cited GE's substantial challenges, including a serious cash crisis, badly slumping power division and efforts to dramatically shrink the sprawling conglomerate. There's also the SEC investigation that GE disclosed last week.\n\nGE's (GE) cratering stock price, which is hovering near six-year lows, is another issue. While the Dow has soared 32% over the past year, GE has lost nearly half its value.\n\nThe committee that runs the Dow prefers to have no more than a 10-to-1 ratio between the high and low stock on the index. But the ratio between GE and Boeing (BA) is more than twice that today.\n\nThat's important because the Dow is weighted by its stock price. Most other market indexes are weighted by market cap. So a 1% move in a $350 stock like Boeing would move the Dow significantly more than a 1% move in $16 stock like GE.\n\nNo decisions about booting GE have been announced. It's possible that the committee in charge of the Dow's membership may opt to stick with GE.\n\nA spokesman at S&P Global, which controls the Dow, declined to weigh in due to company policy. We do not provide comment on potential adds or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material, he said.\n\nRelated: GE is under SEC investigation\n\nGE is an original member of the Dow, the index born in 1896 that is perhaps the most recognizable market metric in the world. But the company was removed and invited back several times, before returning in 1907 where it has remained ever since.\n\nDespite GE's current crisis, there is a case to be made for keeping the stock in the Dow. While GE's stock price has cratered, it still boasts a very large market valuation of about $140 billion. That's bigger than seven Dow stocks, including McDonald's (MCD), Caterpillar (CAT), Nike (NKE) and American Express (AXP).\n\nGE is also still a massive company, with its fingers in everything from aviation and power plants to healthcare and railroads. Corporate filings indicate GE employed about 295,000 people as of the end of 2016, though recent layoffs have reduced its headcount.\n\nHowever, GE is in retreat mode. It long ago parted ways with NBC, Universal Studios and much of GE Capital. Now it's planning to jettison its light bulb and railroad divisions. GE is even considering an outright breakup of the company.\n\nIt's possible that GE may not be as representative of the broad American economy as it once was.\n\nConsider that GE's stock is plunging even as the U.S. economy gathers momentum and rival industrial companies like Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming.\n\nIt's a great time for industrials, said Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna. The divergent performance for GE is simply egregious.\n\nRelated: GE's $31 billion pension nightmare\n\nGE's downfall has been caused in large part by bad decisions under former CEO Jeff Immelt about where to deploy the company's cash. Some acquisitions, like the 2015 purchase of Alstom, have backfired badly. Instead of shoring up its underfunded pension, GE aggressively bought back stock and paid out a fat dividend that last year had to be halved.\n\nGetting kicked out of the prestigious 30-stock index would be the cherry atop an embarrassment sundae.\n\nIf GE were kicked out of the Dow, there's no guarantee it would be replaced by another industrial company.\n\nWhen AT&T (T) was removed from the Dow in 2015, it was substituted by Apple (AAPL). (AT&T has agreed to acquire CNN parent Time Warner). Honeywell (HON) and Altria (MO) were replaced in 2008 with Bank of America (BAC) and Chevron (CVX).\n\nThis time, a tech titan like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) could be swapped in. Then again, Amazon and Alphabet sport stock prices above $1,100, making their inclusion potentially problematic.\n\n--CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.
(CNN) House Democrats want you to believe these two things -- at the same time:\n\n1) The threat posed by Donald Trump is so dire that, if Vice President Mike Pence won't remove him from office this week, then they must immediately vote to impeach the President (again).\n\n2) In order to avoid cluttering Joe Biden's first days in office with an impeachment trial, they may wait for up to 100 days to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.\n\nIf those two ideas seem directly contradictory to you, well, good! It means you are paying attention. Because they are directly contradictory.\n\nIt can't be both incredibly urgent that the House impeach Trump with just more than a week left in his term AND totally cool for the House to sit on the articles of impeachment until the Biden administration gets off the ground.\n\nRead More
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations.\n\nThe presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks.\n\nThe candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York.\n\nA coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff.\n\nAsked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many Americans, McCain said:\n\nWe needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America.\n\nMcCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and go shopping.\n\nI would have called them to serve, said McCain.\n\n\n\nThe GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want change in federal government.\n\nThey understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. Watch McCain talk about service »\n\nMcCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said:\n\nI'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about.\n\nMcCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois.\n\nLook, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding.\n\nMcCain also said that politics is tough business, and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America.\n\nObama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service.\n\nHe said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well.\n\nPart of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\n\nObama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service.\n\nOne of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\n\nObama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers.\n\nThe fact is that we have to have government. When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. Watch Obama talk about service »\n\nNow, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play.\n\nThe forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' Web site.\n\nEach presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a cause greater than oneself.\n\nObama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. This will be the cause of my presidency, he said.\n\nToday's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns.\n\nMcCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday.\n\nJohn McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'  he said.\n\nThat's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing. Watch how tensions are rising on the trail »\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's.\n\nObama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.\n\nI don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in Norfolk, Virginia. Enough is enough. Watch Obama deliver his harsh words »\n\nThe phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false.\n\nBut the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001.\n\nThe two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials.\n\nEarlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, McCain said. They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.\n\nI've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake, he said.\n\nThe Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, We will never forget those who died.\n\nOn 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, Obama said. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting.\n\nNearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue.\n\nThe poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.\n\nOpinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll.\n\nTime's Michael Duffy contributed to this report.\n\nAll About Barack Obama • John McCain • Terrorism • September 11 Attacks
Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAmbassador Marie Yovanovitch has retired, according to a senior State Department official. It is unclear when she retired, but the official said it was sometime in the last two weeks.\n\nYovanovitch was a career foreign service officer for more than 30 years, who was pulled from her post as Ambassador to Ukraine at the order of President Donald Trump.\n\nYovanovitch is the fourth top State Department official who has departed in the wake of the Ukraine impeachment inquiry. The others are former US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, former Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, and Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nNPR was first to report her retirement, which comes about two months after she provided public testimony as part of the House impeachment inquiry. She said she was devastated to find out that Trump had discussed her in such a negative way during his call with President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. She said Trump's comments about her sounded like a threat.\n\nYovanovtich did meet with diplomatic security after the revelations earlier this month that Robert Hyde and Lev Parnas were discussing surveilling her while she was in Kyiv. That investigation has not yet concluded.\n\nPompeo has never defended Yovanovitch by name. During an interview in Ukraine today, when asked if he felt any moral tension about Yovanvotich, Pompeo said he did not.\n\nWe delivered for the President of the United States on a Ukraine policy that will benefit the American people I hope for years and years to come, Pompeo said in an ABC News interview.\n\nMore background on Yovanovitch: In May 2019, Yovanovitch was recalled to Washington, months earlier than expected. The State Department said at the time that Yovanovitch was concluding her 3-year diplomatic assignment as planned and that her departure aligned with the presidential transition in Ukraine.
French President Emmanuel Macron takes a selfie picture with students during a visit at the high school Therese Planiole, in Loches, central France, as part of a trip to Indre-et-Loire on the theme of Education and professional training, on March 15, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / POOL / GUILLAUME SOUVANT (Photo credit should read GUILLAUME SOUVANT/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSixth graders at a Utah school are being encouraged to say yes to all dance partners at a Valentine's Day dance.\n\nStory highlights School district is changing instructions for the dance after parent complaints Parent: Policy sends a bad message to boys that girls can't say 'no'\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSometimes the best of intentions have unintended consequences.\n\nKanesville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah, holds a sixth-grade dance on Valentine's Day each year. The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.\n\nBut times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance's protocol this year.\n\nNatalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn't refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.\n\nThe teacher said she can't. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, 'Excuse me?,' Richard told CNN affiliate KSTU.\n\nAt a time when parents are teaching kids they don't need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there's been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.\n\nTo many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.\n\nIt sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say 'yes' – sends a bad message to boys that girls can't say 'no,' Richard said.\n\nPsychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I can't say 'no' to a boy. That's the message kids are getting.\n\nThe Weber School District got the message, too. In a statement sent to CNN Monday night, community relations specialist Lane Findlay said the instructions for the dance have been changed.\n\nAccording to the statement, attendance at the dance has typically been voluntary but encouraged. Students are asked to fill out a dance card with names of classmates they'd like to dance with. Half the dancer selections are the girl's choice and the other half are the boy's choice, and students can't dance with the same person more than once.\n\nPHOTO: Weber School District Students are encouraged to write the names of classmates they'd like to dance with.\n\nBut now students will be free to say no.\n\nIn the best interest of our students, we are re-examining the procedures surrounding these dances and will make any necessary changes to promote a positive environment where all students feel included and empowered in their choices, the statement said.\n\nWe have advised our schools to eliminate any sort of language in the instructions surrounding these dances that would suggest a student must dance with another student.\n\nThe announcement will no doubt please some parents who had posted messages on Facebook criticizing the school's dance policy.\n\nRespectfully decline to dance… Children should learn to say no thanks in uncomfortable situations, wrote one.\n\nGirls should not have to feel obligated to say yes to anyone. Especially when it involves physical contact, wrote another. I would rather keep my daughter home instead of making that environment acceptable.
Washington (CNN) The Pentagon's top policy official who warned against withholding military aid to Ukraine last year resigned on Wednesday at the request of President Donald Trump, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by CNN.\n\nJohn Rood, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy at the Pentagon, is the latest senior national security official involved in the Ukraine controversy to be forced out following Trump's acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, but sources told CNN that he broke with the administration on several issues, in addition to the handling of aid to Ukraine, leading to a loss of support from leadership.\n\nIt is my understanding from Secretary Esper that you requested my resignation from serving as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.

Trump wrote, also sharing a story from Bloomberg News which indicated that Rood faced pressure to resign from some who lost confidence in his ability to carry out Trump agenda.\n\nRead More
Seoul blocks beheading video\n\n\n\n\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government is trying to block Internet access to graphic video footage of the beheading of Kim Sun-il as public anger grows over his brutal slaying.\n\nThe move comes as President Roh Moo-hyun on Thursday ordered a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding Kim's kidnapping and murder in Iraq by Islamic militants.\n\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Information and Communication has introduced a 24-hour monitoring system in a bid to close down any Web site that uploads video footage of Kim's execution.\n\nA tape of the beheading was first posted on an Islamic Web site and has subsequently made its way onto a number of other sites.\n\nThe tape shows the killing in graphic detail.\n\nThe Information Ministry has also asked local Internet service providers to block the spread of the footage where possible, for fears it could further inflame anti-government passions sparked by the killing.\n\nThe militants believed responsible for the grisly slaying had demanded the South Korean government drop plans to send 3,000 troops to Iraq in exchange for Kim's freedom.\n\nBut Seoul was adamant it would not be blackmailed by terrorists.\n\nWhen the nation is in mourning, the ministry felt it was necessary to take strong measures, a ministry official told Reuters news agency.\n\nWhen we think it's appropriate, we will take legal actions or request police investigation.\n\nThe ministry shut down a local Web site showing images of the killing late Wednesday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe government's policy on troops in Iraq is deeply unpopular with many in South Korea, a sentiment that has been exacerbated by the Kim murder.\n\nKim, a 33-year-old Arabic-speaking interpreter, was an evangelical Christian who had worked in Iraq for a year for a South Korean firm supplying the U.S. army.\n\nRoh has asked his top advisers for an extensive review into the circumstances surrounding Kim's death following media reports that South Korea's Foreign Ministry had been notified of his kidnapping in early June.\n\nThe news of Kim's slaying Wednesday was met with sorrow and outrage around the world, with South Koreans rallying close to the U.S. embassy in Seoul, late on Wednesday.\n\nKim's body was found by U.S. military police west of Baghdad and appeared to have been thrown from a vehicle.\n\nThe man had been beheaded, and the head was recovered with the body,a senior coalition official in Iraq said.\n\nPentagon sources said the body had been booby-trapped with explosives. (Full story)\n\nReacting to the killing Roh expressed his sorrow but said he would never bow to terrorism.

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\n\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\n\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\n\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\n\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\n\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\n\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\n\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\n\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries. It hasn't happened.\n\nIt is time to admit there is no sensible agenda, policy or plan for the working or middle class to thrive in Trump's America. Once we do, we'll be better able to focus our energy on identifying a leader who prioritizes all of us.
Trump has used past addresses to highlight his administration's victories, target his political enemies and push forward on efforts to fulfill his vision for the country.\n\nThe President is banking on the strong US economy and trade deal victories to carry his reelection campaign to a win in November, and he's sure to highlight his wins on Tuesday.\n\nHis approval rating among voters stands at 45% according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS -- no worse than his approval rating in December and the highest it's been since July. And in December, 76% of individuals polled said they rated the economy very or somewhat good, indicating a shifting tide in Americans' economic outlook, which had remained tepid in the wake of the recession.\n\nHere's what to watch for during Tuesday's State of the Union:\n\nImpeachment\n\nTrump aides had once hoped the address would be an opportunity for vindication following a Senate acquittal, but the Senate won't hold its final vote on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress until Wednesday -- the day after the President is scheduled to deliver his speech.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that the word impeachment is not in the President's State of the Union speech, but suggested that it could be added to a later draft.\n\nI've read through the speech, and I've not seen the word impeachment. As he likes to say, 'We'll see what happens,'  he told reporters.\n\nUnlike President Bill Clinton, who apologized to the country after he was acquitted, people close to Trump said they anticipated he will continue to proclaim his complete and total innocence\n\nI don't see the President making a big statement one way or another that would indicate anything different than what he's been saying for many months, one Republican close to Trump said.\n\nA senior administration official laying out plans for the speech wouldn't divulge whether the President would bring up impeachment during his remarks, but they did say the speech isn't being written in a vacuum and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it's delivered.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of Republican senators said they hope Trump steers clear of impeachment talk during his address to the bipartisan audience.\n\nStaunch ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it would be smart to focus on other issues, encouraged Trump to be positive and posited that most people are ready to move on from impeachment.\n\nI hope he is, too, because I am, said Graham.\n\nCampaign pitch\n\nThe overall theme of Trump's speech will be the Great American Comeback, the senior administration official said. The President is expected to focus on what he sees as victories for his administration through the lens of election issues, such as the economy, health care and national security.\n\nThe official said Trump is expected to focus on five areas: blue-collar workers, promoting and supporting families, lowering health care costs, immigration and protecting American families.\n\nThe President is also expected to draw contrast between his beliefs and the proposed policies of Democrats.\n\nSpecifically, the official said Trump is expected to contrast his health care policies with those on the socialist left, presenting a sharp difference with policies such as Medicare for All, which has been touted by some Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nA mixed crowd\n\nTrump's speech is, of course, expected to be delivered in the presence of several members of Congress who are often at odds with the administration's policies. However, this year's speech will be a markedly more contentious year between the President and Democrats.\n\nIt will likely mark the first time Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in the same room in months. Their relationship became more tense after Pelosi began the impeachment proceedings, and, according to a Pelosi spokesman, the two have not spoken since the October 16 meeting in which Trump insulted Pelosi, including calling her a third-grade politician, before she and other top Democrats walked out and later accused the President of having a meltdown.\n\nIt will also likely mark the first time Trump will be in the same room as some of his Democratic opponents running for president. He's used recent interviews and speeches to unleash a litany of insults and attacks on his potential opponents, but the official previewing Trump's address wouldn't say whether he would do the same while speaking in the Senate chamber.\n\nI won't preview if he's going to call anybody out but I think the President would be entirely comfortable with that, the official said.\n\nCoverage of the Democrats' Iowa caucuses dominated televisions Tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that Trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals.\n\nChecking in on past promises\n\nThe President has used past State of the Union addresses to push new policy proposals, such as tax cuts, an infrastructure plan and health care revisions. Some of these proposals have been successful, while others have not.\n\nDuring the 2019 State of the Union, Trump called for the great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. But he held off on moving ahead, saying he would move on it only after the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was passed by Congress. He signed the pact into law last week.\n\nIn 2018, Trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. However, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. More recently, the President has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction.

(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nThe old saying Cash is king might never have been as true as it is right now. While many people like to use their credit card to earn travel points or miles that they can redeem for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, those plans are on hold for many at the moment thanks to the pandemic.\n\nSo, instead of sticking with a credit card that earns rewards for a vacation that isn't happening in the near future, why not consider a credit card that earns you cash back almost instantly? Having money in your pocket today allows you to use that cash on anything you desire — or save it for the future.\n\nInterested? Then check out our list of the best cash back credit cards to decide which one will best fit your needs.\n\nThe best cash back credit cards of 2021\n\nCiti® Double Cash Card: Best overall card for cash back\n\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Best for US supermarkets\n\nChase Freedom Flex: Best for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi: Best for gas purchases\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited: Best for flexibility\n\nInk Business Unlimited Credit Card: Best for small businesses\n\nDiscover it® Cash Back: Best sign-up bonus\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature® Card: Best for streaming\n\nBank of America® Cash Rewards credit card: Best for travel\n\nThe information for the Discover it Cash Back, U.S. Bank Cash+ and Bank of America Cash Rewards cards has been collected independently by CNN Underscored. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\n\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\n\nCiti Double Cash\n\nBest overall card for cash back\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\n\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\n\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\n\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\n\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\n\nBest for US supermarkets\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\n\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\n\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nPurchase protection and return protection.\n\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\n\nTerms apply.\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\n\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\n\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\n\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\n\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\n\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\n\nChase Freedom Flex\n\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\n\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\n\nCell phone protection.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\n\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\n\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\n\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa\n\nBest for gas purchases\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\n\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\n\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\n\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\n\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\n\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\n\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\n\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\n\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\n\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nBest for flexibility\n\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\n\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\n\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\n\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\nBest for small businesses\n\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\n\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\n\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\n\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\n\nPrimary rental car insurance.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\n\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\n\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\n\nDiscover it Cash Back\n\nBest sign-up bonus\n\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\n\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\n\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\n\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\n\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\n\nBest for streaming\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\n\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\n\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\n\nCell Phone Providers\n\nDepartment Stores\n\nElectronics Stores\n\nHome Utilities\n\nFurniture Stores\n\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\n\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\n\nGrocery Stores\n\nGas Stations\n\nRestaurants\n\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nBank of America Cash Rewards\n\nBest for travel\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\n\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\n\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\n\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\n\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\n\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\n\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

We hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:\n\n$9,650 for in-state public colleges\n\n$24,930 for out-of-state public colleges\n\n$33,480 for private colleges\n\nOf course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. Room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones.\n\nWhen we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college.\n\nBut for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. According to research by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of U.S. colleges.\n\nNow IHEP defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college.\n\nGiven that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. It's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions.\n\nThat said, just because some folks might very well be saving 10% of their income for college doesn't mean that they're saving in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nAnd that could spell the difference between affording college or winding up with a ridiculous pile of debt for privilege of having a child attend the university of his or her choice.\n\nFind a smarter way to save\n\nWhile setting aside money for college is a smart move off the bat, where you put that cash could have a huge impact on your eventual ability, or lack thereof, to pay those bills.\n\nFidelity Investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. And while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nThough you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. As long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.\n\nTraditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.\n\nThen there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.\n\nRelated: How should I save for my kid's college education?\n\nImagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. With a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.\n\nOn the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.\n\nHere's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.\n\nNow one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. It's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a Roth IRA, if you're eligible to open one. (Even if you can't fund one directly, you can always convert a traditional IRA to a Roth.)\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nNo matter how you decide to save for college, you should do so in a manner that lets you maximize your gains and minimize your taxes. Even if you're a relatively high earner, covering the cost of college is likely to be a challenge, so the smarter you are about how you save, the better your chances of meeting your ultimate goals.

(CNN) —\n\nA national fraternity and four men are expected to be sentenced Monday for charges related to the 2013 hazing death of Baruch College student and fraternity pledge Chun Michael Deng. Experts say the punishment could influence other cases that involve hazing deaths.\n\nPi Delta Psi Inc. was found guilty in November on a felony count of involuntary manslaughter, among other charges, though it was acquitted of the more serious charges of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nPHOTO: WNEP Chun Michael Deng\n\nIn May, four Pi Delta Psi members – Kenny Kwan, Raymond Lam, Charles Lai and Sheldon Wong – pleaded guilty to felony charges of voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension in Deng's death, which was the result of a hazing ritual.\n\nThe case bears numerous similarities to the February death of Timothy Piazza, a fraternity pledge at Penn State University who died after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol then engaging in a hazing ritual similar to the one that killed Deng. Legal experts wonder if the Pi Delta Psi case could have an impact on the Piazza case.\n\nAt the time of Deng's death, Baruch College said that Deng died participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the school had no knowledge of, adding it had a zero tolerance policy regarding hazing.\n\nPi Delta Psi ended its affiliation with its Baruch College colony, saying it had violated the values and rules of our organization. Individual members involved also had their fraternity memberships revoked.\n\nAccording to its website, the Asian-American fraternity has a presence on at least 25 college campuses across the country, most of which are based in the Northeast.\n\nPi Delta Psi Inc. and its lawyer did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nThere can be no question that the death of Michael Deng was tragic, said Todd Greenberg, an attorney for Lam.\n\nTo a lesser extent it's also a tragedy for Mr. Lam and the other young men. They never intended for this to happen, he said, adding Lam had been guilt ridden for his conduct since the day it happened.\n\nAn attorney for Wong told CNN, Sheldon remains, and will always be, deeply saddened and devastated by Michael Deng's death.\n\nLawyers for the two other individuals could not be reached for comment Sunday.\n\nPHOTO: Monroe County DA/Monroe County DA's office Four men pleaded guilty in May in connection to the death of Michael Deng in 2013.\n\nDeadly ritual and coverup\n\nDeng, an 18-year-old freshman at the New York City college, died in December 2013 during Pi Delta Psi's crossing over weekend for pledges, according to a criminal complaint. The fraternity chapter held the event at a rented house in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.\n\nIt was there Deng ultimately suffered and died from a traumatic brain injury while participating in the glass ceiling, a ritual that required pledges to run through a line of fraternity brothers who shoved, pushed and tackled the aspiring members to the ground.\n\nPHOTO: WNEP The house rented by the Baruch College colony of Pi Delta Psi in December 2013.\n\nAt some point, Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a weighted backpack, fell, struck his head and was immediately unconscious, according to police. Some fraternity members placed Deng by a fire while others searched the internet for his symptoms and tried to wake the pledge.\n\nMeanwhile, the criminal complaint said, other fraternity members were told by a member and the national fraternity president to protect the fraternity and hide all the memorabilia from police – including clothes, fraternity paddles, banners and signs. They were also instructed to conceal cellphones, marijuana and mushrooms, the complaint said.\n\nDeng arrived at a nearby hospital for treatment 2 hours after he was injured – a delay that a forensic pathologist concluded significantly contributed to the death of Mr. Deng, the complaint said.\n\nDeng's death was ruled a homicide, with forensic analysis revealing at least three clear impacts to the head, rendered by forces considered significant and severe.\n\nIt would take hundreds of pounds of impulsive loads and/or hundreds of G forces in order to cause the damage to the interior of the brain, the criminal complaint said.\n\nSetting precedent\n\nFour fraternity pledge deaths in 2017 overshadowed the case against Pi Delta Psi and its members. However, experts say university communities across the United States will be paying close attention to Monday's sentencing for indications of how other cases may be handled.\n\nPledge deaths are being investigated on the campuses of Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Texas State University.\n\nProsecutors in the February death of Penn State Beta Theta Pi pledge Timothy Piazza, in particular, will be watching the Deng case closely. The similarities in the two cases could mean that the Deng outcome effects the course of the Piazza prosecution.\n\nPiazza died as the result of a hazing ritual called the gauntlet, which involved pledges drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Afterward, Piazza fell several times, resulting in a traumatic brain injury and a laceration in his spleen that ultimately proved fatal.\n\nEven after it was clear he needed medical attention, fraternity members didn't call for help for at least 12 hours. A criminal presentment in the case detailed an alleged coverup, in which pledges were told to clean up evidence of alcohol and keep quiet about what happened. One member allegedly deleted video evidence from inside the house as police came to collect it.\n\nStill, there are crucial differences – particularly the role of alcohol. Whereas Piazza consumed at least 18 drinks in 82 minutes, according to video surveillance, Deng's toxicology report revealed no alcohol or other substances of abuse.\n\nPHOTO: Patrick Carns Photography Timothy Piazza, center, and his parents\n\nDoug Fierberg, an attorney for Deng's family, said prosecutors in the Piazza case could learn from the outcome of the Deng case and Pi Delta Psi case sentencing.\n\nThese are two of the higher-profile circumstances involving the prosecution of hazing, said Fierberg. Prosecutors in the Piazza case, he said, might as well learn from the outcome of the Deng case.\n\nFierberg said he expects the Deng case will help clarify some things ahead of the Piazza case and could set a number of precedents.\n\nNumber one, Fierberg said, national fraternities can and should be held criminal and civilly responsible for the injury and death caused by their members. The criminal prosecutions shows that can happen and should proceed that way and they can be convicted.\n\nIn regard to civil responsibility, Fierberg said the Deng case will show fraternities can carry the blame, and not just individual students who were involved.\n\nThere are reasons why young men die year in and year out at fraternities, Fierberg said. And the ability to reduce those incidents rests within the control of the national fraternities and universities, not solely in the lap of the men who are on the ground.\n\nNot all legal experts believe the Pi Delta Psi case will impact the Piazza case.\n\nMonroe County Assistant District Attorney Kimberly Metzger, the prosecutor in the Deng case, said on Friday the two cases are very different and that it would be inappropriate to comment on what (prosecutors in the Piazza case) might learn from our case.\n\nA 'chilling effect'\n\nThe outcome of the Pi Delta Psi case could also have an impact beyond Pennsylvania, said CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson, who predicted a chilling effect on universities and fraternities nationwide.\n\nI think there's a reckoning here, Jackson said, comparing the attention placed on recent hazing deaths to last year's #MeToo movement, which became a tipping point in how the public addresses sexual misconduct.\n\nFor whatever reason, this has reached a crescendo, and we're focused on it now, Jackson said. I think you will see forceful prosecutions in other jurisdictions and I think they can learn a lot from prosecutions in Pennsylvania. Universities, he said, will pay attention.\n\nHank Nuwer, a journalist and professor at Franklin College in Indiana who has been tracking and writing about hazing deaths since the 1970s, agreed with Jackson's assessment.\n\nNuwer said the verdict against Pi Delta Psi and looming sentence strengthens the arsenal for cases like Piazza's and others involving hazing.\n\nParents of victims and activists don't think there's enough being done in these cases, Nuwer said, and are pressuring courts to take a harder look at hazing deaths than they have in the past.\n\n03:40 - Source: CNN Parents open up on son's hazing death\n\nJudges are taking it more seriously, said Nuwer, adding that lawyers who didn't know how to bring a case against fraternities in the past now have greater understanding of how to handle such cases.\n\nI'm seeing huge changes from 1978 when my first article appeared, he said. These are important cases right now. That's going to be interesting to see how magistrates and juries look at fraternities now.\n\nHopefully, Jackson said, whatever sentence Pi Delta Psi receives, it deters other fraternities and ensures they enact policies to protect members and pledges.\n\nThey'll learn from the lessons of Pennsylvania, Jackson said. You're going to see aggressive prosecutions until this stops and that's the way it is.\n\nCNN's Sara Ganim contributed to this report.
This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\n\n(CNN) Flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday's riot at the US Capitol.\n\nThe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\n\nThe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\n\nThe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n\nThis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow, Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\nCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.\n\nNoose and gallows\n\nWhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. It is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged, he explains.\n\nThat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\n\nThree Percenters flag\n\nThe Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.\n\nLike others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.\n\nBecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants, according to the ADL.\n\nThe group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America's first flag.\n\nRelease the Kraken flag\n\nThe flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell's comments that she was going to release the Kraken. Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.\n\nThe Kraken, a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\n\nThe Proud Boys and the OK sign\n\nThe far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\n\nA photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture.\n\nSome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter.\n\nThe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying support your local Proud Boys.\n\nIn the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, They wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\n\nOne man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: It stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\n\nAsked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: The Proud Boys.\n\nThe Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at Stop The Steal rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys' leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a Stop the Steal event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner. He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\n\nKekistan flags\n\nThe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for Kek, a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\n\nThe Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke, Pitcavage explained. Younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.\n\nAltered historic flags\n\nAltered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol. One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan Come and take it to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase come and take it paraphrases the come and take them retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said.\n\nThe Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the Don't Tread on Me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians. But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\n\nOath Keepers\n\nA man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\n\nTheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL.\n\nThe Confederate flag\n\nDuring the United States' long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\n\nPhotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun.\n\nThe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the United States.\n\nAmerica First flag\n\nA rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building.\n\nAmerica First was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy . Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II.\n\nThe ADL says Fuentes is part of the groyper army, which the ADL calls a white supremacist group.\n\nWhile the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'Christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family, the ADL explains. Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true America' -- a white, Christian nation.\n\nCamp Auschwitz\n\nA rioter inside the Capitol wore a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads Work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words Arbeit macht frei on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II.\n\nPitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\n\nNationalist Social Club stickers\n\nA social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment It's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name.\n\nNSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL . It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club.\n\nNSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race, according to the ADL. Their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\n\nMAGA Civil War January 6, 2021 shirts\n\nThere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\n\nThe shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump's signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\n\nMany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\n\nUpdate note: This story has been updated with new CNN reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the Proud boys.
ExxonMobil XOM\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday dismissed Exxon's lawsuit claiming officials in New York and Massachusetts were pursuing bad faith investigations in violation of the oil giant's constitutional rights.\n\nUS District Judge Valerie Caproni called Exxon's position implausible.\n\nExxon has asked two federal courts—first in Texas, now in New York—to stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud, she wrote. It has done so on the basis of extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences.\n\nExxon maintained in the lawsuit that the attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts worked behind the scenes with environmental groups, who were attempting to promote litigation against fossil fuel companies. It also said the state officials tried to squash Exxon's right to free speech and dissenting opinions on climate change.\n\nExxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ruling.\n\nIn a statement, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who opened an investigation into Exxon's historical knowledge of climate change in 2015, praised the decision.\n\nHe said the lawsuit wrongfully attempted to thwart a serious state law enforcement investigation into the company.\n\nSchneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey are investigating whether Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, misled investors and the public about its knowledge of climate change and the potential effects that climate change may have on its business.\n\nHarvard study: Exxon 'misled the public' on climate change for nearly 40 years\n\nThe attorneys general are looking into whether Exxon's past securities filings were misleading because they failed to disclose the company's internal projections regarding the potential costs of climate change and expected environmental regulations.\n\nExxon filed a lawsuit against the New York and Massachusetts officials in 2016, claiming the probes were part of a conspiracy to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.\n\nExxon is also facing lawsuits from San Francisco, Oakland and other municipalities in California, which have demanded the company and its rivals pay billions of dollars to cover damage from looming sea level rise due to climate change.\n\nExxon gives up major climate change fight\n\nExxon argues that the California cities and counties have contradicted themselves by admitting in bond sales that climate change risks are unpredictable.\n\nFederal law requires companies and governments to reveal risks to investors before selling securities like stock or muni bonds.\n\nAnd in late 2017, after years of resisting, ExxonMobil agreed to reveal the risks it faces from climate change and the global crackdown on carbon emissions.\n\nExxon said the disclosures will include how the company is positioning for a lower-carbon future and how its business could be hurt by shifting energy demands.\n\n--CNN's Jackie Wattles and Matt Egan contributed to this report

Trump is returning to Washington, DC after attending fundraisers in New York, New York.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was caught by surprise by President Donald Trump's first travel ban executive order, issued a week after he took office, and violated two court orders in preventing some travelers from boarding US-bound flights, the department's inspector general said in a report Friday.\n\nThe long-awaited report found that US Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security Department agency responsible for securing US borders, was aggressive in preventing affected travelers from getting on flights, despite court orders that blocked the travel ban.\n\nThe department disputes the inspector general's finding, saying in a response to the report that the department did not countenance any violation of a court order and that [a]ny implication or statement to the contrary is unfortunate and misleading.\n\nAccording to the report, the department was largely caught by surprise when the travel ban was signed, with then Secretary John Kelly – now the White House chief of staff – having seen only two drafts in the days before the release.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection had practically no advance notice of the executive order, when it would become effective, and what it would contain, the inspector general said. The department also had no opportunity to provide expert input in the drafting of the ban, and [n]o policies, procedures, and guidance to the field were developed.\n\nThe ban went into effect while travelers were in the air bound for the US, requiring real-time policy improvising by Homeland Security, Justice and State departments.\n\nThe report cites the border agency's failures to comply with specific orders by continuing to put affected travelers through secondary inspection.\n\nThat policy led to a large number of travelers being processed and detained for additional, and specific periods of time, according to the report, which found that Customs and Border Protection generally complied with court directives, albeit with some delay and confusion.\n\nThe inspector general was also unable to substantiate allegations of unprofessional conduct on the part of Customs and Border Protection officers, although the report says one reported incident remains under investigation.
(CNN) — It's been a two-horse race this year to be named the world's most powerful passport, with both top contenders in Asia.\n\nGoing into the final quarter of 2019, Japan and Singapore held onto their position as the world's most travel-friendly passports.\n\nThat's the view of the Henley Passport Index , which periodically measures the access each country's travel document affords.\n\nSingapore and Japan's passports have topped the rankings thanks to both documents offering access to 190 countries each.\n\nSouth Korea rubs shoulders with Finland and Germany in second place, with citizens of all three countries able to access 188 jurisdictions around the world without a prior visa.\n\nFinland has benefited from recent changes to Pakistan's formerly highly restrictive visa policy. Pakistan now offers an ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) to citizens of 50 countries, including Finland, Japan, Spain, Malta, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates -- but not, notably, the United States or the UK.\n\nRelated content Passports for purchase: Open citizenship doors around the world\n\nThe European countries of Denmark, Italy and Luxembourg hold third place in the index, with visa-free/visa-on-arrival access to 187 countries, while France, Spain and Sweden are in the fourth slot, with a score of 186.\n\nFive years ago, the United States and the UK topped the rankings in 2014 -- but both countries have now slipped down to sixth place, the lowest position either has held since 2010.\n\nWhile the Brexit process has yet to directly impact on the UK's ranking, the Henley Passport Index press release observed in July, with its exit from the EU now imminent, and coupled with ongoing confusion about the terms of its departure, the UK's once-strong position looks increasingly uncertain.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates continues its ascent up the rankings, up five places to rank 15th.\n\nIt's the strongest climber this quarter, Lorraine Charles at Cambridge University's Centre for Business Research says in the October release.\n\nWhile the UAE may not be able to compete with Saudi Arabia -- the regional hegemon -- in terms of military strength and economic power, the projection of its soft power is uncontested in the GCC.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Afghanistan is once again at the bottom of the rankings, with its citizens needing a prior visa for all but 25 destinations worldwide.\n\nDr. Christian H.

There were just two words I uttered after job offers early in my career: Thank you.\n\nI never negotiated for more money. If I did think about it, I quickly worried that I would anger my future employer if I even asked.\n\nTo prevent women from making that mistake and to help narrow the gender pay gap (women still make around 80 cents for every dollar a man makes), the American Association of University Women (AAUW) is providing free salary negotiation workshops. Over 30,000 women have completed them since 2015, according to the AAUW.\n\nNow the goal is to train as many as 10 million women by 2022, by bringing workshops to more cities and states, and releasing a free online training tool, which will be available this summer. Currently, workshops are available in Boston, Washington, DC; Tempe, Arizona; Long Beach, California; San Francisco and various cities in Massachusetts.\n\nI think too many women unfortunately just don't talk about this enough, said Kimberly Churches, chief executive officer of AAUW. It's a muscle and it takes practice to learn negotiation skills and if you're not already in a sales job, that becomes even more trying.\n\nBased on a study conducted in Boston, where AAUW first started doing the workshops in collaboration with the Boston mayor's office, the extra training helps. Nearly half of the women who completed workshops in the first year either negotiated a pay raise at their existing job or a competitive starting salary at a new position, according to the report by the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy.\n\nRelated: #MeToo and #TimesUp have pushed 48% of companies to review pay policies\n\nHourly workers are negotiating and receiving $2 to $3 more per hour and salaried workers are getting 20% to 30% higher salaries after the workshops, said Churches.\n\nSabrina Antoine, 29, attended a free workshop in her Boston neighborhood. During the two hours, she learned how to define the values she brings to a company, conduct research to understand her value in the marketplace and practice asking for more in role play sessions.\n\nThe biggest piece about negotiating your salary for women particularly is that there is a sense of 'I am not enough' and so ... a lot of the training was around feeling comfortable taking the extra mile, said Antoine, who is an account manager in a nonprofit working with banks.\n\nShortly after the training, Antoine entered into negotiations for a new position in her organization. But first, she practiced by looking in the mirror, and doing a role play with a trusted colleague. She pushed for 40% more than she was currently making and then ended her pitch.\n\nThat's what they teach you in the training is 'say your piece and stop talking.' You don't have to fill the silence, said Antoine, who ended up getting the 40% increase she asked for.\n\nRelated: Equality at work sounds great but how do we get there?\n\nA new survey shows how critical this training can be. Forty percent of women have received salary increases of 5% or less in the past five years, which is below the cost of living increases during the same time frame, according to the SheKnows Media survey of nearly 1,500 working women in the US. Nearly half of the women surveyed said women are less likely to ask for raises and promotions than men.\n\nTo help women overcome their fears about negotiating, Ashley Pare, founder and chief executive officer of Own Your Worth, which helps women grow and manage their careers, turns the tables and has them focus on what they are giving up.\n\nI flip it and I ask 'well what are the consequences if you don't ask? How much money are you leaving on the table? Will you be able to pay your bills? Will you have the life that you desire?'  said Pare, who attended one of the workshops in 2015.\n\nPare said she sometimes asked for more during her career in corporate human resources but that the workshop convinced her to stay in the game longer as she negotiated a new position.\n\nIn the past, I would ask but I didn't persist, so after that first workshop I went to, it definitely gave me the confidence to ask for everything that I wanted and go back and forth a couple of times to land at a happy medium.\n\nShe now volunteers as a facilitator at AAUW workshops in Boston.\n\nEmployers expect you to negotiate so it's ... knowing that you can and it's OK and you should because it's one way that we can help make a difference, said Pare.

The Mexican government reaffirmed on January 18, 2018 that they will not pay for US President Donald Trump's controversial border wall and warned that the violence in Mexico is also the result of the heavy drug consumption in the United States. / AFP PHOTO / Herika MARTINEZ (Photo credit should read HERIKA MARTINEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a televised appeal to Americans on Tuesday for his long-promised border wall, offering familiar warnings but scant detail on how he will negotiate an end to a partial government shutdown that will cost some federal workers their paychecks this week.\n\nIn an address to the nation meant to convince Americans of a swelling border crisis that was at times belied by facts, the President gave little indication he is nearing a compromise that might reopen the federal government.\n\nIn their response minutes after Trump concluded on Tuesday, the top Democrats in Congress demonstrated an equally entrenched stance.\n\nWith neither side appearing to budge after a high-stakes battle of messaging, the situation appeared unchanged as some federal workers prepare for their first missed paycheck and many agencies remain dark.\n\nAs expected, the President used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to warn of a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\n\nBut he did not declare the situation a national emergency, stopping short of a move he's openly weighed in the past days that could secure funding but would likely face a legal challenge.\n\nThe immigration matter, Trump intoned, is a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.\n\nAltogether, the President used the word crisis six times in his remarks, seeking to imbue a deadlocked debate over funding with a new sense of urgency.\n\nSpeaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Trump said the US could no longer accommodate immigrants who enter the country illegally and implored those who support him to contact their elected representatives.\n\nHow much American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? he asked. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\n\nHe castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.\n\nThe only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\n\nAfter weeks of a partial government shutdown, Trump and his negotiators have made little headway in convincing Democrats a barrier is needed before agencies can reopen and federal workers can begin receiving paychecks again.\n\nThe administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. Fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more Americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, Trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.\n\nIn making his case, Trump turned for the first time to one of the most recognizable symbols of the American presidency – an eight-minute direct-to-camera evening address from the Oval Office.\n\nThe idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with Americans. The idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at Camp David.\n\n04:48 - Source: CNN Democratic leaders respond to Trump's address\n\nInside the White House, some viewed the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day as a lost opportunity that could have been used to drive home an urgent message about the necessity of a border wall while Congress was out of town.\n\nTrump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.\n\nTrump will continue the push in the following days, paying a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen on Thursday to highlight the situation.\n\nOn Wednesday, he'll join Republican senators during their weekly lunch. Later he'll return to the White House to resume talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, though it wasn't yet clear whether either side would come offering new elements of a compromise.\n\nThis situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, Trump said in his remarks.\n\nWhether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.\n\nFacts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\n\nThe administration's own figures show vastly more known or suspected terrorists were apprehended at airports.\n\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\n\nNational emergency?\n\n02:42 - Source: CNN Avlon lays out the facts on border security\n\nIn the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.\n\nThe White House counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. Trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.\n\nA source close to Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday that the President has been working the phones seeking advice from friends and aides in recent days about whether he should declare an emergency at the border in order to secure funding for the wall. The source said Trump has been told by several of his allies and advisers that a declaration probably won't work from a legal standpoint, though hasn't ruled one out entirely.\n\nAnother adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.\n\nWork in progress\n\n02:53 - Source: CNN Brianna Keilar: Trump is pushing lies\n\nMidday on Tuesday, Trump was working closely with top aides, including policy adviser Stephen Miller, on drafts of the speech.\n\nDemocrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.\n\nPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government, Pelosi said.\n\nTrump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and Democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.\n\nThe closures have become more apparent this week, as more Americans return from holiday vacations to find some federal services unavailable. Most federal workers affected by the shutdown were due to receive paychecks on Friday; without an agreement, they won't be paid.\n\nTrump has insisted in public that unpaid workers are understanding in their plight, and that he feels their pain.\n\nBut in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects. Yet he's also fretted that failing to deliver on the border wall – his chief campaign vow – would hurt him with his conservative base.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated.

Konwiserís husband Jeremy (right) is also a trainer at the zoo and her family has been notified. Stacey graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a Bachelor's degree in Biology and received her Masters degree in Conservation Biology from the University of Queensland in Australia, according to the Palm Beach Zoo's official Facebook page.\n\nStory highlights Zoo official: Keeper broke protocol by entering area occupied by tiger Stacey Konwiser was killed in a secure tiger enclosure Expert: Tiger would have looked at her like a ball of yarn to play with\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPalm Beach zookeeper Stacey Konwiser dedicated her life to protecting an endangered subspecies. Colleagues describe the 38-year-old as a wife, a daughter and a sister to those with whom she worked.\n\nStacey Konwiser, 38, died April 15 after a 13-year-old male Malayan tiger delivered a fatal neck injury inside a secured portion of the tiger area.\n\nBut questions still remain about the circumstances surrounding the death of the lead tiger keeper at the Palm Beach Zoo.\n\nThe day of the attack, the zoo's spokeswoman said Konwiser had absolutely not done anything out of the ordinary when she entered the area where tigers eat and sleep.\n\nThis was part of a daily procedure that takes place, this was something that was done every single day. She was efficient and proficient in doing this task and an unfortunate situation occurred, Naki Carter said.\n\nBut in a statement released Friday, a week after her death, Andrew Aiken, the zoo's president, said Konwiser had violated zoo policy.\n\nShe entered that same portion of the night house after it was clearly designated as accessible by a tiger, Aiken said.\n\nUnder Palm Beach Zoo policy, zoo employees are never allowed to enter a tiger enclosure to which the animal has access.\n\nDeath 'no mystery'\n\nThere is absolutely no mystery as to how Stacey Konwiser died, according to a statement posted in a new FAQ section on the Palm Beach Zoo's website.\n\nThe question is: why did a deeply talented and experienced zookeeper, fully aware of the presence of a tiger and knowledgeable of our safety protocols, enter a tiger enclosure into which a tiger had access? it said.\n\nThe statement also clarified that although the night house has video surveillance cameras, they were not recording at the time, and are only activated when the zoo has newborn tiger cubs.\n\nWhy or how this could possibly occur is the subject of five ongoing investigations, including our own, Aiken said in his statement.\n\nThe zoo said the afternoon that Konwiser entered the enclosure, she was alone, which is in compliance with the nationalized standards from the Association of Zoos & Aquariums.\n\nCNN's attempts to reach the zoo for further comments were not immediately successful.\n\nNo guarantee 'cat won't kill you'\n\nDave Salmoni, a large predator expert and TV host for Animal Planet, said there is no way to ever guarantee that a cat won't kill you.\n\nAlmost never would you allow a keeper to have access to a dangerous predator … If she's given these keys then she has a history of perfect gate-locking procedure, he added.\n\nKonwiser had worked at the zoo for three years and was very experienced with tigers, zoo officials said.\n\nPHOTO: Palm Beach Zoo Stacey Konwiser with her husband, Jeremy Konwiser.\n\nSalmoni said no matter the relationship between Konwiser and the tiger, once she entered that enclosure, if this was something unusual, the tiger would have looked at her like a ball of yarn to play with.\n\nOnce she started to struggle or moved quickly, that tiger's primal hunter instinct would have then come into play, he said.\n\nThreats against tiger\n\nThe rare tiger was one of four at the facility, held in a contained area where the animals are fed and sleep, Carter said. The exhibit has surveillance cameras but is closed to the public, Carter said. It is not known at this time whether there is surveillance footage of the incident.\n\nThe male tiger was tranquilized after the attack and remains at the facility. Zoo officials have declined to provide information on the tiger, including its name.\n\nIdentifying the animal only serves to stigmatize and potentially places the tiger in harm's way, the zoo said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. It said it has received threats against the animal.\n\nThe tiger was off-exhibit at the time and no guests could see what happened, Carter said. The tiger was never on the loose, contrary to early reports on social media, she said.\n\nOther recent attacks by big cats\n\n• In January, a keeper was severely injured at an Australian zoo founded by the late wildlife conservationist Steve Irwin.\n\n• Last September, a keeper was attacked and killed by a a Sumatran tiger at a zoo in Hamilton, New Zealand.\n\n• In June 2015, police shot and killed a white tiger that killed a man in Tbilisi, Georgia, after severe flooding allowed hundreds of wild animals to escape the city zoo.\n\n• In 2013, a 24-year-old woman working at a Northern California animal sanctuary was mauled and killed by a lion.\n\n• In 2007, an escaped Siberian tiger attacked and killed one zoo patron and injured two others in a cafe at the San Francisco Zoo.\n\n• In 2003, a white tiger attacked Roy Horn of Siegfried and Roy during a performance in Las Vegas. The tiger lunged at Horn's neck about halfway through the show and dragged him off stage as audience members watched.\n\nCNN's Keith Allen and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report
(CNN) — There's hope: Summer vacations abroad may happen in a big way this year.\n\nThe number of people busting out of their countries will start creeping up this spring and rise higher by mid-year, travel industry experts predict, as vaccines and risk-based safety measures are rolled out more widely and spiking coronavirus cases around the world begin to fall once again.\n\nI'm actually quite confident that first of May onwards ... we'll all be in a much better world, said Paul Charles, founder and CEO of London-based travel consultancy The PC Agency\n\nVaccines and testing are the way forward, Charles and other industry experts say, but what's needed perhaps as desperately is greater consistency and coordination across borders.\n\nWhen you don't have a coordinated global approach, it's very difficult for the industry to go forward, especially when you have the rules of the game changing basically every single day, said Luis Felipe de Oliveira, director general of Airports Council International (ACI), a global trade organization representing the world's airports.\n\nDeparture testing is one component of making travel safer during the pandemic. Joseph Okpako/Getty Images\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done in ironing out testing protocols that would allow globetrotters to opt out of quarantines and finding ways to smoothly and securely share vaccination and testing information across borders.\n\nSovereign nations still decide what's best for them individually, looking at their own health situations and economies, but progress has been made in getting countries to look more globally at the huge economic force that is travel.\n\nICAO, ACI, An alphabet soup of agencies, organizations and companies ( UNWTO WTTC , the airlines and so on) have collaborated on numerous sets of guidelines and global recommendations aimed at making travel safer, easier and less confusing for a world of consumers starving for a change of scene.\n\nACI's de Oliveira says that the summer rebound could mean international air traffic reaching 50% to 60% of previous levels in most countries.\n\nHere are some of the hurdles travelers and the industry will need to get over as travel picks up:\n\nRelated content 21 places to go in 2021\n\nEliminating quarantines\n\nMandatory -- and shifting -- quarantine requirements basically are killing the process to restart the industry, de Oliveira said.\n\nWhen he spoke to CNN Travel, de Oliveira was on day 12 of a 14-day quarantine in Montreal after returning home from a business trip to the Dominican Republic followed by a personal trip to Mexico. He has quarantined four times in the past seven months, spending 56 days at home without the possibility of going out.\n\nThat kind of time investment, along with the confusion around requirements -- both going and coming home -- are big deterrents for people who might otherwise be willing to travel. Safety is essential, but those in the industry are advocating for a more nuanced, layered approach.\n\nTravelers at a hotel in Melbourne, Australia in December had to quarantine after returning from overseas. WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA test-out mechanism is needed to avoid quarantines, says Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy at the national nonprofit U.S. Travel Association, which has been advocating for a science-driven, risk-based approach to reopening international travel in particular looking at the elimination of quarantines if you have the right testing protocol in place.\n\nWhile vaccines will be critical, de Oliveira and others say the travel industry absolutely cannot afford to wait to ramp up until vaccinations are fully administered globally, making testing an essential part of the equation for safer travel in the near-term.\n\nRelated content How risky is flying during a pandemic? What we know and how to make it safer\n\nBarnes mentioned a two-tiered regimen of testing 72 hours before departure and again upon arrival as one possible standard, and she cited a testing pilot program in Hawaii -- where a 10-day quarantine can be bypassed on most islands with negative test results -- as an example of where testing out of quarantine has generated demand.\n\nWhile U.S. Travel would encourage people to get vaccinated and to test out in places that require quarantines, the association isn't looking for blanket requirements for access, Barnes said. We wouldn't say that you have to have a vaccine to travel.\n\nShe acknowledges that determining who is responsible for creating and implementing consistent protocols is a challenge. The government doesn't necessarily want to, she said, and I don't know that the private sector should have that responsibility.\n\nYet countries and organizations around the world are making progress in coordinating common approaches, says Alessandra Priante, regional director for Europe at the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), a specialized agency of the United Nations.\n\nA coordinated way of testing is already being implemented in numerous cases, and the next step at a global level is tracing, Priante says, to make sure that we're able to share a certain amount of data, because if we don't share the data, then we are not really able to have all the information that we should have.\n\nThe travel industry can't afford to wait until vaccines have been distributed globally to ramp up. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGetting vaccinated ... and proving it\n\nSome of that information likely would pertain to vaccinations. The United Kingdom's vaccination program is well under way. Other countries have also made significant progress, and the United States' program is slowly ramping up.\n\nTraveler confusion may well ramp up, too, as more people start moving around in the spring and additional requirements come into play for negative tests and proof of vaccination.\n\nAustralia, for example, just announced that it will require negative PCR Covid tests for all travelers, and airline Qantas has suggested that all international passengers may soon be required to have a vaccination certificate.\n\nWe'll need a harmonized global approach to recognizing and accurately and safely sharing vaccination and testing information, de Oliveira said.\n\nCurrent practices -- involving printed paper documents from unknown labs in languages that may be unfamiliar to those inspecting them or a tangle of unconnected databases across the world -- are less than ideal.\n\nThat's why ACI supports the use of health apps such as CommonPass , a tool that would allow travelers to share lab results and vaccination records without revealing other personal health information. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is also working on a digital Travel Pass platform\n\nEven when vaccines do become widely available, not everyone will take them and researchers are looking at whether the virus could be still be transmitted by vaccinated people. Masking, social distancing, sanitation and other safety layers will still be part of daily life -- and travel -- for a long time to come.\n\nTravel bubbles -- like the anticipated two-way corridor between New Zealand and Australia -- are among the tailored measures aimed at restoring some international travel. Jorge Fernández/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nMeasures in the meantime\n\nSeamless international travel won't happen overnight.\n\nEven as we wait for declines in coronavirus cases and more global coordination around safer, less confusing cross-border travel, destinations and corporations increasingly are rolling out their own interim solutions.\n\nDelta Air Lines is trying out a handful of Covid-tested, quarantine-free flights to the Netherlands. These flights employ a combination of the gold-standard PCR testing with preboarding rapid antigen testing.\n\nDe Oliveira sees rapid antigen testing as a potential aid in the industry's recovery. While considered less accurate , antigen tests are also much quicker and less expensive than molecular tests as one layer of risk management.\n\nIceland and Hungary have embraced the concept of immunity passports, allowing people to enter who have already been infected with Covid-19 and recovered.\n\nTravel bubbles, such as a much-anticipated, two-way corridor between New Zealand and Australia , allow people to travel back and forth between countries without quarantining.\n\nUnfortunately like most things Covid-related, these measures are subject to change.\n\nCorridors can be useful if they're consistent, but again, they've been up and down, opening and shutting at short notice and that has not helped consumers at all, said Paul Charles, the travel industry consultant.\n\nUltimately, travelers would like to get back to safely mixing and mingling with the rest of the world. ROBIN UTRECHT / Stringer / Getty\n\nThe great goal: Mingling with strangers\n\nThe UNWTO's Priante is hoping the ups and downs level out soon because the world is missing out.\n\nWhat I regret the most is that all that tourism is about, which is to trust the unknown ... the beauty of exploring, of meeting somebody you've never met before from another culture, another nation, is all sort of on hold and at stake because people are telling us 'don't trust anyone, cross the sidewalk, wear your mask, don't mingle,'  she said from her home in Madrid.\n\nAnd while Priante and her colleagues have taken every precaution and continued to travel and work to address the global crisis that is threatening livelihoods in the industry, she wants to see more people traveling safely.
Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday the federal government has the power to keep some sex offenders behind bars indefinitely after they have served their sentences if officials determine those inmates may prove sexually dangerous in the future.\n\nThe federal government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the 7-2 majority.\n\nAt issue was the constitutionality of federal civil commitment for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement or who are considered too mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n\nThe main plaintiff in the case, Graydon Comstock, was certified as dangerous six days before his 37-month federal prison term for processing child pornography was to end. Comstock and the others filing suit remain confined at Butner Federal Correctional Complex near Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThree other inmates who filed suit served prison terms of three to eight years for offenses ranging from child pornography to sexual abuse of a minor. Another was charged with child sex abuse but was declared mentally incompetent to face trial.\n\nAll were set to be released nearly three years ago, but government appeals have blocked their freedom. The government says about 83 people are being held under the civil commitment program.\n\nCorrections officials and prosecutors determined the men remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. The inmates' attorneys maintain the continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process and argue Congress overstepped its power by allowing inmates to be held for certain crimes that normally would fall under the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nThe law in question is the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which includes a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority by passing it, prompting the current high court appeal.\n\nThe statute is a 'necessary and proper' means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, Breyer wrote.\n\nBreyer equated the federal civil commitment law to Congress' long-standing authority to provide mental health care to prisoners in its custody, if they might prove dangerous, whether sexually or otherwise.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the federal government overstepped its bounds.\n\nCongress' power, however, is fixed by the Constitution, Thomas wrote. It does not expand merely to suit the states' policy preferences, or to allow state officials to avoid difficult choices regarding the allocation of state funds. He was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe case represented a victory for the federal government and the woman who argued the case on its behalf, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. President Obama nominated Kagan last week to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nA key lawmaker behind the Adam Walsh act applauded the ruling.\n\nThe court's holding today is a victory on behalf of the American people, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe process to enact this law to protect our children from those who would do them harm was difficult. I am heartened to see an overwhelming majority of the Supreme Court uphold this important child protection law.\n\nThe justices in April 2009 had blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who had served their federal sentences after the Obama administration claimed many of them remain sexually dangerous. Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the men be kept in custody while the case worked its way to the high court.\n\nMost violent sex offenses are handled at the state level, and at least 20 states run programs in which sexual predators are held indefinitely or until they are no longer considered dangerous. The federal government's civil commitment program is relatively new.\n\nThe Adam Walsh act was named after the son of John Walsh, host of TV's America's Most Wanted.Adam Walsh was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981.\n\nThe act also increased punishments for certain federal crimes against children and created a national registry for sex offenders. Those aspects of the bill were not being challenged in this case.
(CNN) — Bobbi Brown is best known for the beauty brand bearing her name. The minimalist, flattering eyeshadows and lipsticks won many busy working women as fans, but Brown sold the company to Estee Lauder in 2016 and has been looking for a new project ever since.\n\nThe answer came in a form she didn't expect -- a hotel in her pretty suburban New Jersey hometown.\n\nUnlike many in the beauty and fashion worlds, Brown was content not to be a regular on the New York City party scene, preferring a quieter life with her husband, developer Steven Plofker, and three sons in Montclair, about 45 minutes outside of Manhattan. Montclair is a picturesque, sleepy college town that refutes the cliche of New Jersey as dirty and industrial.\n\nDoes this mean that A-listers might abandon Manhattan for the 'burbs? Brown thinks it's worth taking the risk, and she spoke to CNN Travel about her new life as a hotelier.\n\nMeet George\n\nShades of gray: Brown obsessed over gray tones until she found the perfect ones. Photography by Lesley Unruh for One Kings Lane\n\nBrown didn't plan to get into hotels -- and she claims to have zero interest in building another brand. But after her youngest son went off to college and her husband began exploring a property in central Montclair, it seemed only natural for Brown and Plofker to merge their talents.\n\nEnter The George, a 32-room boutique hotel named after, and inspired by, George Washington. (The nation's first president spent lots of time in New Jersey.) It officially opens to the public on April 1, 2018.\n\nRelated content A night with the stars: 8 fabulous celebrity hotel suites\n\nLet me tell you, it was not easy having a very creative developer alongside someone who considers herself an expert in color, Brown laughs. [My husband and I have] been married 30 years in September. We raised three boys together. We have a happy marriage, but we're very strong-minded people and have learned when something is non-negotiable.\n\nAmong those non-negotiables? Dyson hair dryers and bathrobes from Ikea -- both things that Brown herself swears by and uses at home. She spent years traveling the world for her work and considers herself an expert on what hotels are doing right -- and what they're doing wrong.\n\nA few of her favorite things\n\nWhile the expensive Dyson hair dryers will have to be signed out from the front desk to prevent thievery, Brown had a very specific idea of which things guests would need in grabbing distance, namely coffee -- so there are Nespresso coffee makers in every room to prevent pre-caffeinated guests from having to interact with other humans.\n\nBrown, who loves the Soho House hotels around the world and opts for boutique stays over big-name brands with loyalty programs, also wanted to keep things personal. Since she has strong reactions to fragrances, she chose a delicate peppermint lavender scent for all the in-room toiletries, and has a policy against using perfumes or room sprays in common areas.\n\nJust like home: Many of The George's interiors come from Brown's home goods line with Lord & Taylor. Lesley Unruh\n\nWe're very hands-on people, Brown says about why the hotel project suited her and Plofker so well.\n\nI get into the details. We're going to be serving breakfast and brunch both to hotel guests and the community, we'll have an afternoon tea and smoothies. It matters what yogurt we serve. I will be curating everything, Brown says. It's a small hotel, so it's about customer experience and accommodating.\n\nAnd customer-friendly service doesn't just extend to guests of the human persuasion. Brown, a dog lover, has made The George extremely animal-friendly. Not only are there special doggie treats and beds, but travelers can pick out their pup's accessories (such as a food bowl) ahead of time when they make their reservation so that everything in the room will be ready to go upon arrival.\n\nAnother challenge for Brown and Plofker was negotiating Montclair's quirky local laws. The town has a very small number of liquor licenses, which can make it tough for a new bar or restaurant to open.\n\nWhile The George does not have one of those licenses, Brown has come up with creative ways to bring booze onto the property, such as having a favorite local wine store host on-site tastings. (The licenses are portable, which works out nicely.) Her team can also arrange for deliveries to individual guest rooms.\n\nThe hotel's small size also makes it easy to accommodate specific dietary needs, from gluten-free to diabetic-friendly.\n\nThe one thing The George will never have, though? A spa.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nHarvard professor Alan Dershowitz, a member of President Trump's legal team, offered a new defense of the President's actions with Ukraine, while answering senators' questions.\n\nIn a nutshell, Dershowitz argued that a US president is allowed to orchestrate a quid pro quo with a foreign leader to benefit their own re-election campaign, if they also believe that their re-election is in the national interests of the United States.\n\nDershowitz said: Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest. And mostly you're right — your election is in the public interest. And if a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\n\nThese comments could normalize the type of behavior that landed Trump in the middle of an impeachment scandal, and which Democrats say constitutes an improper solicitation of foreign influence into a US election.\n\nDershowitz offered this argument in response to a question from Republican Sen. Ted Cruz about the legality of a quid pro quo. Dershowitz said all elected officials make decisions through a political lens, and often hire pollsters to see how their decisions would play out.\n\nTrump's legal team does not concede that he attempted a quid pro quo. Dershowitz was speaking hypothetically. In his defense of Trump this week, Dershowitz has relied on controversial theories that are rejected by a wide cross-section of legal scholars.\n\nHow Democrats responded: Democrats later criticized Dershowitz, saying his theory would open the door to rampant abuses from future presidents.\n\nThey also rebutted Dershowitz's claims that presidents oversee this-for-that deals with foreign leaders all the time, in furtherance of their personal interests. When Vice President Joe Biden pushed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor, he was acting in accordance with established US policy, and promoting the views of international organizations like the IMF. Trump's team has argued, without providing credible evidence, that Biden actually did this to protect his son's corruption in Ukraine.\n\nWhat sets Trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the Ukraine aid was not in accordance with official US policy toward Ukraine. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with then-national security adviser John Bolton, all lobbied Trump to release the aid before he relented in September. Additionally, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office determined Trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that only the President sets foreign policy, not his advisers or lower-level diplomats
Story highlights Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease with poor prognosis Of nine patients, seven died during the reported 16-year period\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA cluster of cases of a progressive lung disease occurred among dentists and other dental workers treated at one Virginia care center, according to Thursday's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOf nine patients, referred to as a cluster, seven died during the reported 16-year period. The disease, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a chronic, progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. The cause is unknown.\n\nA cluster is a term used to define a collection of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, Dr. Randall J. Nett, lead author of the study and medical officer with the US Public Health Service, explained in an email.\n\nIn this case, among 894 patients treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the Virginia hospital, nine patients – or 1% – were identified as dentists or dental technicians. This number was about 23 times higher than expected, Nett said.\n\nAll the cluster patients – eight dentists and one dental technician – were men, with an average age of 64. Though the reason for illness has not been identified, occupational exposures are possible, Nett and his colleagues wrote.\n\nDentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work, Nett said. These exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards.\n\nOne of the surviving cluster patients reported polishing dental appliances and preparing impressions without using a mask or other protection, according to the report. During these tasks, a dental worker would have been exposed to silica and other compounds with known or potential respiratory toxicity.\n\nAt this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cases in dental personnel, said Nett, who recommended that workers wear certified respiratory protection if the ability to improve ventilation is not practical or effective.\n\nMore work has to be done before we can make any conclusions about the risk dentists or other dental personnel have, Nett said. CDC will follow up on this newly recognized cluster.\n\nAbout 650,000 dental personnel work throughout the nation, he said.\n\nDr. Paul Casamassimo, chief policy officer of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's Pediatric Oral Health & Research Center, said the new report is not surprising.\n\nFor years, dentists have been exposed to plaster and dust from drilling, in addition to the toxic substances listed in the report. The cluster patients were all older, so they may not have been using the most up-to-date practices for personal protection and safety, he noted.\n\nWe do work with materials and with human bioproducts that are potentially damaging to our bodies if we inhale them, Casamassimo said. Younger dentists are taught differently than in the past, so they know to delegate certain work or procedures to laboratories that meet more safe and stringent ventilation requirements, he said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nToday, dental personnel also have required protections from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, he said.\n\nHis own father was an old-school dentist.\n\nMy father passed away at 79, Casamassimo said. Though his father did not die of pulmonary fibrosis, he had respiratory problems.\n\nThis probably has been more common than we have known in the past, he said.
(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nThe old saying Cash is king might never have been as true as it is right now. While many people like to use their credit card to earn travel points or miles that they can redeem for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, those plans are on hold for many at the moment thanks to the pandemic.\n\nSo, instead of sticking with a credit card that earns rewards for a vacation that isn't happening in the near future, why not consider a credit card that earns you cash back almost instantly? Having money in your pocket today allows you to use that cash on anything you desire — or save it for the future.\n\nInterested? Then check out our list of the best cash back credit cards to decide which one will best fit your needs.\n\nThe best cash back credit cards of 2021\n\nCiti® Double Cash Card: Best overall card for cash back\n\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Best for US supermarkets\n\nChase Freedom Flex: Best for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi: Best for gas purchases\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited: Best for flexibility\n\nInk Business Unlimited Credit Card: Best for small businesses\n\nDiscover it® Cash Back: Best sign-up bonus\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature® Card: Best for streaming\n\nBank of America® Cash Rewards credit card: Best for travel\n\nThe information for the Discover it Cash Back, U.S. Bank Cash+ and Bank of America Cash Rewards cards has been collected independently by CNN Underscored. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\n\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\n\nCiti Double Cash\n\nBest overall card for cash back\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\n\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\n\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\n\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\n\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\n\nBest for US supermarkets\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\n\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\n\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nPurchase protection and return protection.\n\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\n\nTerms apply.\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\n\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\n\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\n\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\n\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\n\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\n\nChase Freedom Flex\n\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\n\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\n\nCell phone protection.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\n\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\n\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\n\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa\n\nBest for gas purchases\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\n\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\n\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\n\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\n\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\n\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\n\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\n\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\n\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\n\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nBest for flexibility\n\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\n\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\n\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\n\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\nBest for small businesses\n\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\n\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\n\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\n\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\n\nPrimary rental car insurance.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\n\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\n\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\n\nDiscover it Cash Back\n\nBest sign-up bonus\n\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\n\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\n\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\n\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\n\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\n\nBest for streaming\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\n\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\n\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\n\nCell Phone Providers\n\nDepartment Stores\n\nElectronics Stores\n\nHome Utilities\n\nFurniture Stores\n\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\n\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\n\nGrocery Stores\n\nGas Stations\n\nRestaurants\n\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nBank of America Cash Rewards\n\nBest for travel\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\n\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\n\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\n\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\n\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\n\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\n\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

(CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country is developing new weaponry including a nuclear-powered submarine, tactical nuclear weapons and advanced warheads designed to penetrate missile defense systems.\n\nIn comments published Saturday, Kim said North Korea is pushing ahead with the armaments to deter the United States, comments that appear to show President Donald Trump's strategy of high-level engagement with Pyongyang -- including three historic in-person meetings between Trump and Kim -- failed to convince Pyongyang to stop its pursuit of a modern nuclear arsenal.\n\nNo matter who is in power in the US, the true nature and the true spirit of the anti-North Korea policy will never change, Kim said, according to the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nThe development of nuclear weapons be pushed forward without interruption.\n\nThe projects, according to Kim, are at various stages of development. He said multiple-warhead guidance technology is in the final stage, while studies in hypersonic flight that could be applied to new ballistic missiles are complete, with North Korea making preparations for their test and production -- a possible sign that Pyongyang may be on the verge of resuming the type of missile testing anathema to Washington and Seoul.\n\nImprovements in tactical nuclear weapons -- which are meant to be used at shorter range and are often less destructive than strategic nuclear weapons -- are also being finalized, Kim said. Nuclear-powered submarine research appears to be the least far along. Research into these subs is complete and in the final stages of examination, Kim said.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends the Party Congress in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Tuesday.\n\nRead More
(CNN Business) Parler, the alternative social media platform favored by the far-right, sued Amazon on Monday in response to being deplatformed, alleging an antitrust violation, breach of contract and interference with the company's business relationships with users.\n\nAmazon AMZN The complaint asks a federal court for a temporary restraining order (TRO) againstand calls Amazon Web Services' decision a death blow to Parler.\n\nWithout AWS, Parler is finished as it has no way to get online, the complaint said. And a delay of granting this TRO by even one day could also sound Parler's death knell as President Trump and others move on to other platforms.\n\nParler's lawsuit argues that Amazon has unlawfully sought to restrain competition by eliminating a player from the market.\n\nIt also claims Amazon breached its contract with Parler by not providing Parler 30 days' notice of termination -- and that its actions interfere with Parler's relationships with current and future users.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nMichigan State University fostered a culture that was more focused on protecting the school than the survivors of serial abuser Larry Nassar, a report released Thursday by the Michigan House of Representatives said.\n\nState lawmakers conducted their own investigation of MSU's handling of complaints against the former sports doctor to identify possible policy solutions. The House sent their findings to law enforcement for consideration in the Michigan Attorney General's investigation of MSU's handling of the Nassar case.\n\nPHOTO: JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Larry Nassar\n\nThe Attorney General appreciates the work done by the Michigan House of Representatives, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The investigative team will be reviewing the report.\n\nThe report marks the first time the state legislature has commented publicly on the Nassar case. It is one of many steps taken by lawmakers and law enforcement to figure out how multiple institutions failed hundreds of Nassar's victims – many of them minors – for over 30 years. Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for his crimes in both Ingham and Eaton counties.\n\nMichigan State spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said the university will continue cooperating with lawmakers to create improvements and changes with the hopes of preventing tragedies like this from ever happening again.\n\nThese are some of the report's findings:\n\n243 people have reported Nassar to MSU since 2014\n\nFrom 2014 to the present, 243 people reported abuse to the Michigan State University Police Department, according to the report. Most of those who reported abuse were minors at the time.\n\nThe House report also noted that 91 other Title IX complaints were filed against Nassar since Rachel Denhollander filed a Title IX complaint against him in 2016. Denhollander spoke to the Indianoplis Star in 2016, and, after her interview, many others came forward to tell their own stories of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of Nassar.\n\nMSU 'failed to properly investigate'\n\nAmanda Thomashow, a former MSU student, filed a Title IX complaint against Nassar in 2014. The school conducted an investigation and determined that Nassar's conduct did not violate the school's sexual harassment policy.\n\nBut the House report states that MSU failed to properly investigate Thomashow's complaint for a number of reasons.\n\nFor one, the investigation was based on flawed testimony from biased medical experts, the report said. Each expert worked with Nassar or knew him personally, and Nassar handpicked one of them, according to the report.\n\nMoreover, the experts' explanations were fallacious at best and only provided circular justifications for what Nassar claimed were legitimate medical treatments, the report states.\n\nThe report also points out that Thomashow received a different final report than Nassar. Thomashow's report did not include the new requirements Nassar would need to follow when practicing similar procedures on patients. Nassar's did. The discrepancy demonstrates an office culture more focused on protecting the institution than survivors, the report states.\n\nMSU 'defiantly' stands by its 2014 investigation\n\nThe report notes that MSU continues to defiantly and wrongfully maintain it did not mishandle the 2014 Title IX investigation. MSU still defends the conclusions of their 2014 investigation, arguing that the facts of Thomashow's case were materially different from a later investigation, which reached the opposite conclusion, the report states.\n\nNassar didn't keep medical records on everything\n\nMedical records for many of what Nassar called his treatments were not kept, the report found. In the medical records that were kept, they didn't include any mention of or reference to the more sensitive parts of his treatments, like intravaginal penetration.\n\nIn other cases, MSU destroyed medical records of people who reported abuse or harassment to MSU police later, but they were all destroyed in accordance with state law and MSU's record retention policy, according to the report.\n\nNassar grew more comfortable with abuse over time\n\nWhile Nassar initially took more care to make his treatments seem medically appropriate when he began these treatments in the 1990s, as time went on, he grew more comfortable with his conduct. Initially, Nassar would explain the procedure and demonstrate on a pelvic model.\n\nBy the 2000s, he would only mention to victims that he was going to adjust the pelvic bones. By 2014, he felt comfortable enough to abuse his patients without any prior explanation when performing the treatment, according to the report.\n\nBy 2016, he was self-assured enough to readily admit to investigators that he 'does not get written consent from the patient before treatment' and even testified that 'unless the patient stops him, he is assuming the patient understand.' \n\nMSU sexual assault and harassment policies are changing\n\nMSU has changed a number of policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment and assault since Nassar was suspended from MSU in 2016. The Office of Institutional Equity, the office within the university that handles Title IX complaints, only had three staff members in the 2014-2015 academic year, the staff increased to seven the following year. The office now has ten full time staff members, according to the report.\n\nCNN's Linh Tran and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.
Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nRolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nBut if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nIf the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\nGiven how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nThe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\nTax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nIf they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under Senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what Ryan wants.\n\nThe White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\nDespite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.

(CNN) The Rev. Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday, a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party appears closer to retaking the US Senate, as Georgia Republican David Perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. Both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but CNN has not yet called the race.\n\nWarnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.\n\nI am an iteration and an example of the American dream, the senator-elect told CNN's John Berman Wednesday morning on New Day. He added, When I think about the arc of our history, what Georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\n\nAfter no Georgia Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\n\nTrump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused.\n\nBut despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in objecting to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.\n\nThe American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed, said Loeffler in a statement on Monday.\n\nAsked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, Warnock told CNN Wednesday that his opponent has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\n\nWhat is unfolding in the Senate today or in the House, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. It's a distraction, he told Berman. These senators know better and the people that I'm talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives.\n\nWhile Georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the Republican candidates came into the Senate runoff elections with an advantage.\n\nIn November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).\n\nRepublicans hoped their message that Georgia should be a check on Washington would prove successful, noting that if Warnock and Ossoff win, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be in charge.\n\nWe're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party, said Eric Tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, before Election Day. That could be wishful thinking on my part. But I do think that that's going to be a big motivator.\n\nBut Republicans are worried that Trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the Senate, even though the state has not elected a Democrat to the chamber since 2000.\n\nHeath Garrett, a campaign manager for former Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, told CNN that Trump's attacks on Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base Republicans to go vote, and said they've threw Perdue and Loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.\n\nSenator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are being whipsawed by the President on one side and by the Democratic money on the other side, he said.\n\nPerdue and Loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by Trump by focusing on Ossoff and Warnock.\n\nPerdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.\n\nWe win Georgia, we save America, Perdue told the camera.\n\nThe Democratic candidates counter that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\n\nThey argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they've attacked the Republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWarnock told CNN Wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new Senate's top priority.\n\nThe special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when GOP Rep. Doug Collins forced Loeffler, who Kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.\n\nAfter no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as Loeffler portrayed Warnock an anti-police Marxist who would destroy America in the Senate.\n\nWe have to have Georgians come out and vote because we know that Chuck Schumer's radical agents of change are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, said Loeffler on the campaign trail Monday. They would defund the police. They would lock down our economy. And we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in Georgia.\n\nWarnock has in turn promoted his background from the Savannah projects to the pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic church, while firing back at Loeffler.\n\nKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said Warnock in an ad. She's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\n\nPerdue, a 71-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, has dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the Democrat does not know how to create a job. At their debate in the fall, Ossoff called the senator a crook who was fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading while attacking the health of the people who he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China -- claims Ossoff called ridiculous.\n\nThe Georgia US Senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia.\n\nWe've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open ... Republicans are expected to have a strong Election Day, said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights organization founded by Abrams.\n\nPolitical groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, averaging more than $8 million per day. Republicans outspent Democrats by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWith the Senate on the line, Trump rallied his supporters in northwest Georgia on Monday, while President-elect Joe Biden held an event in Atlanta.\n\nBiden said electing Ossoff and Warnock would end the gridlock in Washington and allow Congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans. Trump urged the state to elect Perdue and Loeffler, and claimed that Biden would not take the White House.\n\nWe're going to fight like hell, said the President.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

In addition to seeking bipartisan solutions to immigration reform, Trump advocated for the reintroduction of earmarks as a way to break the legislative stalemate in Congress. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nEditor's Note: Fernand Fernandez is the interim president and CEO of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the country's largest Hispanic business association. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLast September, when President Trump moved to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congress was given until March 5 to pass a permanent, legislative solution. This week, that deadline passed. Were it not for a federal judge's ruling that the program must at least temporarily continue, 800,000 DACA recipients would be at risk of deportation.\n\nPHOTO: Sheryl Lanzel Fernand Fernandez\n\nThough the termination of DACA has been delayed by the federal court, the legal stability of DACA status is not guaranteed. The ruling that is protecting DACA recipients could be overturned by an appeal process, just as the executive order that created the program was subsequently overturned with a change in presidential administration. In order to permanently secure the legal status of Dreamers, DACA or a similar act must be enacted as law.\n\nOur leaders in Congress have an excellent opportunity to pass a bipartisan solution that has the overwhelming support of the American public. In fact, a poll last September by ABC/Washington Post shows that 86% of Americans want Dreamers to stay. Instead of wrongfully conflating the fate of Dreamers with totally separate issues such as national security, our elected officials should be jumping at the chance to create substantive, meaningful change just before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nDACA has long been framed as a humanitarian issue. The moral case is clear. The individuals who immigrated to the United States as children did not intentionally violate immigration law and should not be punished for the actions of their parents. They have grown up in American schools, pledged allegiance to the American flag and are contributing to the American workforce. The United States is the only home they know.\n\nAt the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, we recognize that DACA is also an economic issue. The contributions of Dreamers to our economy cannot be overstated. They contribute over $40 billion each year to our gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report from the American Action Forum.\n\nDACA-eligible immigrants pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. One study indicates that 97% of DACA recipients are in school or employed.\n\nAmerica depends on Dreamers, many of whom give back to their communities. Approximately 9,000 DACA recipients are serving as teachers. An additional 14,000 work in health care services. To threaten the legal status of DACA recipients is not only a disservice to the individuals contributing to our economy and society, but also to the greater United States.\n\nThe state of Arizona, for example, has approximately 27,000 DACA recipients. If Arizona's DACA recipients were forced to leave, the state's GDP would drop by $1.3 billion. If Texas's 124,300 DACA recipients were deported, Texas GDP would drop by nearly $6.3 billion.

Alabama, which is one of the most profitable college football programs in the country, defends its title against Clemson on Monday night.\n\nA win could bring in even more money for the school.\n\nThe Crimson Tide's football program reported $103.9 million in revenue for 2016 and posted a $47 million profit. That's up 3.6% from last year.\n\nTicket sales account for a big chunk of those earnings, and another championship title will probably mean even stronger ticket sales for next season.\n\nMerchandise revenue will also get a big boost -- Alabama has a lucrative deal with Collegiate Licensing Company. It's netted $98 million in royalties since the company was founded in 1981 by Alabama's current athletic director, Bill Battle. Alabama was the company's first client and is its top seller, with licensing fees skyrocketing 250% since 2005. Battle no longer runs the company.\n\nRelated: Clemson is covered -- win or lose\n\nTicket prices for Monday night's game hit a record high. The average resale ticket price was $3,053 as of Saturday, according to TicketIQ. The cheapest ticket to get into the game on the Alabama side was $1,794. On Clemson's side, the cheapest tickets cost $2,600.\n\nWhile these prices won't affect 2016 profits, they'll translate into more money for the program going forward.\n\nAs a Division I school, Alabama also gets a cut of ESPN's 12-year deal for the rights to broadcast the playoffs, which is worth $7.3 billion.\n\nWith all the money Alabama makes, it can afford to pay its head football coach well. Nick Saban, the second-highest paid college coach in the country, made $6.9 million in 2016. Michigan's Jim Harbaugh made $9 million.\n\nIn addition to his CEO-like salary, Saban has postseason bonuses built into his contract, which he'll receive whether the team wins or loses. Other coaches and select staff members will also receive bonuses.\n\nRelated: Ticket prices for Alabama-Clemson championship game hit a record\n\nStaff bonuses are just part of the expenses of playing in a championship game. Clemson, which narrowly lost to Alabama in the 2016 title game, took out an insurance policy this year to help cover the cost of what it hoped would be a rematch.\n\nAlabama, which has won four national championships in the last seven years, didn't need insurance.\n\nIn the words of Battle, Alabama feels like self-insuring is a better bet.\n\nBattle said Alabama budgets for postseason expenses like bowl and championship games so spending on insurance doesn't make sense.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen traded sharp words in a rare, feisty exchange with a congressman over legislation that could limit the central bank's independence.\n\nThe normally reserved Yellen pushed back against pointed questions from Bill Posey, a Florida Republican. He asked why she's opposed to a bill that would allow the Government Accountability Office, a unit of Congress, to audit the Fed, and, more controversially, review its decisions on interest rates.\n\nPosey said the bill, known as Audit the Fed, would provide more transparency for the central bank and its decisions. Fed leaders say it would ruin the central bank's credibility by eliminating its independence.\n\nIn January 2017 a version of the Audit the Fed bill was introduced in both chambers. It passed out of committees in both the House and the Senate, but neither version has received a full vote in either the House or the Senate. Few think it will pass the Senate.\n\nRelated: Fed Chief: Trump policies are a source of uncertainty\n\nFor the life of me, I can't understand what the Fed fears. Can you give me an example that would justify the lack of transparency? Posey asked at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nWe don't have a lack of transparency, Yellen quickly replied.\n\nYou do if you can't audit it -- that's a lack of transparency, Posey shot back.\n\nFed leaders do make their decisions behind closed doors. But the central bank is audited twice a year -- once by the government through the Fed's inspector general and once by a private auditor. Critics of the bill question the point of a third audit.\n\nRight now, GAO officials don't attend Fed meetings and are unable to second-guess its decisions. Yellen argues that the proposed law would give them that power.\n\nRelated: Fed raises rates in June\n\nPosey pressed on.\n\nWhat do you fear about the audit? Can you give me a real-time example? he said.\n\nYellen replied that central bank leaders need privacy to discuss monetary policy without being second-guessed in real time by officials representing lawmakers.\n\nPosey wasn't satisfied. Just give me an example -- give me an example -- of how transparency could hurt the Fed? Just give me one example, he asked, holding up his index finger.\n\nYellen started: Because what you're talking about with the GAO are policy reviews ...\n\nPosey cut her off. No, just give me an example.\n\nShe did: I would envision a situation where the GAO, at the request of members of Congress, might come in and say at our meeting a week ago ... they believe the decision we made was the wrong one at that particular meeting, and I would say that's an extreme interference into monetary policy.\n\nPosey replied: So you're telling me we shouldn't be transparent for the fear of being second-guessed or somebody criticizing you because they thought you were wrong?\n\nWhat we're talking about is political interference in decision-making by the [Fed's] committee, Yellen said.\n\nI don't see that, Posey said.\n\nI do, Yellen shot back.\n\nWell, give me an example, Posey asked again.\n\nI gave you an example, Yellen said, sharply.\n\nPosey ran out of time, and the hearing moved on.\n\nYellen's testimony before the House on Wednesday may have been her last. Her term ends in February, and it's unclear whether President Trump will reappoint her. House leaders repeatedly asked Yellen whether she wants to say on, and she declined to comment.
The U.S. tax code overhaul will result in a tax cut for nearly two-thirds of U.S. households in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut the average tax cut will vary by state depending on economic and demographic characteristics, and whether residents pay high state and local taxes, which are now capped as a deduction on one's federal return.\n\nThe map below indicates the average tax cut in each state as measured across all filers in that state – those getting a tax cut, those facing a tax increase and those who will see no change at all. Only a small minority of filers will owe more in federal taxes, ranging from a low of 2.8% of residents in West Virginia to a high of 10.2% in New Jersey.\n\nWhile a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. For example, Mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. But that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income.
SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (CNN) -- Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joe Biden to the nation as his running mate Saturday, telling supporters that he is a leader who is ready to step in and be president.\n\nFor months, I've searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making Washington work for the American people. I searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first, Obama said.\n\nToday, I've come back to Springfield to tell you I've found that leader, he said.\n\nThe rally is the pair's first joint appearance since Obama announced that Biden, the senior U.S. senator from Delaware, would be his running mate on his Web site and in a text message to supporters early Saturday morning. Watch Obama introduce his running mate »\n\nDemocrats hope that Biden's working-class roots and foreign policy experience will help Obama, who informed Biden of his decision Thursday.\n\nThousands of cheering supporters gathered Saturday for the rally in Springfield, Illinois, where Obama announced his candidacy last year. It will be their only public appearance together before next week's Democratic convention in Denver. Watch what Biden would bring to an Obama presidency »\n\nAs he took to the podium at Saturday's rally, Biden invoked the 16th U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, who was from Illinois.\n\nPresident Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm, said Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nToday in Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place, and I'm proud to stand firm with the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nObama stressed those roots, introducing 65-year-old Biden as still that scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds.\n\nHe noted hardships in Biden's life, including the deaths of Biden's first wife and infant daughter in a 1972 car wreck and his struggle to overcome a brain aneurysm in 1988. iReport.com: iReporters ask if Biden was really the best choice\n\nThat's the kind of fighter I want by my side in the months and years to come, Obama said.\n\nKnown for his plain-spoken approach and penchant for speaking from the cuff, Biden wasted little time taking to the traditional vice presidential candidate's role of political attack dog.\n\nJohn McCain ... served our country with extreme courage, and I know he wants to do right by America, he said of his Senate colleague and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But the harsh truth is loud and clear: You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time.\n\nHe also seized on a McCain comment from this week when he could not remember how many houses he owns and said McCain was out of touch with the kitchen-table issues that working families face.\n\nIt's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at, Biden said.\n\nThe McCain campaign quickly pounced Obama for introducing Biden as the next president of the United States before quickly correcting himself to say vice president. Watch McCain's new ad targeting Biden »\n\nBarack Obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor, when he introduced Joe Biden as the next president, McCain spokesman Ben Porritt said. The reality is that nothing has changed since Joe Biden first made his assessment that Barack Obama is not ready to lead. He wasn't ready then and he isn't ready now.\n\nBiden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, brings decades of experience that could help counter GOP attacks on Obama's lack of experience in foreign policy.\n\nBiden abandoned his own White House run after a poor showing in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. He also ran for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out after charges of plagiarism in a stump speech. Learn more about Biden\n\nBiden is serving out his sixth term, making him Delaware's longest-serving senator.\n\nHe is married and has three children. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and got a law degree from Syracuse.\n\nOne of Biden's grandfathers was a Pennsylvania state senator, according to the Almanac of American Politics.\n\nBiden will make his first big speech as the vice presidential candidate Wednesday, the third night of the Democratic convention.\n\nAll About Joseph Biden • Barack Obama • John McCain
This was excerpted from the January 4 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n\n(CNN) If the anti-democratic plotting taking place in Washington right now were unfolding in a developing nation, the United States would no doubt lead the condemnation.\n\nImagine: A raging president refuses to accept that his rule is ending and incites mass protests to disrupt the certification of his election loss. A radicalized band of loyalist lawmakers also tries to deny voters' verdict . The wannabe autocrat leans on a party subordinate to find enough votes to let him win. Propagandistic media organs spew misinformation to support the his lies. Meanwhile the real crisis — a once-in-a-century pandemic that kills 3,000 citizens each day — is ignored in a gross display of negligence.\n\nWere this anywhere else, the US State Department would issue a statement calling for the restoration of democratic principles and good governance. The President might make a disapproving comment in a press conference, and legislators might call for sanctions. But they can't, because the turmoil is here at home, wracking world's oldest democracy and undermining America's claim to be a moral example and advocate for free people worldwide.\n\nWhen Congress meets on Wednesday to certify the presidential election results, more than half of the elected Republicans in the House and a quarter of their number in the Senate are expected to support an effort to raise baseless claims of mass voter fraud. They won't stop President-elect Joe Biden from becoming President. But they will cement a false belief among millions of Trump voters that the election was stolen.\n\nBefore that, two Senate runoffs in Georgia Tuesday will decide whether Democrats can achieve a 50-50 split in the chamber. If so, Biden's party will have the advantage of Vice President-to-be Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote. But a thin Republican majority would create huge friction on Biden's administration, complicating efforts to confirm cabinet nominees, secure a new stimulus plan and money to fix a botched vaccine rollout, and to advance big goals in climate policy, health care and rebuilding US infrastructure.\n\nRead More
Protesters around the world disrupted Black Friday shopping in order to draw attention to climate change days before the United Nations met to discuss the issue in Madrid.\n\nThe retail holiday saw protests in a long list of countries -- including France, Germany, the United States -- with some activists entering stores and others holding mock funerals. Near Paris, climate demonstrators blocked a shopping mall and gathered in from of Amazon's headquarters to protest over-production they say is killing the planet.\n\nTo many activists, Black Friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost U.S. retailers ahead of the Christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok.\n\nWe are living in a system of endless consumerism, the group Extinction Rebellion NYC tweeted on Friday. Earth cannot sustain that, especially as we accelerate towards climate and ecological catastrophe.\n\nHARVARD-YALE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTEST AT FOOTBALL GAME SEES 42 CHARGED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe group posted photos and videos purportedly showing activists protesting the holiday.\n\nProtesters also reportedly shut down streets in Vancouver, Canada for a mock funeral procession.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, a group that's helped promote the Green New Deal, swarmed the large Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS TURN UP THE HEAT ON ELECTED DEMS, CRITICIZE INACTION\n\nIn Washington, D.C., actress Jane Fonda led yet another protest as part of a series called Fire Drill Fridays. In a post retweeted by Fonda, the group cliamed that 38 people were arrested demanding food justice. Activists also reportedly planned to hold a Black Friday Funeral for the Future on Capitol Hill in order to eulogize and mourn all that has been lost and all that is threatened by the climate crisis.\n\nClimate change protests seemed to intensify in the fall with thousands skipping school during September's climate strike. Activist Greta Thunberg also appeared at a United Nations meeting where she vehemently denounced politicians for inaction on climate change.\n\nAnd last week, nearly 260 groups sent a letter requesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Ill., pursue policies like the Green New Deal instead of incremental or isolated policy tweaks.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT BLASTS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS FOR DELAYING HARVARD-YALE FOOTBALL GAME WITH 'EMPTY ACTIVISM'\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the group Extinction Rebellion held a hunger strike in an attempt to force the speaker into a video-recorded meeting. When they realized she was planning to leave D.C., the protesters attempted to storm past her office's entrance and into a broader room where her chief of staff sat.\n\nAlso last week, climate protesters delayed a Harvard-Yale football game when they occupied the field and demanded the Ivy League schools divest from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe disruptions will likely continue as the United Nations meets to discuss the issue in Madrid on Monday.\n\nThe United Nations offered what it called bleak findings Tuesday as it warned that the world was headed toward global extinction and would need to increase its efforts fivefold if nations wanted to reach the temperature reduction goal outlined in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nAGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED\n\nThe United States recently filed paperwork to officially remove itself from the multilateral agreement. Conservatives, meanwhile, have warned about economic consequences of large-scale reform and pointed to failed, historical climate predictions as reasons for avoiding drastic change.\n\nAccording to AP, Quang Paasch of the activist group Fridays for Future said governments attending next week's annual climate conference should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn Berlin, about two dozen environmental activists jumped into the chilly waters of the Spree river in front of parliament to protest a government-backed package of measures they say won't be enough to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The package was blocked Friday by Germany's upper house, which represents the country's 16 states.\n\nLater, tens of thousands of students rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
President Trump is deranged, unhinged, dangerous, and deserving of prosecution, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says in an interview scheduled to air Sunday night on 60 Minutes.\n\nThe San Francisco Democrat sat down for a conversation with Lesley Stahl of the CBS News program last week following Wednesday's siege of the U.S. Capitol by a crowd of protesters.\n\nIs anybody running the executive branch of the government? Who is running the executive branch? Stahl asks in a preview clip released by CBS, implying that Trump may have abdicated his position in the waning days of his term following criticism over the Capitol security breach.\n\nWell, sadly, the person who's running the executive branch is a deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the United States, Pelosi asserts in response.\n\nAnd we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him. But he has done something so serious that there should be prosecution against him.\n\nPELOSI: CAPITOL RIOTERS CHOSE THEIR 'WHITENESS' OVER DEMOCRACY\n\nPelosi, 80, of course, is a frequent target of ire from President Trump and other Republicans, along with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democrats' leader in the other chamber of Congress. The GOP typically regards Democratic policy proposals as unnecessary, expensive, overly restrictive – or some combination thereof.\n\n'Fire Pelosi'\n\nAt a Trump rally near the White House that preceded the Capitol siege, Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican and vocal Trump supporter, wore a red cap saying Fire Pelosi, when he addressed the crowd on Wednesday.\n\nIn separate remarks Saturday, in an online meeting with her San Francisco constituents, Pelosi characterized the Capitol siege in racial terms, accusing the participants of having chosen their Whiteness over a regard for American democracy.\n\nIt has been an epiphany for the world to see that there are people in our country led by this president, for the moment, who have chosen their Whiteness over democracy, Pelosi said, according to The Associated Press.\n\n'Nothing is off the table'\n\nLater in the 60 Minutes clip, Stahl then inquires whether lawmakers have declared the 25th Amendment of the Constitution – which outlines steps for removal of a sitting president – off the table in their conversations about how to react to Trump after the Capitol riot.\n\nNo, it isn't. Nothing is off the table, Pelosi answered.\n\nWHAT IS THE 25TH AMENDMENT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nIn another CBS preview clip, Pelosi describes her experience inside the Capitol as protesters were gathering outside and then entering the building.\n\nI was pulled from the podium, just literally pulled from the podium, Pelosi says, presumably referring to Capitol security personnel.\n\nThe volatile situation saw lawmakers – Pelosi among them – seeking cover inside the building as protesters ran roughshod through hallways and even into lawmakers' offices.\n\nThey were vocally saying, 'Where's the speaker? We know she has staff. They're here someplace. We're going to find them, Pelosi tells Stahl, though it was unclear whether the speaker was referring to security personnel or to members of the crowd.\n\nNews coverage of the siege included at least two widely distributed photos linked to Pelosi: In one shot, a man is seen carrying a podium that authorities said was from Pelosi's office, and in another shot a different man is seen seated inside Pelosi's office, with his left foot up on one of the desks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth men have reportedly been arrested in connection with the siege:\n\nThe man seen carrying the podium has been identified by authorities as Adam Christian Johnson, 36, who was apprehended in Pinellas County, Fla. The Justice Department said Johnson has been charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; one count of theft of government property; and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n\nThe man seen seated in Pelosi's office has been identified by authorities as Richard Barnett, 60, of Gravette, Ark. He has been charged with violent entry and theft of public property, among other offenses, and was expected to be extradited to Washington after his arrest in Arkansas, authorities told Fox News.\n\nFox News' Audrey Conklin and Louis Casiano and The Associated Press contributed to this story.
Like millions of victims of rampant gun crime in Brazil, Claudio Sotero Júnior is clear about what he wants: his own gun.\n\nHis store near São Paulo selling bodybuilding supplements has been robbed at gunpoint six times since he opened it in 2006. Three years ago, the 41-year-old had to give up teaching kickboxing classes to pick up his wife from work every day after gunmen robbed and sexually assaulted her at a bus stop.\n\nIf it weren't for Brazil's strict firearms legislation, he said, he'd buy a Glock pistol to keep at work, and guns for his wife, sister and parents to defend themselves in what has become the world's most murderous country.\n\nBrazil racked up nearly 64,000 homicides in 2017, the highest overall number in the world. Over 70% of those were committed with firearms, widely available to criminals on the black market. Here in São Paulo, a megalopolis of 12 million people, over a quarter of residents say they have been held up at gunpoint at some moment in their lives, according to a study this year by the city's business school Insper.\n\nIt's not fair, we've become hostages in our own country, said Mr. Sotero Júnior. We can't take it anymore.\n\nNow, Brazil is set to embark on an experiment that will determine what happens when you loosen gun restrictions in a country battling an overpowering wave of gun crime.\n\nTo read more from The Wall Street Journal, click here.
According to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic has been worthy of many rewards: A New York Times bestseller on leadership, a COVID mountain poster he commissioned to be made and sold, an Emmy, a Ted Kennedy award and a birthday party that you could attend virtually for $1,000 with a check made out to the Andrew Cuomo reelection campaign.\n\nIf you ask those who lost loved ones in nursing homes, as my family did in 2020, his leadership has been a failure starting with his March 25 order to put COVID positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days, and the subsequent cover-up of the total number of seniors we've lost since then.\n\nIf Cuomo had not spent valuable time promoting and celebrating himself for months, missing meetings with the White House in the fall and instead had prepared for the massive vaccine roll-out here in New York, maybe we wouldn't have the mess and mass confusion that is currently happening across the state.\n\nOne of the biggest problems we're facing right now is the complicated hierarchy that's been created designating who gets the vaccine first, and the very strict fines that are being implemented for hospitals who gave shots to anyone not on a prioritized list.\n\nCUOMO'S NURSING HOME CORONAVIRUS POLICY: ADMIN REFUSES RECORD REQUESTS FOR STUDY ABSOLVING HIM ON DEATHS\n\nEven the New York Times has been getting tough with its headlines on what was happening:\n\nNew York's strict vaccine guidelines forced one clinic to throw away doses after it couldn't find eligible people\n\nWhy 300 doses of vaccine sat unused in freezer for 2 weeks…\n\nOnce the vaccine distribution plan began, people started to notice who took priority first, and who wasn't being included. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noticed that some first responders and those over the age of 70 were not at the front of the line:\n\nWe are not allowed by state law to give a single shot to a single New Yorker over 75. He announced in a tweet.\n\nThe mayor went on talk shows and social media to ask why his own father wasn't allowed to get vaccinated yet and listened to many senior citizens raising their voices as to why they couldn't be prioritized for the vaccine since they were clearly the ones who needed it most.\n\nCUOMO'S BOOK TOUTING 'LEADERSHIP' DURING PANDEMIC RELEASED JUST BEFORE HUGE SPIKE IN COVID CASES, PUNDIT NOTES\n\nThe shaming worked, and suddenly, Cuomo announced that the elderly and city workers were now included. He said in a press conference on Friday:\n\nOn Monday, you can start to schedule appointments. Pharmacies will start coming online, some on Monday, more on Wednesday…\n\nBut the governor never officially said when they could begin or how the registration would happen.\n\nNY GOV. CUOMO'S TONE SHIFTS AFTER MONTHS OF CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS\n\nOver the weekend we started to see reports about what a massive undertaking this distribution is and who might have a problem signing up.\n\nIn a series of tweets New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer wrote that the process of making appointments for the vaccination is complicated and buggy. Especially for people over 75:\n\nThe @nychealthy site has a multi-step verification process just to set up an account, and then a six-step process to set up an appointment. Along the way, there are as many as 51 questions of fields in addition to uploading images of your insurance card.\n\nAll of this will be particularly challenging for populations that struggle with digital literacy and digital access – who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and who need to vaccine the most.\n\nNew York Assemblyman Ron Kim, who is the chairman of the Aging Committee tweeted in response to Stringer's tweet:\n\nFirst, it should be a two-step verification process to vaccinate older adults. But fixing hospital vaccination screening process is not the issue. Why did the governor punt this to underfunded hospitals in the first place? Why didn't the governor trust local protocols?\n\nKim told me in a text that he had informally surveyed some doctors and asked them why they thought the governor decided to trust hospitals to vaccinate the population. He says they overwhelmingly told him it's to make private hospitals look good.\n\nCRITICS MOCK NY GOV. CUOMO'S SUDDEN DENUNCIATION OF LOCKDOWNS, SUGGEST TRUMP HACKED HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT\n\nBill Hammond is the Senior Fellow for Health Policy at Empire Center and has been one of the biggest advocates on transparency with the Cuomo administration.\n\nI asked him in a text why this is so hard to do.\n\nGetting 8.3 million New York City residents organized to do anything is going to be hard. I'm struck by the lack of preparation. They could have foreseen the need for a registration system months ago. As it is, they seem to be managing things on the fly.\n\nHammond says he can see why they would want people to register for an appointment, to avoid crowding at vaccination sites. But if you're going to do that, it needs to be as simple as possible.\n\nIdeally, there would be one system for the city, and maybe the whole state. Instead, it looks like we will have three.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nI then asked him why the governor decided to put this all on the shoulders of the hospital system.\n\nHere's his answer:\n\nHe evidently decided [that] they and their members (who are after all very smart and capable organizations) were better prepared to handle this job than city and county officials. The city's website rollout is probably the kind of thing he was worried about. But hospitals can't do everything. They have no particular experience of running mass vaccinations.\n\nThere are many reports showing every county in New York State has been planning and rehearsing this process of mass vaccinations for years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHammond thinks the preparations never included setting up websites, and that it's better handled statewide. But, the governor should've known how hard this would be from the beginning.\n\nHe should have been working on exactly these issues since the summer or early fall. Not involving the counties — who had already done some the prep work — seems like a major mistake, he told me.\n\nAdd this to the list of the many mistakes the governor has made over the last 10 months, but won't answer for. He seemed to escape widespread criticism of his lethal executive order in March and the thousands of seniors who subsequently died. But maybe now people are taking notice:\n\nChris @MasterJohn wrote:\n\nIf Cuomo's March directive forbidding nursing homes from preventing readmission of then infected COVID-19 positive patients didn't convince you he hates old people, maybe the 51 step process they take to get vaccines with millions of dollars in fines will convince you.\n\nVoices for Seniors, a group of grieving families that advocate for accountability, change and reform for our seniors, responded on Twitter:\n\nGovernor Cuomo and Dr. Zucker have made it clear: They feel our seniors are disposable. There's no other explanation for their continued and criminal mismanagement of everything COVID; from nursing home policies to vaccine distribution.\n\nAnd now, with so many lives to try to save, maybe the governor should spend some time truly leading.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBecause if the governor didn't learn this lesson in the spring, our most vulnerable need to be at the front of the line so that we can protect them and hopefully save their lives.\n\nAfter all the loved ones we lost, it's the least he can do for the ones who are still with us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JANICE DEAN
As the third day of the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump wrapped up in the Senate chamber, most of the drama was elsewhere -- with one witness for the Democrats accusing a Republican senator of defamation and slander after she questioned his patriotism and implicated him in a scheme to take down Trump from inside the White House.\n\nThe off-field spat began Thursday evening on Twitter, when Tennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn quoted the commanding officer of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as saying that Vindman was a political activist in uniform.\n\nVindman, a National Security Council official, testified during House Democrats' impeachment inquiry last year that Trump's Ukraine dealings left him in a state of shock, and Democrats were quoting from Vindman's remarks during the Senate trial on Thursday. Vindman has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower who flagged Trump's fateful July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president -- a claim that Republicans have questioned, because under cross-examination, Vindman apparently admitted to leaking the contents of Trump's call to the whistleblower.\n\nAt the time, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, presiding over the House impeachment inquiry, shut down GOP attempts to press Vindman as to whom he had leaked information about Trump's call, saying it would potentially reveal the whistleblower's identity.\n\nBlackburn tweeted as Schiff spoke on Thursday evening: Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy? ... Alexander Vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the President's July 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' Over a policy dispute with the President! How is that not vindictive?\n\nSCHIFF, IN MAJOR REVERSAL, ADMITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS OWN CONTACT WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nIt makes sense that Alexander Vindman leaked the July 25th phone call to his friend (aka the 'whistleblower'), Blackburn continued. They both have lots in common: —Held the same NSC job —Liberals who worked under Obama —Wanted to take out Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, has openly recruited potential informants from within the intelligence community since 2017, when he declared that a coup has started against Trump and predicted that impeachment would follow. Zaid also attempted to solicit prominent actors to raise awareness to his efforts to oust Trump, which began years before Trump's call with Ukraine's leader that ultimately led to his impeachment. Zaid has further acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with a prominent 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, but has not commented on specifics.\n\nVindman's legal team fired back within hours.\n\nThis difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose, David Pressman, a lawyer with Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP representing Alexander Vindman, said in a statement obtained by Fox News. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country. He believes in our country. And he believes in our country's great institutions, including the United States Senate.\n\nINGRAHAM INVESTIGATION: MORE TO UNCOVER CONCERNING BIDENS, BURISMA\n\nPressman added: That a member of the Senate – at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility – would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\n\nSpeaking to The Ingraham Angle late Thursday, Blackburn doubled down, saying that she has spoken to many members of the military who have a problem with the way Vindman circumvented the chain of command to try to undermine Trump's foreign policy.\n\nWe honor the service of every man and woman in uniform, Blackburn told anchor Laura Ingraham. You look at what his commanders said. He has a problem with his judgment. That's been pointed out. He had one commander who said he is a political activist in uniform. He has had problems with going outside of his chain of command, which is what he did here.\n\nI talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, Blackburn went on. They have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. What we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. We want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.\n\n'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY PROMISED IN 2017 TWEETS\n\nAt one point during his impeachment testimony last year, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with the NSC's Tim Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.\n\nMorrison further testified he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.\n\nMeanwhile, it remained unclear whether Vindman -- or any other witnesses -- would appear at the Senate trial, with Trump attorney Jay Sekulow telling reporters he didn't expect Democrats would present a compelling enough case to justify that step, but that it was still too early to discuss the issue.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ADMONISHES BOTH SIDES, AS FIRST DAY OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL ERUPTS INTO SHOUTING MATCH AFTER MIDNIGHT\n\nOn the whole, senators generally seemed somewhat more alert on Thursday, the third full day of the ongoing Senate impeachment trial and the second full day of the Democrats' opening arguments in the case.\n\nIt was a long day, Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a key moderate swing vote, told Fox News as the day wrapped on Thursday. I was one pooped puppy.\n\nShe said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. On Wednesday, Murkowski said she was offended when Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed Democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nOn his way out of the Senate on Thursday, though, Nadler said he was confident.\n\nI think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, Nadler told Fox News. The evidence is overwhelming. The president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. And as I said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say. It won't be refutations of the evidence; there won't be any new evidence, there will just be criticisms of the House managers, of our procedures, all irrelevant to the charges against the president.\n\nFrom the Senate gallery on Thursday, senators could be seen sitting in their seats for longer periods and intently taking what appeared to be more detailed notes than they were the previous two days. Multiple senators told Fox News they believe that's because senators are more rested today after the session on Tuesday drifted into Wednesday, before adjourning at 1:50 a.m. ET.\n\nThe day brought few new arguments, as Democrats focused primarily on the abuse of power impeachment article instead of the obstruction of Congress charge. Democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden did anything improper in dealings with Ukraine, and that President Trump sought a political investigation of Biden by Ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.\n\nThere was no basis for the investigation the president was pursuing and pushing. None. He was doing it only for his own political benefit, said Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas.\n\nSimilarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by Trump and his allies that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Although Democrats -- and some news outlets, including The Associated Press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of Ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a Ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the U.S. election. Additionally, a 2017 investigative report by Politico found extensive efforts by Ukrainians to hurt Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nIMPEACHMENT BACKFIRE? KEY MODERATE REPUBLICAN SAYS NADLER'S AGGRESSIVE REMARKS HAVE 'OFFENDED' SENATE\n\nTrump put himself first, ahead of U.S. policy and the national interest, Schiff, acting as Democrats' lead prosecutor, told the Senate.\n\nAdded New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: The decision to grant or withhold an Oval Office meeting with [Ukrainian] President Zelensky had serious security concerns for both Ukraine and the United States.\n\nYesterday, Trump and even some left-of-center commentators mocked Schiff for suggesting that Trump must be removed by the Senate because the 2020 election is already compromised. Schiff also implied Russia might invade the United States.\n\nOn Thursday, during his closing remarks, Schiff changed the argument somewhat. Invoking Vindman's statement that here, right matters, Schiff said that Trump needed to be removed because he was dangerous and trusted his personal attorney over the intelligence community.\n\nAdditionally, Schiff said Trump could not be trusted in the event that Russian hackers hypothetically attempted to publicize internal documents related to potential Biden corruption.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats were laughing along as Schiff joked that Trump had made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin,'' a reference to a comment by Putin last November: Thank God,'' he told an economic forum in Moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.\n\nI was one pooped puppy. — Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski\n\nThe theory that blames Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, Schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges. Trump is accused of seeking the Ukraine investigation — and a probe of Joe Biden and his son Hunter — for his own political benefit while holding back congressionally approved military aid as leverage.\n\nSCHIFF WARNS RUSSIANS COULD INVADE THE U.S., SAYS 2020 ELECTION IS COMPROMISED SO SENATORS NEED TO REMOVE TRUMP NOW\n\nThe White House and some congressional Republicans have raised questions about Hunter Biden's lucrative job on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, and Joe Biden's successful efforts to force the firing of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor. Biden was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president while Hunter made big money in Ukraine, and Hunter got the job after testing positive for cocaine in the Navy Reserves.\n\nDuring the House impeachment proceedings, a career State Department employee testified that he had flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest at the time but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vowed that Hunter's actions would soon play a large role in the trial.\n\nI know a lot about the Trump family and their dealings in Russia, Graham said. I don't know anything about the Biden connection. You're going to hear more about that.\n\nAs senators sat through endless hours of arguments on impeachment, they found a new outlet to focus their attention: fidget spinners.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., handed out the toys to his colleagues before Thursday's trial proceedings began. A fidget spinner is a small toy designed to be spun between the fingers, relieving stress or boredom.\n\nINSIDE THE CHAMBER, RESTLESS LAWMAKERS STRUGGLE TO PAY ATTENTION AS SENATE TRIAL DRAGS ON\n\nBurr was seen playing with a blue spinner while listening to arguments by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., an impeachment manager.\n\nOther senators, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., were also seen with spinners on their desks.\n\nWhile senators are pledged to silence during the trial proceedings — and deprived of their phones and other electronics — they are speaking out during breaks in the action.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, rebutted Republican senators who lamented they heard nothing new from House prosecutors. Republicans voted nine times this week to block the Democrats' proposed amendments for new witnesses and documents.\n\nIf they want new stuff, there is plenty of it,'' Schumer said at a news conference before Thursday's session. As the [impeachment] managers made clear, a lot of the documents are sitting there, all compiled, all ready to go, with simply a vote of four Republicans to subpoena them.''\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats are expected to wrap up their arguments when the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. ET Friday, with Trump's legal team set to make its case for up to three days beginning Saturday. Sekulow deflected rumors that the defense may wrap up in a single day.\n\nWe're going to use a sufficient amount of time to defend our case and point out the inconsistencies of their case. We're not going to run out the clock,'' he said. I am confident that whether it is [completed] Saturday or Monday or Tuesday that the case will be made defending the president. I have no doubt.''\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Marisa Schultz, Caroline McKee, Mike Emanuel, Thomas Firth, Andrew O'Reilly, Jason Donner, and Adam Shaw contributed to this report, as well as The Associated Press.
Cap-and-trade energy tax legislation appears stalled, at least for now, in the U.S. Senate. But that doesn't mean the cap-and-trade energy tax isn't imminent.\n\nSenate Environment Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer hasn't even introduced the bill yet; new Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln has declared the House bill dead on arrival; and there are several other cross-cutting controversies that divide Democrats on the bill. The Obama administration is unfazed. They are moving full steam ahead with an even more costly regulatory scheme in the name of global warming�shoehorning the regulation of greenhouse gases into the 1970 Clean Air Act, a bill passed before anyone had ever thought of global warming and that couldn't be less suited to the task.\n\nDriving the push for this massive power grab and circumvention of the elected branches is a key White House official who avoided Senate confirmation by being installed not as EPA director, but instead as White House Climate Czar: Carol Browner.\n\nLong before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.\n\nMary Nichols, the chair of the California Air Resources Board, has confirmed that Browner was the lead White House negotiator in establishing new automobile emissions standards, which for the first time rely on EPA's presumed authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Nichols told The New York Times that Browner quietly orchestrated private discussions from the White House with auto industry officials. We put nothing in writing, ever,� Nichols said.\n\nLeft unchecked, Browner will move beyond automobiles to EPA's entire staggering 18,000-page blueprint for regulating the U.S. economy. It will eventually regulate everything that moves (light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, motorcycles, planes, trains, ships, boats, tractors, mining equipment, RVs, lawn mowers, fork lifts, and just about every other piece of equipment that has a motor) and lots of things that don't (any building over 100,000 square feet could be pulled in, along with smaller carbon dioxide emitters, like restaurants, schools, and hospitals that have commercial kitchens with gas burners).\n\nIt's bad enough that the EPA is moving ahead with plans to pursue expensive global warming regulations instead of leaving the complex issue to Congress, the branch of government constitutionally tasked with making laws. It's made much worse by the fact that the effort is being led not by Lisa Jackson, the duly confirmed and therefore accountable administrator of the EPA, but by Carol Browner, the unaccountable, unconfirmed White House Climate Czar.\n\nBrowner was made a czar so that her powers could be more sweeping than they would be in any single official appointment�witness her cross-agency role in the secret automobile emissions regulations�and to avoid the scrutiny of Senate confirmation, which would have been difficult for Browner. Since leaving the Clinton administration she has moved further left, even becoming one of the 14 members of the Socialist International Commission for a Sustainable World Society� on whose Web site she was listed as a member as recently as January 5, the day she was named White House Climate Czar.\n\n\n\nThis Commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis. It's far outside the political mainstream and would have presented serious problems for centrist Democrats facing a confirmation vote.\n\nIt's one thing for President Obama to surround himself with the advisers he'd like to have, but it's another to bestow on them sweeping powers to broker secret negotiations and push forward vast new regulations that could cost American families thousands of dollars.\n\nFortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the U.S. Senate stand on allowing Carol Browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana has introduced an amendment (SA 2440) to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for Browner's policy directives. Any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just Carol Browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.\n\nMr. Kerpen is director of policy for Americans for Prosperity.

President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, says the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.\n\nBolton, who is in Israel to reassure the U.S. ally of the Trump-ordered withdrawal, says there is no timetable for the pull-out of American forces in northeastern Syria, but insists it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nBolton said on Sunday that the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nHis comments mark the first public confirmation the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.
Leaders, officials and critics from America's adversaries are taking aim at the U.S. on Thursday following the shocking scenes that unfolded on Capitol Hill, calling them everything from a beautiful sight to a fragmented democracy.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani offered a scathing response to the deadly violence sparked by the pro-Trump mob, saying in a speech on state television that what we saw in the United States yesterday evening and today shows above all how fragile and vulnerable Western democracy is, according to the AFP.\n\nA populist has arrived and he has led his country to disaster over these past four years, Rouhani added.

But do you remember what they said about Hong Kong rioters?\n\nPHOTOS: CHAOS ERUPTS ON CAPITOL HILL\n\nAs you said, they called it a 'beautiful sight to behold', beautifying the city's rioters as 'heroes of democracy' and claiming that Americans would stand with them, she added.\n\nIn June 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had called pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong a beautiful sight to behold and said Chinese President Xi Jinping has been really taking China backward in terms of repression, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Global Times newspaper, taking its own dig at Pelosi, wrote in a tweet that it remains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the recent developments in Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Communist Youth League also wrote next to a photo montage on the social media website Weibo that on the sixth, the U.S. Congress, a most beautiful sight to behold, the Associated Press reports.\n\nFBI SEEKING HELP FROM PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY THOSE IN CAPITOL BREACH\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry on Thursday commented that the events in Washington show that the U.S. electoral process is archaic, does not meet modern standards and is prone to violations, according to a statement The Moscow Times says was published by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nWe wish that the friendly American people will survive this dramatic moment in their own history with dignity, that statement added.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, on her Facebook page, shared a post that read in part the United States will never again be able to tell the world that we are the paragon of democracy.\n\nCommunist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov also argued that the unrest was payback for past American foreign policy decisions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe boomerang came back to them.

Disappointing! Sick! Outrageous! Pro-Trump protesters inside the U.S. Capitol must stand down at once!\n\nIt's hard to express my shock and sadness at seeing America's legislative palace breached, a door to the U.S. House broken, and senators and House members hunkering down, apparently in gas masks. Most astonishing is to see those involved in this violence not waving Antifa flags but, instead, Trump and MAGA banners.\n\nIt's only Jan. 6, but the 2021 Nobel Prizes for Unforced Errors and a Suicidal Leap from the Moral High Ground go to the pro-Trump protesters marauding through the halls of The People's House.\n\nGOP POLITICIANS CONDEMN VIOLENCE AT CAPITOL, CALL FOR AN END TO RIOTS\n\nIt would be bad enough if the acts of terrorism now being perpetrated by this mob were underway while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., banged her gavel and shut down any objections to Electoral College votes that many of my fellow Trump fans believe are tainted by ballot irregularities.\n\nOn the contrary, 180 degrees, the House and Senate were debating Republican objections to Arizona's Electoral College votes. Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas, was making his case to his colleagues, with his usual eloquence.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., head of the Freedom Caucus, rose to state his concerns about his own state's Electoral College votes. He even presented something that should not have existed: A stack of voter registrations that were recorded after the Grand Canyon State's statutory deadline. This is precisely the sort of evidence that the president's supporters have wanted for weeks to be aired in public.\n\nThus, the sheer mind-blowing stupidity of the buffoons who stormed the Capitol. They attacked Congress exactly as it was doing precisely what these people wanted done. This would be akin to Antifa breaking through the windows of the Capitol just as a Democratic U.S. Senate voted on final passage of Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all legislation.\n\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!\n\nWith guns drawn on the U.S. House floor (!), and reports of one person shot, this is the most vicious breach of the Capitol since the British Army attacked in 1814, during one of the most ominous moments of the War of 1812.\n\nIn an astonishing act of self-sabotage, these idiots now have made it enormously difficult for those of us who admire President Trump for his enormous domestic and international policy victories.\n\nInstead, any discussion of the highest median household income in American history, the lowest poverty rate ever, the complete liquidation of ISIS, and two COVID-19 vaccines in nine months will be answered with, Oh, you mean the boob whose people assaulted the U.S. Capitol?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThese un-American anarchists have performed an enormous disservice to President Trump, the America First movement, the more than 74 million voters who cast our ballots for him in November, and our beloved United States of America.\n\nThose intruders in the Capitol need to back off, evacuate, go home, and ponder the evil that they did.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Capitol Police and District of Columbia Metropolitan Police should arrest everyone who is in violation of local and federal laws.

It's official. By executive fiat, President Obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.\n\nHow did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?\n\nIf Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nConsider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.\n\nWell, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.\n\nPresident Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.\n\nThere is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.\n\nBut the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.\n\nNow, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.\n\nRecently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. After the laughter died down, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama an upside-down Pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.\n\nThe president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:\n\n1. Distorting Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nPresident Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.\n\nIn past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.\n\nBy contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.\n\nIt is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.\n\nHowever, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.\n\n2. Usurping Legislative Authority\n\nOur Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.\n\nYet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.\n\n3. Breaching His Sworn Duty\n\nPresident Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.\n\nIf President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?\n\nMen like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.\n\nAnd they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.\n\nIn the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. They held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. Even Lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the Civil War were grounded in the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nBut, like the title of his autobiography, Mr. Obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. It is no more evident than now.
A CNN panel of so-called Never Trump Republicans degenerated into a shouting match Monday night over their former loyalties and the use of the term identity politics.\n\nIn the course of fewer than three minutes, Ana Navarro ripped into Anthony Scaramucci for pointing out millions of Americans are displeased with identity politics, Amanda Carpenter mocked Scaramucci's brief tenure as President Trump's White House communications director, and Scaramucci accused Carpenter of working for a full-on traitor, referring to her tenure as an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.\n\nWith left-wing CNN host Don Lemon moderating, Navarro went on a rant after Scaramucci noted that more than 74 million Americans had voted for Trump, a fact he said demonstrated a flaw in the system.\n\nIt's identity politics and it's economics, Scaramucci said.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKS MARCO RUBIO'S FAITH: 'MR. BIBLE BOY' HAS 'BIBLE QUOTE FOR EVERY MOMENT'\n\nAnthony, I've got to tell you, there is no phrase I hate more than identity politics, Navarro snapped. When Republicans talk about identity politics, they're talking about people like me and people like Don. They're talking about our gender. They're talking about sexuality. They're talking about our skin color and our ethnicity.\n\nStrangely, Navarro then wondered whether voters who frame their electoral choices around politicians' views on guns or abortion are also practicing identity politics. Identity politics, however, generally refers to those who make voting choices based on unchangeable features, such as race, sex, or orientation, rather than policy issues.\n\nLemon tried to end the segment, but Navarro continued to fume, calling it a stupid phrase meant to trigger and a dog whistle.\n\nYou're too smart for that, Navarro said.\n\n'BELEAGUERED' WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS POSE FOR NEW YORK MAGAZINE PHOTOSHOOT\n\nWell, he worked for Trump, so I don't know, Carpenter chimed in, as Lemon laughed.\n\nAn offended Scaramucci shot back, You worked for Ted Cruz, a full-on traitor. I mean, what are you talking about? You don't have any standing to say that.\n\nExcuse me? Excuse me, Anthony Scaramucci, Carpenter said, affronted. I remember you going to the cameras and praising Donald Trump to the hilt. When I worked for Ted Cruz -- you want to go there? -- he took principled, constitutional stands.\n\nGet lost, she added.\n\nDon't be a hypocrite on national TV, Scaramucci said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLemon finally wrapped up the segment, but clearly, feelings had been hurt.\n\nFox News contributor Mollie Hemingway called the display an idiotic rodeo of hatred. Or a hateful rodeo of idiocy. Or both.
Longtime lawmaker Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said he'd never seen Vice President Pence as angry as he was when President Trump pressured him to decertify and return the results of the presidential election back to the states.\n\nTrump on Wednesday slammed Pence, saying he didn't have the courage to do so.\n\nI've known Mike Pence forever, Inhofe told Tulsa World.

If you do nothing else when planning your vacation, please compare airfares instead of going to one or two airline sites; it's the easiest and most reliable way to save on tickets.\n\nBut you can save lots more by keeping this in mind: Summer isn't the only season for travel. I know because I analyzed millions of flight combinations to find cheapest average days to fly; I then took what I learned and put it a handy, seasonal vacation planner.\n\nWinter\n\nSince Jan. 3, flights are generally at bargain prices — and it'll stay that way through early March when weekend fares start to rise. January and February are also cheap periods for trips to Europe.\n\nTip: Tickets are cheap now, but you still have to buy them in advance, from about two weeks to a month before takeoff for domestic travel, and a little longer for Europe. If you shop for tickets now to fly in the next day or so, you'll pay the steep prices business travelers are charged.\n\nUNITED AIRLINES CHANGING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT POLICY, BANNING YOUNG PUPPIES, KITTENS\n\nSpring\n\nThe latter part of March will see weekend tickets costing about 30 percent more than Tuesday/Wednesday flights. Weekend fares rise even more in April, and May fares overall are getting higher, especially toward the end of the month. For European travel, try to fly by May 21 — the last day before the more expensive, pre-summer prices kick in.\n\nTip: Spring is cheaper than summer, so if you can fly before June, do so.\n\nSummer\n\nFor U.S. flights, June 13 is the start of higher pre-summer fares, and peak season prices begin June 23. These high prices will generally remain in effect for U.S. travel through July. For Europe travel, the highest prices will be charged for flights in late June; fares actually drop a bit for July.\n\nTip: Fares drop for fall travel in the U.S. starting Aug. 20; Europe prices are expected to drop soon afterward.\n\nLOVE LETTER WRITTEN ON AIRLINE 'BARF BAG' GOES VIRAL\n\nFall\n\nUnfortunately, we can't get specific about autumn dates because airlines don't actively manage prices beyond nine months out. Yes, some airlines will sell you tickets for travel after this point, but such tickets tend to be mid-range prices and not the best deals. Here is some general guidance to help you map out fall travel plans.\n\nFly: In the U.S., September, October and especially early November are very cheap; early December is a bargain travel period, too. Europe flights are generally cheap from late September to mid-December.\n\nIn the U.S., September, October and especially early November are very cheap; early December is a bargain travel period, too. Europe flights are generally cheap from late September to mid-December.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders went after a female House Republican's critique of socialism on Friday by holding her responsible for the actions of her famed father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, a move largely decried as sexist.\n\nThe accusations came on the heels of the Vermont senator's excuse that he was a little bit busy when sexual misconduct allegations among his staff could have been addressed during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., drew the fury of the Democratic socialist, whom many consider a likely presidential candidate in 2020, after her speech Thursday in which she promised to fight against the the fraud of socialism that the new Democratic majority in the House will push this session of Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked 'the fraud of socialism,' Sanders wrote in a tweet. Really? I wasn't aware that it was 'socialism' that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started.\n\nThe senator's tweet referred to the vice president's now-debunked statement at the onset of the Iraq War in 2003 that Saddam Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut Sanders' attack raised some eyebrows for associating the female lawmaker entirely with the failures of her father instead of responding to her actual critique.\n\nLiberals: lol there are like NO conservative women in Congress, wrote Lyndsey Fifield on Twitter. Also liberals: hey there's a conservative woman in Congress... let's infantilize her by identifying her as the kid of a more important man and then hold her accountable for his policies.\n\nBlatantly sexist criticism here. Why should a female Republican have to answer for her father's actions? asked one Twitter user.\n\nI don't like this tactic of associating female politicians with their male familial ties rather than their policies, wrote another user. We all unwittingly forward patriarchy but Bernie's sexism is pretty hard to excuse at this point.\n\nCheney reiterated her attack on socialist ideas, mocking the senator's attempt to draw the attention to her father. Yes, @SenSanders, son of Eli Sanders, socialism is a fraud, she wrote.\n\nIt steals power from the people & gives it to the government, crushes human freedom & initiative & devastates economies (ask the Venezuelans). BTW - Your Dick Cheney history is as defective as your economic policy, she added.\n\nSanders is currently reeling from accusations that his campaign was pervaded by a predatory culture of sexual harassment and sexism, according to the New York Times.\n\nAsked by CNN's Anderson Cooper this week whether he was unaware of the accusations, Sanders sarcastically replied: Uh, yes. I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case. He then appeared to smile.\n\nOne former Sanders delegate said the campaign was rocked by entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with.\n\nThe report also revealed numerous complaints that women on the campaign were paid less than men and were frequently forced into inappropriate and uncomfortable situations.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this story.
Tech giant Apple may ban Parler – a platform founded to promote free speech that has a large user base of Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists – from its app store, which could be related to how it handled the rioting on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nSean Davis, a co-founder for conservative outlet The Federalist, wrote on Twitter that Apple is asking Parler to engage in censorship policies or face delisting, citing two people familiar with the situation.\n\nMultiple outlets reported earlier this week that both Apple and Google were under pressure to remove the app, which did not take down posts threatening violence against elected officials – including Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTWITTER PERMANENTLY SUSPENDS FLYNN, SIDNEY POWELL, SAYS THEY ENGAGED IN 'HARMFUL ACTIVITY' RELATED TO QANON\n\nSpokespersons for Apple and Parler did not return Fox News' requests for comment.\n\nParler, which was founded in 2018, was built upon a foundation of respect for privacy and personal data, free speech, free markets, and ethical, transparent corporate policy.\n\nSome conservatives – like Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky. – began turning to the platform this year after becoming frustrated with content moderation on the major platforms.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth Facebook and Twitter locked Trump's account this week. While his Facebook page is expected to remain locked through President-Elect Joe Biden's inauguration, his Twitter feed was suspended on Friday night.\n\nMajor social media companies have come under increasing pressure – and scrutiny – for policing content on their websites, including adding fact-check labels to certain posts.\n\nSome Democrats believe the companies need to do more to monitor content posted by users. Former First Lady Michelle Obama, for example, put out a statement following the raid on Capitol Hill this week saying that Silicon Valley needed to do more to prevent this type of monstrous behavior.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have alleged that social media companies engage in their content moderation policies with an anti-conservative bias.
As a consumer of political content, I'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and TV segments analyzing the importance of the Georgia Senate run-off elections on Tuesday. Control of the Senate means, in no uncertain terms, that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to bring their agenda to life… or not.\n\nIt was central to both Biden's primary and general election campaigns that he was the candidate best suited to be able to work with Republicans and I believe that's very much the case.\n\nHe has decades long relationships with key GOP officials, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and has shown throughout his career that he is very effective at reaching across the aisle to work on bipartisan legislation.\n\nBut for all of Biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that Republicans have no interest in working with him. Biden can make all the overtures he wants, McConnell has been clear. He sees Democrats as the enemy.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE: GOP SENATE CANDIDATES IN GEORGIA ARE TRUMP PUPPETS WHO ACT LIKE CONTESTANTS ON 'THE APPRENTICE'\n\nIt follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.\n\nIt's underrated and often forgotten just how sick Americans are of the inaction in Washington. Congress enjoys an approval rating in the low teens on a good day and voters overwhelmingly believe representatives are more concerned with themselves and playing politics than what's best for Americans.\n\nNeed evidence? Look no further than the drama over the COVID-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of Americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the GOP still blocked it. They can't even work together with Democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.\n\nThere will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Joe Ossoff are in D.C., that will be possible. If Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue win on Tuesday, McConnell will block that desperately needed assistance.\n\nThis is about so much more than COVID assistance, though. If Democrats hold a Senate majority, Biden should be able to make progress on key issues like the economy, health care, immigration and climate change.\n\nThese are policy areas where there is broad agreement amongst Americans.\n\nNearly two thirds of Americans favor increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That includes 77% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans. And over two thirds support an increase in the federal minimum wage. While a majority of Republicans don't support a $15 minimum wage, there is broad support for a raise beyond the current rate of $7.25.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act currently enjoys a 53% favorability rating as compared to just 34% who oppose it in the latest Kaiser Family Foundation polling. Nearly 75% believe that it's important that people with pre-existing conditions remain protected.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn immigration, Americans broadly support legal status for DACA kids. Recent polling shows 75% hold this position. They also believe immigrants are good for the country, this includes a majority of Republicans, and bring with them a strong work ethic and talent.\n\nAnd on climate change, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change. They also want the government to go further to reduce greenhouse gases, restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese aren't Democratic positions, they are American positions. But only one party will ensure they come to life: the Democrats. These are all positions and policies Biden will be able to tackle if Democrats also control the senate.\n\nA win for Warnock and Ossoff is a win for American priorities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JESSICA TARLOV

She joins with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in urging Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump from office immediately, calling him 'a very dangerous person' who committed an 'act of sedition.' Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol. 'I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and cabinet do not, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.' 'The President of the United States incited an insurrection against America,' Pelosi added.\n\n\n\nTransportation secretary to resign in protest - USA Today: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes. 'Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,' Chao said in a statement. 'As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.' Chao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.\n\n\n\nPence furious - Tulsa [Okla.] World: [U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe] hedged on who he thought might be to blame for what happened [Wednesday], but he allowed that Trump did not do enough to stop it. … Instead, Trump directed his disdain toward Vice President Mike Pence… By doing so, he may have alienated one of his most steadfast allies. 'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).'' Aside from Wednesday's attempted takeover of the Capitol, the past few days have been difficult for Inhofe because he refused to go along with protesting the Electoral College results. 'We've had calls. We've had threats. … I have many very, very close friends mad at me, when all I'm doing is upholding my oath,' Inhofe said.\n\n\n\nKinzinger backs removal - Fox News: GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against President Trump following a harrowing day at the nation's Capitol. 'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'\n\n\n\nBarr: Trump committed 'betrayal of his office' - Politico: Former Attorney General William Barr accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of a 'betrayal of his office' — the latest rebuke of the president by a former high-ranking administration official after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. 'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.' Barr's criticism on Thursday was not his first public comment on the chaos at the Capitol. As the president's supporters breached the building on Wednesday afternoon, he released a statement through his spokesperson that did not refer to Trump by name. 'The violence at the Capitol Building is outrageous and despicable,' Barr said on Wednesday. 'Federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it.'\n\n\n\nTop officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'\n\n\n\nTrump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: RAYS OF GLORY FROM THE GLOOM\n\nIf now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: IT MUST HAVE BEEN MOONGLOW\n\nThe Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nGOT A WILD PITCH?

Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'\n\n\n\nBiden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.\n\n\n\nBiden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Raimondo was elected as the first female governor of Rhode Island in 2014. Before that, she served as the state's general treasurer. She also led the Democratic Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. Before she entered public service, Ms. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture-capital firm. Ms. Guzman was a senior official at the SBA during the Obama administration, serving as deputy chief of staff. In 2019, she became the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nCotton condemns tactics used by Cruz, Hawley - The Hill\n\n\n\nThe complete list of lawmakers who backed Trump bid to steal election - NYT\n\n\n\nHoyer announces no sessions of the House until after the inauguration - Fox News\n\n\n\nPence chief of staff says Trump locked him out of White House - NY Post\n\n\n\nThe Judge's Ruling: COVID restrictions violate our natural rights to personal liberty - Fox News\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: 'GETTING IN TUNE TO THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW'\n\nThe rule of law is not just some lawyer's turn of phrase. It is the essence of our democracy. – Merrick Garland in a speech after President-elect Joe Biden introduced him as his attorney general pick on Thursday, per The Atlantic.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\nI was just sitting here wishing I could get Stirewalt's take on today's events, lamenting that there would probably be no Halftime Report today. Then this showed up in my inbox. We love you, Chris -- thank you. … I had held a cynical take on all this election fraud nonsense (that it was to raise money, or pressure states to rollback their vote-by-mail programs, or both). But I struggle to reconcile that take with the call with Brad Raffensperger. I do worry that Trump has now spent 8 weeks drinking his own Kool-Aid. – Shawn A. Van Ness, Browns Point, Wash.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: As much as I wanted to just melt into a puddle after staying up all night for the Georgia runoffs and then a day spent watching the riot, I knew I needed to be with you lovely people. You did me more good than I did you, I promise.]\n\n\n\nI agree with every carefully chosen word you wrote [Wednesday] about the attack on our Capitol, our country and [the Republican] Party. I am, as Mitt Romney once claimed to be 'severely conservative.' There is no time for whatboutism or 'Antifa is bad too' today. I'm without words to say more. Maybe you can keep writing for all of us. – Brian D. Liddicoat, Watsonville, Calif.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Antifa most certainly is bad. So is social isolation. So is the decline of the nation's spiritual health. So is the rise of negative partisanship. So is the dearth of local news coverage. There's so much that is bad in American public life these days. But what really saddens me are those who pretend Wednesday's ransacking was inevitable. Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless. What a sad betrayal of the sacrifices made to provide the extraordinary opportunities we now enjoy. The doom caucus helped lead us here.

In a news conference Thursday night, newly-elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22. Even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, Pelosi called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it. We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi told reporters.\n\nEarlier Thursday, President Trump made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi on once again becoming House speaker and to stand by his repeated calls to fund a border wall. At the president's request, Pelosi and other congressional leaders are scheduled to return to the White House on Friday morning to resume talks to end the shutdown.\n\nA WARNING TO PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMS: Republican strategist Colin Reed says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats should not celebrate too long. They are about to be reminded that governing is a lot more difficult than making campaign promises - and Democrats are far from being united ... In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Reed writes: House Democrats are about to find out that governing is harder than campaigning. Their majority is paved through 31 districts won by Trump in 2016 that flipped blue in 2018, many of which had resided in the GOP column for generations.\n\nThese red districts are not fertile political ground for the deep blue policies pushed by progressives, Reed continues. Furthermore, many of these new members of Congress explicitly pledged to oppose Pelosi in order convinces voters of their electability – pledges that are about to be put to the test. Already, the intra-party Democratic fault lines are evident.\n\nANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ... Arkin, a U.S. Army veteran who has worked for NBC as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus, Arkin wrote. - Reported by Joseph A.

Alachua County Fire Rescue reported that flames ignited after 50 gallons of diesel fuel spilled on the highway. Emergency crews extinguished the fire and said they were treating the crash as a homicide investigation, but did not say why. The fire was so intense that authorities said it damaged parts of the road.

PAMPLONA, Colombia – A little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. It's the only thing she has to call her own.\n\nBoys nearby play soccer with an empty soda bottle. Men, reduced to tears, hide away in makeshift tents, counting pennies to feed their families.\n\nIt first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News. People don't leave their children behind because they want to. It is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in Venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.\n\nThe depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just Latin America - with little end in sight. It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nYou have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. Combine all these aspects together, and Venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.\n\nResponse for Venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.\n\nNeighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from Venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.\n\nIn most towns and cities across Latin America, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from Venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.\n\nAnd for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable Venezuelans. Officials refer to those leaving Venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.\n\nAlthough more than 3.3 million Venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in Ecuador – have applied for asylum.\n\nMany just can't feed their children so their focus is on just getting a job, anything until they can go home again, explained UNHCR's Representative in Ecuador, María Clara Martín. I have rarely seen a Venezuelan who says they don't want to return.\n\nOther professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various NGO and UN bodies are endeavoring to address.\n\nSantiago Chavez, Ecuador's Vice Minister of Mobility, said there are more than 300,000 Venezuelans currently living in Ecuador, with about three-quarters having entered in an irregular – otherwise illegal – way.\n\nThe effort that Ecuador is having to do here is proportional to Germany allowing a million Syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as Germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, Chavez said. Ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.\n\nJobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.\n\nWhile fleeing to another nation provides some hope, most resort to street selling.\n\nAt the Resting House in Quito, Ecuador a group of 20-something former students and professionals take turns selling cookies in different parts of the street.\n\nI've only been able to send money home to Venezuela on two occasions, lamented Yondel Alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. My wife is in Colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in Venezuela. My other children are with my mother in Venezuela and I have to stay in Ecuador to try to work.\n\nThe impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.\n\nIt's really rough what the migrants have gone through. Everyone is frustrated, depressed, said Marcelo Viteli, the General Manager of the Resting House where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.\n\nINSIDE LATIN AMERICAN 'AMAZING RACE' STAR'S DRAMATIC ESCAPE FROM VENEZUELA\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION WALKING BACK OBAMA-ERA FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES IN BURMA\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that Colombians were fleeing en masse to Venezuela – then the richest nation in Latin America, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. While the tables have abruptly turned, most Colombians are eager to return the generosity.\n\nAn array of Colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.\n\nAt one small hut near the border town of Cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the Samaritan's Purse donation mound.\n\nFurther along the winding road, Colombian local Marta Duque – who opened the home to help Venezuelans after feeling a deep sense of sadness for what they were enduring – say she, too, has been threatened with fines and being arrested, given the hazard of having scores of migrants pouring out into the streets.\n\nBut she refuses to give up and shut down. I have to help because I understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, Duque said.\n\nOne young mother, Marisela, cradles her young son on Duque's floor, and encourages him to take deep breaths.\n\nHe is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in Venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. Life there is chaotic in every sense. I hope to get him medicine in Colombia. But without government change, there is no going home.\n\nThe acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large. The country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across Latin America.\n\nThe migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. Ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty Venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in May this year. A second wave hit in October, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.\n\nPeople who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. Now they have absolutely nothing, said Victor Bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in Colombia. In just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. Sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. Something must be done. The humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.\n\nBoth government and non-governmental professionals tending to the regional calamity concurred that this year there has been a profile shift in those fleeing.\n\nIn the first few years of the meltdown, which gained momentum in 2015, those with some finances and education were able to buy plane tickets out. But as the situation has slowly deteriorated, those from poorer backgrounds started to escape.\n\nOne U.S government official closely monitoring the case told Fox News that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.\n\nExperts surmise that at least one in 10 leaving Venezuela now are disabled, and have pointed to an uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing international borders – mostly boys between the ages of 15 and 17. But many don't have documentation.\n\nUltimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.\n\nBut with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward Venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.\n\nWe are trying to establish programs that can be of benefit to both Ecuadorians and Venezuelans, and address the welfare concerns of both, said the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Ecuador's Chief of Mission, Manuel Hoff.\n\nIn several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the Venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.\n\nYet the end game is unclear. All signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after January 10, when Maduro begins another presidential term. Though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.\n\nSo Maduro will after Jan. 9 be deemed illegitimate in the eyes of most international players – including the United States – which has been mulling designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism alongside Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.\n\nYet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.\n\nThe Maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the US- and US-supported political foe for waging economic war.\n\nOver the past fiscal year, the United States has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the Department of State and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional Venezuela contingency. In September, the U.S. pledged a further $48 million. Moreover, the Department of Defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.\n\nThe number of Venezuelans fleeing is expected to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, according to the United Nations, in what has become the largest exodus in modern Latin American history.\n\nThe U.N High Commissioner for Refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.\n\nIt is forecasted that Colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected Peru will have 1.4 million Venezuelans by the end of 2019. Ecuador, Brazil, as well as other countries in the Southern Cone, Central America and the Caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in Venezuelan arrivals.\n\nThe UN is projecting that at least two million more Venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.\n\nNonetheless, Chapman, the American Ambassador in Ecuador, underscored the U.S is committed to the cause, and said the Trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.\n\nWhat has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important.
Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.\n\nAlthough planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.\n\nThree Republicans supported the Democrats' rules, including Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York Reps. John Katko and Tom Reed. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and California Rep. Ro Khanna voted against the rules package.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\n\nThe pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a tweet Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nWe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. But, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.\n\nPay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.\n\nThe rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.\n\nAnd, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. That means the rules will still preclude Democratic Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the House floor -- but Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.\n\nAdditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.\n\nPortions of the rules had also provided that the House has the authority to defend ObamaCare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.\n\nDEM INTRODUCING IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES AGAINST TRUMP ON FIRST DAY OF NEW CONGRESS\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats Thursday night debated a combined spending bill to end part of the government shutdown.\n\nThe House late Thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. But the bill does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.\n\nAnother piece of legislation proposed and debated by Democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.\n\nIn a news conference Thursday night, Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22 amid demands from the White House that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.\n\nHowever, Pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.\n\nWe sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.\n\nTrump met with Pelosi and other senior Democrats at a contentious meeting on Wednesday in the White House Situation Room, which included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen within five seconds, according to Republicans at the meeting. The sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new Congress was seated Thursday.\n\nThe message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.\n\nWATCH: TRUMP HOLDS SURPRISE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BORDER PATROL UNION\n\nShortly after Pelosi's historic return to the House speakership, Trump made his first-ever appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.\n\nTogether with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.\n\nI promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.\n\nTrump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional Democrats. In a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on Capitol Hill, Pelosi on Thursday evening formally invited Trump to deliver State of the Union speech in Congress on Jan. 29.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.
China believes President-elect Joe Biden represents a new window of hope for the country's relationship with the United States, according to state media.\n\nBiden's critics have expressed concern that he will take a friendlier stance toward China than President Trump as tensions between the two rivals have risen after a trade battle and the spread of COVID-19.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told state media outlet CGTN last week that a new window of hope is opening with the incoming administration.\n\nThe Biden administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation, Wang said.\n\nBIDEN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER ATTACKED TRUMP IN INTERVIEW WITH CHINESE STATE-RUN MEDIA\n\nHe added that the U.S. and China have run into unprecedented difficulties in the past few years, and some American politicians see China as the United States' so-called biggest threat, leading them to base China policy on serious misconceptions.\n\nSuch a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail, Wang said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nU.S.-China tensions have escalated under the Trump administration due to a yearslong trade war between the two countries amid U.S. accusations of intellectual property theft, cyberattacks, fentanyl exports to the U.S. and other crimes; criticism related to the coronavirus pandemic; and China's human rights record with regard to Muslim minority populations in its northeast region and Hong Kong.\n\nTrump has implemented strict sanctions on China since taking office and blacklisted dozens of Chinese companies accused of facilitating human rights abuses against the country's Uighur population.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IN 2017 SENT 'BEST WISHES' FROM 'ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY' TO CHINA FIRM CHAIRMAN, REQUESTED $10M WIRE\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping in November congratulated Biden on winning the 2020 election, according to state media outlet Xinhua.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday sent a message to Joe Biden to congratulate him on election as U.S. president, Xinhua reported without adding further detail.\n\nBiden is expected to review the Trump administration's China tariffs once the president-elect takes office, according to The Wall Street Journal, though he has said he would not immediately remove tariffs.
Japan on Friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland China rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.\n\nFollowing an online uproar over the government's treatment of Dr. Li Wenliang, 34, the ruling Communist Party said it was sending an investigation team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nTwo docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan.\n\nBefore Friday's 41 confirmed cases, 20 infected passengers were escorted off the Diamond Princess at Yokohama near Tokyo. About 3,700 people have been confined aboard the ship.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday that Japan will deny entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship — Holland America's cruise ship Westerdam, on its way to Okinawa from Hong Kong — because of suspected virus patients found on board. The Seattle-based operator denied anyone had virus.\n\nCHINA'S CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK KILLS 638, INFECTS MORE THAN 31,400 AS WORLD STRUGGLES FOR A CURE\n\nAbe said the new immigration policy takes effect Friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into Japan.\n\nThe ship with more than 2,000 people was currently near Ishigaki, one of Okinawa's outer islands, and was seeking another port, said Overseas Travel Agency official Mie Matsubara.\n\nEveryone is starting to reject the ship and we are getting desperate, she said. We hope we can go somewhere so that passengers can land.\n\nAt least four other cruise ships, two foreign and two Japanese-operated, are headed to Japan by the end of the month, Transport Minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said, urging port authorities around the country to turn them away.\n\nDr. Li had worked at a hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. He was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others when the government did not, writing on his Twitter-like Weibo account that on Dec. 3 he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak that the government initially tried to cover-up.\n\nTRUMP SPEAKS TO CHINA'S XI ON PHONE ABOUT CORONAVIRUS AND TRADE\n\nLi wrote that after he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he was visited on Jan. 3 by police, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to having spread falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued.\n\nA copy of the statement signed by Li and posted online accused him of making false statements and seriously disturbing social order.\n\nThis is a type of illegal behavior! the statement said.\n\nLi wrote that he developed a cough on Jan. 10, fever on Jan. 11 and was hospitalized on Jan. 12, after which he began having trouble breathing.\n\nHe also wrote that he had not in fact had his medical license revoked, a reference to the sort of extrajudicial retaliation the communist authorities meet out to rights lawyers and others seen as troublemakers.\n\nPlease rest easy, I will most certainly actively cooperate with the treatment and seek to obtain an early discharge! Li wrote on Jan. 31. He posted again on Feb. 1, saying he had been confirmed as having the virus.\n\nOn Friday, the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper and usual staunch defender of the authorities, reported that many said the experience of the eight 'whistleblowers' was evidence of local authorities' incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus.\n\nIt quoted Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as telling the paper's editor that we should highly praise the eight Wuhan residents.\n\nThey were wise before the outbreak, Zeng was quoted as saying. The paper also cited online voices saying local authorities owe Li an apology. It quoted one posting as saying, We lost a hero. If his warning could send an alarm, the outbreak might not have continued to worsen, the posting said.\n\nLooking back, his professional sense of vigilance in particular is worthy of our respect, the paper said in an editorial.\n\nThe police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation's highest court. We have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors, a posting on the court's Weibo account said.\n\nMeanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. Doctors said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.\n\nChina's state media said Friday that President Xi Jinping urged the U.S. to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with President Donald Trump.\n\nA people's war against the virus has been launched, Xi was quoted as saying by broadcaster CCTV, using timeworn communist terminology. We hope the U.S. side can assess the epidemic in a calm manner and adopt and adjust its response measures in a reasonable way.\n\nBeijing has complained that the U.S. was flying its citizens out of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China.\n\nThe White House said Trump expressed confidence in China's strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the outbreak.\n\nWuhan has built two new prefabricated hospitals in recent weeks and is adapting gymnasiums, exhibition centers and other spaces for patients were milder symptoms.

Democratic leaders are doubling down on accusations that President Trump's description of a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is manufactured, as the president prepares to visit the front-lines on the heels of his Oval Office address to the nation.\n\nThe response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.\n\nTrump plans to meet with congressional leaders once again in the Situation Room Wednesday afternoon, ahead of his planned trip to the southern Texas border on Thursday. But past meetings have resulted in both sides digging in, with Trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democrats saying they won't entertain the discussion until Congress passes and Trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies.\n\nTuesday night's primetime address saw both camps drifting even further apart, with Trump declaring a humanitarian and security crisis and vowing to protect America, so help me God – and Democratic congressional leaders saying Trump is working to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\n\nDEMS ACCUSE TRUMP OF 'MALICE' AFTER BORDER SPEECH\n\nSpeaking Wednesday on Fox News' America's Newsroom, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language.\n\nThis whole border security crisis … it really, I believe, is a manufactured crisis, he said, adding that it's distracting from issues like health care and education.\n\nThe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat; they are a humanitarian challenge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the joint Democratic rebuttal alongside Schumer.\n\nTrump and his allies say Democrats, many of whom supported border security measures in the past, are only bucking the calls now because of knee-jerk opposition to his administration.\n\nBut Perez maintained that Democrats believe in meaningful border security, and also believe a wall is not smart policy.\n\nTRUMP DECLARES CRISIS AT BORDER\n\nHow the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. The mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on Congress and the White House to forge a deal in the coming days.\n\nYet Trump told congressional leaders the standoff could last months, even years, as he demands Washington take action to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and criminals crossing the border.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump underscored cases of Americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was murdered the day after Christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. The suspect had multiple prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that California's sanctuary laws -- which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities -- led to Singh's murder.\n\nAmerica's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border, Trump said. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\n\nHe asked, How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi responded: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.

A U.S. judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration's most sweeping set of asylum restrictions less than two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\n\nThe rules had been set to take effect Monday. The court order has limited immediate impact because the government has largely suspended asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border during the coronavirus pandemic, citing public health concerns.\n\nStill, letting the rules take effect would have been felt by some who can still claim asylum and make it significantly more difficult for all asylum-seekers once pandemic-related measures are lifted.\n\nPresident Trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.\n\nTRUMP EXTENDS RESTRICTIONS ON WORK VISAS, SAYS PANDEMIC STILL DISRUPTS 'AMERICAN LIVELIHOODS'\n\nThey sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. The restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the U.S.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco sided with advocacy groups who sued, saying acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf lacked authority to impose the sweeping rules.\n\nDonato, who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by President Barack Obama, wrote that Wolf's appointment violated an established order of succession. He said it was the fifth time a court has ruled against Homeland Security on the same grounds.\n\nThe government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, Donato wrote. This is a troubling litigation strategy. In effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.\n\nMEXICO SEEKS HELP TO GET COVID-19 VACCINES FOR MIGRANTS IN US\n\nDonato said his ruling applies nationwide because limiting its reach would result in a fragmented and disjointed patchwork of immigration policy.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would make an emergency appeal. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.\n\nAaron Frankel, an attorney for plaintiffs, has called the rules nothing less than an attempt to end the asylum system.\n\nAsylum is a legal protection designed for people fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership to a social group. Any foreigner who steps on U.S. soil has a legal right to apply for asylum, according to U.S. asylum law and international treaty obligations.\n\nThe rules would narrow the types of persecution and severity of threats for which asylum is granted. Applicants seeking protections on the basis of gender or those who claim they were targeted by gangs, rogue government officials or non-state organizations would likely not be eligible for asylum.\n\nImmigration judges would be directed to be more selective about granting asylum claims and allow them to deny most applications without a court hearing.\n\nAS BORDER NUMBERS INCREASE, CBP CHIEF SAYS US FACES 'FULL-BLOWN CRISIS' IF TRUMP-ERA POLICIES END\n\nThey also would have weighed several new factors against an applicant's ability to win protections, among them failure to pay taxes. Criminal records would still count against an asylum-seeker even if their convictions were expunged.\n\nUnder pandemic-related measures in effect since March, about nine in every 10 people stopped at the border are immediately expelled on public health grounds. The rest are processed under immigration laws, which include the right to seek asylum.\n\nDonato took issue with how people came to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf became acting secretary in November 2019, replacing Kevin McAleenan, who was also in an acting role. Courts have ruled that Wolf improperly leapfrogged to the top job from his position as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans.\n\nDonato, like other judges, said McAleenan, who had been Customs and Border Protection commissioner, also was promoted to the top Homeland Security job out of order, making his handover to Wolf have no legal effect whatsoever.\n\nHomeland Security has been without a Senate-confirmed secretary since Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019.\n\nWhile the Trump administration faced a legal setback, it's already instituted a raft of policies restricting asylum, including making asylum-seekers wait in Mexico while their claims are heard in U.S. court.\n\nBiden is expected to reverse some of Trump's restrictive asylum measures, including the Remain in Mexico policy, but recently said his administration would need probably the next six months to re-create a system that can process asylum-seekers to prevent a flood of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlso Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled against the administration's policy that gave state and local governments the right to refuse to resettle refugees.\n\nThe three-judge panel said Trump's executive order that required both state and local entities to give their consent before allowing refugees to be placed in their areas would undermine the 1980 Refugee Act. That law set by Congress was designed to allow resettlement agencies to find the best place for a person to thrive while working with local and state officials.
RIZWAN TABASSUM via Getty Images Pakistani military cadets march on the birth anniversary of the country's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah at his mausoleum in Karachi on December 25, 2016.\n\nISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan fired its first submarine-launched cruise missile on Monday, the military said, a show of force for a country that sees its missile development as a deterrent against arch-foe India.\n\nThe launch of the nuclear-capable Babur-3 missile, which has a range of 450 km (280 miles) and was fired from an undisclosed location in the Indian Ocean, is likely to heighten long-running tension between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. Both nations have been developing missiles of varying ranges since they conducted nuclear tests in May 1998.\n\nPakistan eyes this hallmark development as a step towards reinforcing the policy of credible minimum deterrence, the military's media wing said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman at the Indian defense ministry was not immediately available to comment on the Pakistani missile test.\n\nIndia successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable, submarine-launched missile in 2008 and tested a submarine-launched cruise missile in 2013.\n\nThe Pakistani military said the Babur-3 missile was capable of delivering various types of payloads and will provide Pakistan with a Credible Second Strike Capability, augmenting deterrence.\n\nAn army spokesman later confirmed the language meant the missile was equipped to carry nuclear warheads.\n\nThe Babur-3 is a sea-based variant of the ground-launched Babur-2 missile, which was tested in December. The military said the missile had features such as underwater controlled propulsion and advanced guidance and navigation.\n\nLast year, Pakistan said it was seriously concerned by India's test of anti-ballistic missiles which media reports said could intercept incoming nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to media reports, on May 15 India tested a locally designed Anti-Ballistic Missile system which could in theory intercept a nuclear-carrying ballistic missile.
Zach Gibson via Getty Images Mat Staver (far right), the founder of Liberty Counsel, at a demonstration outside the Supreme Court on Dec. 12, 2018. After backlash against his opposition to an anti-lynching bill, the group claimed that listing protected categories in the legislation would limit its application.\n\nAfter more than a century of inaction from Congress, the Senate unanimously approved legislation in December that would make lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nBut some conservative evangelical Christian activists are upset that the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act contains language that specifically protects people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nMat Staver, the founder of the conservative litigation group Liberty Counsel, told the Christian news site OneNewsNow that his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the act is stripped of this inclusive language.\n\nThe old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in, he said in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nWhile emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, Staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer Americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.\n\nThis is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has spent years advocating against LGBTQ rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative Christians over the civil rights of queer Americans. The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Staver (left) at a news conference discussing a trial on same-sex marriages in San Francisco in 2006. In a recent interview he said his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the anti-lynching bill is stripped of language protecting LGBT people.\n\nOn its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isn't about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.\n\nSince a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\n\nAs of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nStaver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nPizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.\n\nLambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.\n\nBecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal — and whether or not we should be equal — we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear, Pizer told HuffPost in an email.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mike Huckabee (left), Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and Staver, her lawyer, after her release from jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky. Liberty Counsel has for years advocated against LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn response to backlash it received for Staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, Liberty Counsel released a statement Thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the OneNewsNow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would limit the law's application.\n\nLynching should be prohibited no matter the person's reason for committing this violent crime, Staver said in the statement.\n\nThe organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.\n\nIn a YouTube video defending the organization, Jonathan Alexandre, Liberty Counsel's public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching's horrible history to push unrelated political agendas. He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the created list of protected categories.\n\nThe historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class.\n\nPizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an ends-justify-the-means approach to furthering its goals.\n\nWith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. That it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become.
Last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a Michigan courtroom to describe how Larry Nassar altered their lives with his abuse. They were heard and heeded. The judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. Many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. And their abuse, it seems, counts for little.\n\nA staggering number of incarcerated women are victims of childhood sexual abuse. Studies suggest that between 47 and 82 percent of women have endured that crime. Other studies say 94 percent of incarcerated women have been victimized sexually, some as children, others as adults.\n\nBecause women have long been lumped in with male prisoners in correctional and prosecutorial planning for years, it's only recently that researchers culled data that show what's really happening to incarcerated women. Last year, the Prison Policy Initiative painted the first landscape of female incarceration. What they found was disturbing.\n\nJail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: Sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. The remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. In 2016, the Vera Institute of Justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.\n\nThe United States has made a practice of locking up victims.\n\nIn other words, the United States has made a practice of locking up victims. The blame for that practice can be laid at the feet of the burgeoning opioid crisis; the war on drugs, which has a disparate effect on women; and our widespread insistence on ignoring girls when they report sexual abuse.\n\nThe Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. Victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. Childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. Women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. Between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.\n\nDuring roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). Women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. Eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.\n\nWomen in state prisons are more likely to be incarcerated for a drug or property offense (like theft) than men are. According to The Sentencing Project, 24 percent of women in state facilities have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 15 percent of male prisoners. When it comes to property crimes, 28 percent of incarcerated women have been convicted, compared to 19 percent among incarcerated men.\n\nThe failed war on drugs has targeted women at the very moment that illegal drugs are more widely available to women who are seeking relief from profound suffering.\n\nWe have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. Unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. Introduced last summer by Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and co-sponsored by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.\n\nThe Dignity Act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. Even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the Dignity Act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. While the Dignity Act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.\n\nAn even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. This means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. In addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.\n\nMany people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. But the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as Nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. One way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the Nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.\n\nOur sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. But it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. It disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. All victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.\n\nChandra Bozelko is the author of Up the River: An Anthology and writes the award-winning blog Prison Diaries.

Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images The Manhattan skyline glowing with electric power, as seen from the Long Island City side of the Queensboro Bridge.\n\nASTORIA, N.Y. ― A top New York City councilman is preparing to introduce a bill mandating that the city come up with a plan by the end of the year to phase out nearly two dozen gas-fired power plants and replace them with renewable sources of electricity.\n\nThe legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft HuffPost obtained. By Dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.\n\nThere's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. But the impact could be huge. Of the 24 power plants in New York City, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. The other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.\n\nReached by phone on Monday, Councilman Costa Constantinides, the Queens lawmaker who authored the bill, confirmed its existence but declined to comment on its details.\n\nDonald Trump may love power plants, but we know the 21st-century future is a green grid, said Constantinides, who chairs the council's Committee on Environmental Protection.\n\nThe bill, announced Tuesday and set to be introduced Wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. Six cities across the United States already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. The city council in Washington, D.C., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. But it would be a historic first for a metropolis like New York to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.\n\nSome small cities have managed to shift to renewable electricity but nothing on the scale of New York, said David Pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute, which tracks the utility sector.\n\nIt's unclear whether an overhaul of New York's power stations would trigger utility cost increases for ratepayers, but industry groups likely to oppose the bill are expected to argue that it would.\n\nThe legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. That would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the New York waterfront. Those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.\n\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost Councilman Costa Constantinides announced a bill to reduce emissions from big buildings at a City Hall press conference last year.\n\nBut a large share of New York City's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of Queens that Constantinides represents. The plants, located in the councilman's native Astoria and neighboring Long Island City, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. The stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. The Long Island City plant, called Ravenswood Generating Station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.\n\nThe bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a Consolidated Edison substation next door to the Astoria Generating Station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. The accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.\n\nBut the incident ― on which Constantinides is scheduled to hold a Feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference outside a utility complex in Astoria on Tuesday morning, Constantinides said, It's time for a greener future here in western Queens.\n\nAstoria Borealis was a spotlight on the issues of what we're dealing with in our community, he said.\n\nIn 2015, Astoria and Long Island City suffered from higher pollution levels than the rest of the borough and the city, according to New York City Department of Health findings. The levels of PM2.5 ― a fine-grain pollutant that wedges into lung tissue when inhaled, making it one of the most harmful types of particulate matter ― hit 8.9 micrograms per cubic meter, higher than the 8.4 average for Queens overall and the 8.6 average citywide.\n\nQueens officials, including Constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern Astoria the nickname Asthma Alley. In 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using No. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and No. 4 oil by 2030. The new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images An electric arc released by an equipment malfunction at a ConEdison substation in Astoria illuminated the New York skyline late last month.\n\nMeanwhile in Albany, the new Democratic majorities in both houses of the New York Legislature are preparing to push the Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. The CCPA has repeatedly passed in the state Assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous Republican majority in the state Senate refused to hold a vote on it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.\n\nNew York state generates just 5 percent of its electricity from wind or solar. The New York City area consumes roughly 60 percent of all power in the state, but produces just 40 percent.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a newly elected legislator from Queens, vowed to co-sponsor the CCPA and consider other ways to provide state-level support to Constantinides' legislation.\n\nWe're looking into what can be done as a state measure as we speak, she told HuffPost on Monday. It's exactly what we should be doing.\n\nState agencies are already making a push. Last June, New York's Department of Public Service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. In December, the state's Public Service Commission released a plan requiring utilities such as ConEdison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although Politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.\n\nPete Sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots group New York Communities for Change, said it's critical for the city to conduct its own study to put more pressure on state agencies.\n\nIt's all about politics, Sikora said after Tuesday's press conference. And it's important that it's in the city's hands.\n\nThe power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from Constantinides in a little over five weeks. In November, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. That would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the Green New Deal for New York City.\n\nThe legislative push builds on high-profile efforts from other top City Hall officials. In December, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer announced a significant next step in divesting the city's $200 billion pension funds from the oil and gas sector as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city's fossil fuel risks.\n\nLast January, Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to sue five major oil companies over infrastructure damage linked to sea level rise. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July, but California and seven other states signed on to New York City's appeal in November.\n\nPomerantz, of the Energy and Policy Institute, suggested that the deadline in the power plant bill is key.\n\nThe question of speed makes all the difference in the world for climate change, he said. If New York City is serious about its climate goals, that's exactly what it needs to do, is look at the question and say, 'How quickly can we get out of gas and into renewables?'\n\nThis story was updated with details from the press conference and comment from Pete Sikora.
In the midst of a partial government shutdown that has left thousands of federal employees without pay, top Trump administration officials ― including Vice President Mike Pence ― may be cashing in on substantial salary raises.\n\nThe raises, first reported by The Washington Post, could go into effect as early as Saturday and amount to as much as $10,000 per eligible official.\n\nSalaries for hundreds of top government executives have been frozen since 2013, when Congress enacted a pay freeze amid debate surrounding the fiscal cliff bill.\n\nThe pay freeze lapsed last month after lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on spending bills for multiple federal agencies. Unless legislators take action by Saturday, the Post reported, the freeze is likely to expire and government executives like Pence could begin receiving raises that would have accumulated due to annual cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nThe raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as Republicans in November were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told lawmakers in August he wanted to scrap the annual pay raise for civilian federal employees, arguing the nation's budget couldn't finance it.\n\nFederal workers were poised to receive a 2.1 percent pay increase in January, along with an annual locality pay increase.\n\nWe must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases, Trump wrote in a letter to House and Senate leaders.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Some federal employees, such as Transportation Security Administration workers, have had to work without pay during the government shutdown.\n\nTrump in late December went forward on the pay freeze for federal workers, while the government shutdown was in effect.\n\nWith the pay cap lifted, Cabinet secretaries could be eligible for an annual salary bump from $199,700 to $210,700, the Post reported. Salaries for deputy secretaries could jump from $179,700 to $189,600. Pence's salary could rise from $230,700 to $243,500.\n\nThe raises could cost $300 million in taxpayer money over the course of 10 years, the Senior Executives Association told the Post.\n\nRoughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. Another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. Democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the House on Thursday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed to block the bill, and Trump said he would veto it.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills, said it was outrageous that top Trump administration officials could take home raises while other federal employees go without pay.\n\nAt a time when 800,000 federal employees aren't getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the Trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the Vice President and its political appointees, Lowey said in a comment to HuffPost.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), whose attempt to maintain the pay freeze for top government executives was voted down by House Republicans in June, condemned the potential raises.\n\nDonald Trump has a long history of shortchanging workers, McCollum said in a comment to HuffPost. While the government is shut down and federal employees are going without pay, he's doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. I find this outrageous. The president must rescind this action, or Congress must work to prohibit it.\n\nThe White House did not immediately offer comment on the potential raises. The government's Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump said during remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday he was considering not granting the raises to cabinet members.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the administration was aware of the issue and was exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.\n\nJacqueline Simon, the policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said no federal workers of any rank should be subjected to pay caps.\n\nWe think it is a good thing salaries for top executives and political appointees will no longer be frozen, but we would expect the administration to abide by the 'officers eat last' principle and make sure that rank and file federal employees receive a pay adjustment first, Simon said in a emailed comment to HuffPost.\n\nShe added: If pay freezes are wrong for those at the top, then surely they are wrong for those on the front lines, and we urge the President to make sure that everybody gets an adjustment so they can keep up with the cost of living.\n\nThis has been updated to include comment from McCollum and Sanders.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) is the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills. In fact, she chairs the committee.\n\nHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it. If you're willing to be interviewed, please provide a phone number.
Home purchasers who were obliged to take out private mortgage insurance (PMI) because their down payment was less than 20% of the price have the right to cancel it, ridding themselves of the monthly premium. Borrowers should take advantage of the opportunity if they can but they must meet the cancellation rules.\n\nCancellation Rules\n\nUnder Federal law, lenders are required to cancel private mortgage insurance on most home mortgage loans made after July 29, 1999. Cancellation will occur automatically when amortization has reduced the loan balance to 78% of the value of the property at the time the loan was made. The borrower cannot accelerate this process with extra payments.\n\nUnder another provision of this law, lenders must terminate insurance at the borrower's request when the loan balance hits 80% of the original value. Borrowers can accelerate the process of getting to 80% by making extra payments.\n\nWarning: A lender need not accept a request for cancellation if the borrower has taken out a second mortgage or had an excessive number of delinquencies in the prior two years, or if the property has declined in value.\n\nIf Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac own the mortgage, the cancellation rules apply to the current appraised value of the property rather than the value at the time the loan was made. Borrowers can request cancellation after two years if the loan balance is no more than 75% of current appraised value, and after 5 years if it is no more than 80%. The ratios are lower if there is a second mortgage, if the property is held for investment rather than occupancy, if the property is other than single-family, or if the borrower has had recent delinquencies.\n\nPaying Off PMI as an Investment\n\nHomeowners should view paying off PMI as a potential investment that can yield a high return. Until now, figuring out how large that return was exceeded the capacities of almost all borrowers, but no longer. My colleague Allan Redstone has developed a PMI payoff spreadsheet, which shows the investment required to eliminate PMI, and the rate of return on that investment, for each of three rules: 80% of original value, 75% of current value after 2 years, and 80% of current value after 5 years. The spreadsheet is on my web site and is available for anyone to download.\n\nA unique feature of PMI payoff as an investment is that the amount of the investment is a specific dollar amount. Hence, the borrower's decision must consider not only the rate of return but also whether or not they have the exact amount required.\n\nHere is an example. Three years ago, the borrower purchased a house for $200,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $190,000 at 4%, and a monthly mortgage insurance premium of $65. She expects to be in the house another 4 years. The house is now worth $225,000, requiring an investment of $11,098 to bring the loan balance down to $168,750, which is 75% of $225,000. The return on investment in dollars is the $65 a month insurance premium for 68 months, plus the $14,280 difference in the loan balance in month 84 when the owner expects to sell the house. The rate of return is 8.96%\n\nNote that the $65 monthly saving in mortgage insurance extends for only 68 months because in month 69, the ratio of loan balance to original property value falls below 78%, which under the law requires the lender to cancel the policy.\n\nBorrowers Paying Higher Premiums Earn a Higher Return\n\nThe example described above applied to a relatively low-risk transaction that carried a very modest mortgage insurance premium. The transaction assumed a single-family home, a purchase for occupancy, and a credit score of 800.\n\nBorrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. When they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. If the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. In that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.\n\nHow the Passage of Time Affects the Investment\n\nIntuitively, it would appear that the sooner you pay down the balance and rid yourself of the PMI premium, the better off you will be, but this may or may not be the case. It depends on the circumstances and preferences of the borrower.\n\nConsider the example given earlier where after three years the borrower earns 8.55% on an investment of $11,098. If the same borrower decided to make the investment after 4 years instead of 3, her dollar savings would be smaller because both the number of PMI premium payments and the balance reduction in the payoff month would be smaller. On the other hand, the required investment would be $7326 instead of $11,098, which might make it affordable, and the rate of return on investment would be 10.52% as compared to 8.55%.\n\nIn general, the longer the borrower waits to pay down the balance to the point where the PMI is eliminated, the smaller is the savings in dollars and in the investment required, but the higher is the rate of return on investment. The power of the spreadsheet is that it allows each individual borrower to adopt the payoff strategy that best fits her needs and capacities.\n\nComparison with Other Investments\n\nIn comparison to other investments, an investment in PMI payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. The drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is. Eliminating this uncertainty is the reason we developed the spreadsheet.\n\nFor more unbiased advice on mortgages, visit my website The Mortgage Professor.
A new pathogen that is believed to have originated in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China, late in December has spread to at least 15 countries including Canada, the U.S., France and Singapore.\n\nThe Wuhan virus is a new form of coronavirus — a term for a group of viruses that have crown-like spikes on them and cause illnesses as benign as the common cold and as severe as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis strain of coronavirus has infected more than 6,000 people globally and killed at least 132. In some people, it causes symptoms similar to the common cold — such as coughing and fever — but in more severe cases it gives patients pneumonia-like symptoms.\n\nCoronaviruses often spread between animals, but some make the jump from animal to human when they mutate, which appears to be the case here, according to Steven Hoffman, a professor of global health, law and political science at York University.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where a number of people related to the market fell ill with a virus, sits closed in China's central city of Wuhan on Tuesday.\n\nInitially, the disease wasn't readily transmitted from person to person and all patients had visited the market believed to be the source of the outbreak. But the virus appears to have mutated, giving it the ability to transmit more easily between people and having infected some health-care workers. However, all transmissions are still first and secondary. That means so far, people who got sick either went to the market or were in contact with someone who was at the market, which has been closed for disinfection since Jan. 1. No one has gotten it from third or fourth degree transmission, Hoffman said.\n\nViruses and other pathogens evolving is one of the challenges when it comes to managing and curing them, but it happens often.\n\nThe important thing to note is this isn't abnormal … this kind of development is exactly what the world has been preparing for because we know that these things are going to happen, Hoffman added.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS An employee works to prevent a new coronavirus at Suseo Station in Seoul on Friday.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include coughing, fever, difficulty breathing and lesions on the lungs that can be seen during medical imagery.\n\nResearchers and doctors are still searching for answers regarding this new coronavirus, including what animal passed it on to a human. Investigations into the disease's origins, range of effects and types of transmission are still in their beginning stages.\n\nIs Canada concerned?\n\nOn Jan. 25, health officials confirmed a man in his 50s who had travelled from Wuhan to Toronto had contracted the virus — the first reported case in Canada. Officials said the man was in stable condition in a negative pressure room at a Toronto hospital. A second case in Toronto — the first patient's wife — as well as a case in B.C. have now also been identified.\n\nDr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the province's health system acted as it should and the risk to Ontarians is still low.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada is monitoring the situation as it progresses but also said the risk to Canadian travellers and Canada is low. A spokeswoman from the agency said the country is well positioned to deal with the disease.\n\nWe have been preparing with the provinces and territories since we heard about the first cases in China. We began implementing new measures to mitigate the risk of introduction of the virus into Canada and to control and prevent its spread, said Maryse Durette, the agency's senior media relations advisor.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday file photo, a staff member moves bio-waste containers past the entrance of the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center in China.\n\nCanada's robust public health infrastructure means the country is prepared to deal with it, Hoffman noted.\n\n[The system] is ready to identify cases, diagnose them, isolate people if needed, and provide the full range of care for those who find themselves sick.\n\nHoffman said there's no need to panic. However, health agencies must be ready, which is why investing in public health even between outbreaks is so vital.\n\nThis is the new normal in the sense that we live in a globalized world where people are travelling and carrying pathogens and bacteria with them, which do not carry passports. So we just need to be prepared.\n\nFederal health agencies have already planned with their territorial and provincial counterparts on what actions to take if more cases start to appear in Canada.\n\nIf a case is identified, the ministry will convene several co-ordination and communication processes, including the clinical team treating the case to ensure they have the scientific and technical expertise and support that they need. We will also share communications with our broader health-system partners for their situational awareness, David Jensen, a spokesman for Ontario's Ministry of Health, said before the virus reached the province.\n\nThis map below from Johns Hopkins University shows the global spread of the new coronavirus. Story continues below.\n\nOther provinces are deploying similar measures.\n\nIn Alberta, we have proactively issued a province-wide advisory to doctors to ensure physicians are aware of the virus, are able to take recommended actions and promptly alert public health officials if they encounter a suspected case, Tom McMillan, a representative for Alberta Health, told HuffPost Canada.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer of Health is also working with Alberta Health Services to ensure that the health system is ready to respond effectively if needed, he added.\n\nHow can Canadians protect themselves?\n\nLike other coronavirus strains, the Wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. Experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.\n\nMasks might make you feel better, but they aren't particularly helpful, as most are more likely to protect the person wearing them from spreading the infection rather than catching it.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Passengers wear masks amidst an outbreak of a new coronavirus in a subway station in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nWhat now?\n\nA vaccine could take years of research and testing to develop. MERS, for example, which emerged in 2012 and has already killed 851 people, still doesn't have an approved inoculation. SARS, which was identified in 2002 and killed 774, mostly ran its course on its own by the end of 2003. Most people with various forms of coronavirus recover on their own, but older people and those with chronic disease are more likely to be hit with severe forms of the illness.\n\nBut Canada and other countries are more prepared to deal with this virus than they were in 2002 when SARS was active. Communication between nations is open, and the specific strain of coronavirus already has a diagnostic test available.\n\nWhat's most important is that we're monitoring, keeping up to date on what's happening, trying to learn as much as possible and sharing that information with everyone who needs that. What we're seeing is a lot of communication between the federal governments and provincial and territorial governments, as well as between Canada and other countries and the World Health Organization, Hoffman noted.\n\nThe first step of being prepared for a potential future pandemic is to have that information and have the mechanisms to share it.\n\nA Canadian travel advisory recommends travellers to China avoid high-risk areas that have animals such as farms, markets and butchers, avoid contact with living and dead animals, and avoid surfaces with animal waste on them. The advisory also reminded travellers to wash their hands frequently and monitor their own health carefully during and after their trips. Travel in and out of China was expected to increase around the Lunar New Year holiday on Saturday.\n\nChina has put at least 12 cities under lockdown, attempting to restrict the movements of around 35 million people. Hoffman said a quarantine on that scale is unprecedented and is unlikely to work, either in China or hypothetically in Canada.\n\nEven if we did try to stop travel, it still happens anyway. The good news about travel that's done through official channels like flights is that you can track it and if someone does get a case, you can use some contact tracing knowing who that person traveled with and who they were around, he said. Generally travel bans don't work and people find ways around them.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A health official scans the body temperature of a passenger as she arrives at the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Indonesia, on Wednesday.\n\nMany international airports across the globe, including ones in Canada and the U.S., are screening passengers for symptoms, though this approach didn't work very well during the SARS outbreak.\n\nIn theory, it allows you to narrow in on who might have this, but in practice in the past, that approach was not shown to be helpful during SARS, for example, there were cases where people were in Canadian airports. We did screen millions of people for temperatures and didn't find a single case of SARS. That way so very expensive, disruptive and doesn't always work.\n\nSince the virus has already been genetically sequenced, diagnosing new cases is a fairly quick process. The World Health Organization is monitoring the situation but has not yet declared a global health emergency because the spread outside of China is still contained.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press
President Donald Trump owns three golf resorts in the European countries he has spared from his travel ban.\n\nForeign nationals from all 26 countries of the Schengen Area, which make up most of Europe, will be barred from entering the U.S. for at least 30 days as protection against the spread of coronavirus, Trump announced Wednesday. The United Kingdom and Ireland are not part of that group, but they do have cases of coronavirus — and Trump golf resorts.\n\nThe president's Trump Organization owns a golf course in Doonbeg, Ireland, and two in Scotland: Trump Turnberry and Trump International Golf Links.\n\nTrump said Thursday that he exempted the U.K. from the travel ban because he believes conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is doing a good job battling coronavirus. But several health experts disagree with Trump's assessment.\n\nTrump's decision is clearly not based on science, Jeremy Konyndyk, a Center for Global Development fellow who helped the U.S. deal with the Ebola crisis, told Foreign Policy magazine.\n\nJohnson has been attacked for being slow to take action to stop the spread of the illness, such as shutting down large gatherings to head off widespread contagion.\n\nJohnson declared on Britain's This Morning TV program on Tuesday that one coronavirus theory is that people should take it on the chin and allow the disease to move through the population. But, he added, I think we need to strike a balance.\n\nRichard Horton, the editor in chief of the medical journal The Lancet, accused Johnson of playing roulette with the public by taking his time instituting changes.\n\nThe UK government—Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson—claim they are following the science. But that is not true. The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. The government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error. — richard horton (@richardhorton1) March 10, 2020\n\nIn a marked change of tone, however, similar to that exhibited by Trump, Johnson said Thursday that the virus threatens the worst health crisis in a generation and that many more people will die. But he wasn't quite prepared to stop major sporting events.\n\nThough Italy and France have far more cases of coronavirus, 590 cases were reported Thursday in Britain — a 30% jump from the previous day. The chief health officer of the U.K. believes as many as 10,000 people could already be infected.\n\nTen people have died of the illness there. Ireland reported its first death Wednesday and is canceling St. Patrick's Day celebrations this year.\n\nTrump's former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said that a ban on European travelers makes little sense now that the illness is already being passed within U.S. communities.\n\nThere's little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy. Earlier, yes. Now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful. We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe. We MUST focus on layered community mitigation measures-Now! — Thomas P. Bossert (@TomBossert) March 12, 2020\n\nThe irony is that if we don't implement aggressive community interventions and mitigate the spread of the virus already in the United States, we will end up infecting or reinfecting Europe. #coronavirus — Thomas P. Bossert (@TomBossert) March 12, 2020\n\nTrump blamed the European Union for exporting cases to the U.S., a strategy some critics said was intended to deflect criticism from his administration.\n\nAs president, Trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in Scotland and Ireland, which have struggled financially. He took an entourage to Doonbeg after a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II last year. Vice President Mike Pence went three hours out of his way to stay at Trump's resort in Doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to Ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in Dublin. The U.S. Air Force spent nearly $200,000 at Trump's Turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) once told a fellow left-wing activist that the Democratic Party was too intellectually bankrupt to allow the progressive movement to flourish within it.\n\nIn a 1985 letter newly obtained by HuffPost in which Sanders debated running for governor, he wrote: Whether I run for governor or not is really not important. What would be a tragedy, however, is for people with a radical vision to fall into the pathetic camp of the intellectually bankrupt Democratic Party.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nSanders, who has served as an independent in Congress — first in the House and now in the Senate — since 1991, is now among the leading Democratic candidates for president, second behind former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, and tied for first in Iowa. He's raised more money than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, with more individual contributions. His platform — which includes Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and wealth redistribution through aggressive taxes on the richest Americans — defines the party's progressive wing.\n\nHe has taken the Democratic Party's loyalty pledge and repeatedly promised to support whoever becomes the party nominee to defeat President Donald Trump. But that hasn't been enough for many of his critics in the party's establishment, who are likely to point to the letter as evidence he doesn't play nice with the party.\n\nAt the start of his career in politics, Sanders viewed the Democratic Party as hopeless. By 1985, he had already made several failed bids for elected office in Vermont as a member of the progressive Liberty Union party. He finally succeeded in 1981, becoming mayor of Burlington, the state's largest city, and toppling a five-term Democratic mayor.\n\nAt the beginning, the Democrats were very angry with him, Jane Sanders, Sanders' wife, said in an interview with HuffPost. Burlington's Board of Aldermen — a part-time, 13-seat city council — resisted Sanders' efforts. They wouldn't let him appoint any of the mayoral appointments. They stopped him from hiring the city attorney, city clerk, city treasure ... [The Democrats] were outright enemies in the beginning.\n\nSanders never won full control of city government, but he organized enough voters to elect some allies onto the board and win veto power. He soon became popular enough to win reelection by a 20-point margin.\n\nThe Sept. 5, 1985 letter ― which has not previously been reported on ― came as Sanders was considering a run for governor, and left-wing activists in the state and around the country were debating whether he should mount an independent bid or launch a primary challenge to the state's Democratic governor, Madeleine Kunin.\n\nObtained by HuffPost A Sept. 5, 1985, letter from then-Burlington, Vermont, Mayor Bernie Sanders to Marty Jezer, a progressive activist.\n\nSanders' three-paragraph missive was addressed to Marty Jezer, an author and progressive activist in the state. Then-Mayor Sanders was writing in response to an August letter from Jezer in which he apologized that a memo he wrote to Sanders had leaked to the press. While the exact contents of the memo are unclear, Jezer's letter indicates that it encouraged Sanders to run for Congress instead of challenging Kunin.\n\n1986 is the wrong time for such a race, Jezer, who died in 2005, wrote. I hope you will listen to the voices of the committed activists around the state. We sink or swim with this together.\n\nSanders ultimately reached a different conclusion: He ran against Kunin as an independent. But the decision was not without dissent. An editorial from the socialist magazine In These Times criticized Sanders for dividing the left.\n\nIn choosing to create a three-way race, Sanders is dividing the left and making more likely the defeat of an incumbent liberal woman governor by a more conservative Republican, In These Times wrote. (At the time, Kunin was one of only two female governors in the country.)\n\nThe editorial prompted Sanders to reply: I believe that the real changes that are needed in this country … are not going to be brought about by working within the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.\n\nKunin eventually won reelection with 47% of the vote. Republican Peter Smith finished second, earning 38% of the vote, while Sanders finished third with just 14%.\n\nThe Vermont senator's critiques of the Democratic Party are well documented, as CNN reported last July. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he was adamant that a progressive movement could not be built within the party and was highly critical of the moderate New Democrats who argued that the party's progressivism in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s had alienated voters.\n\nI think that nationally, the party has on issue after issue sold out so many times that if you go before the people and say, 'Hey, I'm a Democrat,' you don't usually generate a lot of enthusiasm, Sanders said in 1991 about the idea of a progressive trying to work within the party.\n\nCommenting on civil rights activist Jesse Jackson's Democratic presidential runs in the 1980s, Sanders said he did not agree with Jackson's decision to work within the Democratic Party. (Sanders endorsed Jackson's candidacy.) His skepticism of the party continued in subsequent decades. In 2011, he said Democrats could be called Republican-lite for considering cuts to Social Security and Medicare in order to lessen the deficit. And his first presidential campaign in 2016 didn't shy away from blasting the party apparatus.\n\nSanders' willingness to criticize the Democratic Party speaks to the progressive bona fides highlighted by his supporters. His campaign often relies on decades-old videos of Sanders warning against the Iraq war, multinational trade deals and the climate crisis using the same rhetoric he still uses today.\n\nBut the senator's view of the party — and the role of progressive politics within it — has evolved. He's since refined his critiques to focus on the corporate wing of the Democratic Party, which is composed of the same centrists, including organizations like Third Way, that pushed the party to the right during the 1980s and '90s.\n\nJane Sanders, who did not recall the exact circumstances of her husband's letter to Jezer, said this shift came about when he was elected to the House as an independent. He knew that if Democrats didn't let him into their caucus, he wouldn't be assigned to any committees and would be left out of the process altogether.\n\nHe believed that the two-party system was bankrupt, but as he was put in a position by the people of Vermont to effect real change, he had to consider, how do you effect real change? Jane Sanders said. His concern isn't party politics.\n\nBy 2015, when he launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders had fully changed his mind about the ability for progressive politics to flourish within the party.\n\nThe decision that I made, as the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress, I said, 'If we are going to win this race, we have to do it within the Democratic primary process,' Sanders said in a 2016 interview with NBC's Chuck Todd. He decided to not run as an independent because he didn't want to be a spoiler in the presidential race.\n\nBernie fights when he has to fight, Jane Sanders said. Bernie's interest is getting things he wants done, done. He found that he had to fight effectively against the Democratic Party at the beginning as mayor. But over time, by organizing, he learned he can change the Democratic Party.\n\nSanders' relationship with the party has notably softened since that first presidential run. He served on the Senate Democrats' leadership team and his 2016 campaign managed to push the Democratic National Committee to change rules around superdelegates, lessening the power of party insiders in the nominating process.\n\nThat hasn't been enough for many of his critics, who accuse him of only half-heartedly campaigning for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 after dragging out the primary, and question whether he would be willing to support down-ballot Democratic candidates who don't share his progressive ideology.\n\nJane Sanders said she hadn't spoken with her husband about how he would engage in party politics should he be elected president. But she was explicit about how he approaches it currently.\n\nIf you organize, the people will elect new people, Jane Sanders said, citing those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who famously ousted a top-ranking House Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections. You will see Bernie supporting and raising money for the best of the Democrats. You will not see him doing that for others.\n\nBut former Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 nominating contest, said he was skeptical that Sanders could keep the party together during an election against Trump.\n\nThe notion that [Sanders] would lead the national Democratic Party would be repugnant to both Democrats and to Bernie Sanders, because he's not a Democrat, Shumlin told HuffPost in a phone interview. He'd be the first one to tell you that.\n\nThat the party's policy debates have only now caught up to him was Sanders' opening pitch to voters when he announced in early 2019 that he would run for president again.\n\nOver the last two years — and before — you and I and millions of Americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society, and we've had some successes, Sanders said when launching his 2020 bid.\n\nAs one of the top contenders going into the Iowa caucuses in early February, Sanders now clearly believes that he can bring about a progressive revolution within the Democratic Party — one that he's worked to change.
Video credit: Skye Fitzgerald, director, Spin Film\n\nAhmed Elhubbish, a middle-aged Yemeni living in Yemen's capital city of Sanaa, wants to know what his children — Abdul Rahman, Khalid, Wasim and Siham — did wrong.\n\nLast year, they were killed in an airstrike launched from thousands of miles above them by sophisticated machinery from continents away. What could make them targets for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the U.S. that has been bombing Yemen since 2015?\n\nThere's not a single reason for persistent attacks on Yemenis such as the May 2019 strike that hit his children, Elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from Hunger Ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in Yemen, which was directed by Oscar and Emmy nominee Skye Fitzgerald. (Watch above. Note: The video contains graphic images.)\n\nThe footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with HuffPost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by Elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.\n\nLawmakers, U.S. officials, humanitarian groups, anti-war activists, arms dealers, foreign representatives and others have debated the American role in Yemen for years in Washington ― though rarely with such vivid evidence of the policy's consequences as is documented in Fitzgerald's film.\n\nIt's vital now to have a clear picture of what President-elect Joe Biden's choices could mean for Yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change U.S. policy.\n\nThe country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when Iran-backed rebels known as Houthis ejected Yemen's internationally recognized government from Sanaa. Six months later, Saudi Arabia and its allies, notably the United Arab Emirates, launched a military intervention against the Houthis ― with crucial backing from the U.S. and other Western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.\n\nMost national security experts believe that without American support for the bombing, the Saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. That move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the Houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own Yemeni partners.\n\nThe war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the United Nations reported in December. Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group. The strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting State Department lawyers to worry that American involvement could implicate U.S. officials in war crimes.\n\nAfter nearly five years of fighting, the Houthis continue to control the most populated parts of Yemen ― and the Saudis continue to bomb those regions with U.S. support, most recently on New Year's Eve.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, Washington provided the Saudi-led coalition with aerial refueling that enabled it to run longer bombing campaigns, as well as intelligence and regular supplies of fresh bombs, while defending the campaign from international criticism and supporting a Saudi blockade of Yemeni ports that drove up food prices and pushed millions of Yemenis into famine-like conditions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued that policy and took further steps against the Houthis that had devastating consequences for Yemenis, such as slashing U.S. aid for Houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. When lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher U.S. approach to the Saudis over their role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of American aid to the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nTrump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.\n\nBiden has promised he will end the Obama-era policy and treat Saudi Arabia as a pariah. But he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: Biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that Trump crafted for the U.A.E. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional Democrats opposes.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, Scott Paul of Oxfam America told HuffPost in December after a slim Senate majority approved the U.A.E. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in Yemen. Congress and the Biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in Yemen.
By Erin El Issa\n\nThere are many personal finance tenets to follow when you decide to take control of your finances. Perhaps one of the most important is this: Don't pay fees unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe average cost of checking account fees over a decade totals almost $1,000, according to a recent study. But many of these fees -- including common ones such as maintenance, ATM and overdraft fees -- can be avoided by choosing the right bank and cultivating good banking habits.\n\nHere's what you should know about common bank fees and tips for avoiding them, including options for low-fee checking accounts that also earn interest.\n\n1. Maintenance fees\n\nMany traditional banks charge a maintenance, or service, fee on checking accounts -- about $10 to $12 per month.\n\nSome banks will waive the charge if you keep a daily minimum balance or have a certain amount of money deposited directly into your account each month. Others require a certain number of debit card transactions each month for the waiver.\n\nCheck your bank's policy for exact terms so that you can set up direct deposit and keep the minimum required balance to avoid maintenance fees. If you can't meet the requirements, look for a bank without these fees.\n\n2. ATM fees\n\nYou've probably had the experience of needing cash and looking unsuccessfully for an ATM affiliated with your bank. You ended up with no choice but to go, cringing, to another ATM, resigned to paying a fee to your bank and possibly another to the ATM's operator. Such fees average $2.01 and $2.75, respectively, according to the study.\n\nATM fees can be avoided by using your own bank ATM. That may require choosing a bank whose ATMs are easily accessible from your home or workplace, or looking for local bank branches and ATMs when you are out and about. You could also get cash back when making debit card purchases at many retail locations, eliminating the need for a trip to the ATM.\n\n3. Overdraft fees\n\nYour bank may charge you an overdraft fee if your withdrawals and transactions total more than the balance in your checking account. Most large U.S. banks charge at least $35 per overdraft, according to a recent Pew study. if you don't correct the negative balance in a certain amount of time, you could get hit with an extended overdraft fee -- that median is $20, the study said.\n\nConsumers average about two overdrafts per year. But these fees are avoidable. The obvious solution is to avoid spending more money than you have in your account. You can also choose to have your transactions declined by the bank if your funds are insufficient.\n\nIf you opted into your bank's overdraft program, which will carry a fee when you exceed your account balance, talk to customer service about opting out. Then keep a close eye on your bank balance, and use a credit card or cash to avoid overdraft fees.\n\nUse an online-only bank or credit union\n\nYou can optimize your finances more by using an online-only bank or credit union. Online financial institutions have fewer overhead costs than traditional banks, so they are typically able to offer free checking accounts with higher interest rates and no maintenance fees. They typically don't have their own ATMs but tend to be part of a network of fee-free ATMs that are widely accessible, especially in larger cities.\n\nIf you regularly have to deposit cash or like to visit a branch, try brick-and-mortar credit unions, which usually have lower fees and higher interest rates than big banks. Credit union membership may be restricted to residents of certain geographical areas or workers at qualified employers, but you may be able to join by making a donation of $5 to $10. That's generally less than one month's service fee at a big bank, so it's worth the investment.\n\nThis article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by U.S. News & World Report.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A U.S. judge in California on Sunday blocked Trump administration rules, which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nJudge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.\n\nBut Gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, rejecting their request that he block the rules nationwide.\n\nThe changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections. Some private employers could also object on moral grounds.\n\nCalifornia and the other states argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.\n\nThe law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents the rules protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.\n\nAt issue is a requirement under President Barack Obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. Obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. The Trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.\n\nAt a hearing on Friday, Gilliam said the changes would result in a substantial number of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a massive policy shift.\n\nThe judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules — a decision that was upheld in December by an appeals court.\n\nThe ruling affects California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A state panel on Monday banned the open carry of guns in Michigan's Capitol, a week after an armed mob rioted in the U.S. Capitol and following an attempt last year to storm the statehouse.\n\nMoves to ban weapons at the statehouse have been pushed since April, when protesters opposed to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions, some armed with long rifles and other weapons, entered the Michigan State Capitol demanding to be allowed into the legislative chambers. Some entered the Senate chambers.\n\nThe Michigan Capitol Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the Capitol, had been reluctant to issue rules for firearms, but it shifted course Monday and issued the order to ban open carrying of weapons.\n\nDemocratic legislators have pushed since April for a ban on open and concealed carry to avoid violence and continue to call for the policy to ban all firearms.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who previously said the commission shouldn't be responsible for creating weapons policies, said last week that he would support an open carry ban after violence erupted at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters.\n\nThe plan to take over the statehouse included an alleged a domestic terror plot to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, including taking hostages at the Capitol while they held a trial for the governor, the FBI and state law enforcement officials said.\n\nSen. Dayna Polehanki has pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the Capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session. The Livonia Democrat said Monday before the panel vote that an open carry ban does not go far enough and will lead to a false sense of security for those who work at and visit the Capitol.\n\nBullets are bullets, she said no matter what kind of gun a person brings.\n\nThere is no reason any gun belongs in the Capitol, it's absurd, the world thinks it's absurd, Polehanki said. It sickens me that this is even being considered as a viable action.\n\n___\n\nAnna Liz Nichols is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The Green New Dealers are taking their movement on the road.\n\nIt's been a whirlwind two months since the youth activists of the Sunrise Movement staged protests in Democratic leaders' offices, bringing into the mainstream calls for a Green New Deal ― a sweeping federal policy that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy and provide good-paying sustainable jobs to millions of Americans.\n\nNow the Sunrise Movement, likely the nation's fastest-growing climate advocacy group, is planning a 14-stop tour meant to drum up grassroots support for a Green New Deal across multiple states, HuffPost has learned. It's the first leg of the group's effort to make the policy the defining issue of the 2020 election.\n\nWe're launching the Road to a Green New Deal Tour to activate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven't heard of it yet, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of Sunrise Movement, said by email. When you come out to a tour stop, we'll give you all the tools you need to spread the word within your own community, build support, and pressure your elected officials to take a stand.\n\nIn March and April, the Sunrise Movement will host events in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere. The tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. Each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.\n\nThe goal of the tour is to invite tens of thousands of young people into the movement, Stephen O'Hanlon, a spokesman for Sunrise Movement, said by phone. We want to go where they are, and one thing we've learned … is young people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a Green New Deal could mean for their communities.\n\nReuters In a photo from three years ago, Varshini Prakash, then with the Divestment Student Network leads chants of I believe that we will win during a student climate protest in Washington.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement has added more than 100 new local chapters since November. That includes one in Wyoming, the nation's top coal-producing state, two in Nebraska, a hotbed of pipeline battles, and another two in deep-red Utah. The group has raised more than $500,000 in just two months, with 650 new recurring monthly donors.\n\nFounded officially in April 2017, the Sunrise Movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the Occupy Wall Street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. By the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the Sunrise Movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. Drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the group finally took form a few months after President Donald Trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.\n\nBy the time the midterm elections began, the Sunrise Movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. The group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Michigan gubernatorial hopeful Abdul El-Sayed. The Sunrise Movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.\n\nBut the breakthrough came in November, days after the election.\n\nHistoric wildfires in California, buttressed by back-to-back United Nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. Then Democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the House of Representatives, with Nancy Pelosi, not yet the next House speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. In response, the Sunrise Movement staged sit-in protests in Pelosi's office demanding Democrats instead champion a Green New Deal.\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, adding the political star power needed to grab headlines in a competitive, fast-moving news cycle. The 29-year-old socialist darling from New York also proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House, providing a counteroffer to Pelosi's panel.\n\nYoung people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a Green New Deal could mean for their communities. Stephen O'Hanlon , Sunrise Movement\n\nNearly 40 House Democrats and a handful of senators backed the resolution. More than half the Democrats expected to run for president in 2020 slowly endorsed a Green New Deal in some form or another. One poll pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\n\nPelosi and her allies kiboshed the effort last month, announcing plans to move ahead with the original select committee. But the push succeeded in making a Green New Deal a rallying cry.\n\nTouring the country could build a grassroots base for eventual Green New Deal legislation that the last major federal climate bill ― the 2009 cap-and-trade proposal known as the Waxman-Markey bill ― never received.\n\nThe politics have drastically changed since then, R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email. Sunrise is a grassroots-driven group, unlike some of the top-down green groups pushing Waxman-Markey, and they have both energy and moral clarity on their side.\n\nBut passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the Sunrise Movement faces considerable challenges. Labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. The Sunrise Movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential Green New Deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to E&E News. In a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.\n\nPlus, the Trump administration is stacked at every level with officials who reject the very reality that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, making it hard to envision Green New Deal legislation passing until 2021 at the earliest.\n\nOther climate groups have taken different approaches.\n\nThe Citizens' Climate Lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of Republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. Despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.\n\nThe Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign empowered local communities across the country to organize around shutting down coal-fired power plants, but it's limited in scope. The organization's broader 100 percent renewable energy effort struggled until the emergence of the Green New Deal rhetoric to address concerns over the impact on jobs.\n\nThe Environmental Voter Project went the wonk's route, using data to target specific voters it deemed likely to support green causes with aggressive get-out-the-vote materials. But it has a narrow focus, both in geography and mission.\n\nSunrise Movement Then-Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaking at the Sunrise Movement protest in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November.\n\nThe challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said of the upcoming Sunrise Movement tour. One-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, I would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.\n\nA series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the Sunrise Movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. The group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the Democratic hopefuls to take a position on the Green New Deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. It's also preparing to stage protests at as many Democratic debates as possible ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement is working with electoral groups such as Justice Democrats and Climate Hawks Vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a Green New Deal. Early polling already shows the group could make a difference. Democratic voters in New York's 4th Congressional District, a densely populated swath of suburban Long Island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) if she voted against a Green New Deal, according to survey data released last week.\n\nI feel the Sunrise Movement and their proposed Green New Deal is a genuinely exciting new development, Ed Maibach, a climate communications researcher at George Mason University, said by email. If the folks in the Sunrise Movement get out there and sell their idea to Americans before their opponents attempt to shoot it down, 2019 may prove to be an unexpectedly auspicious moment for climate solutions in America.
SAUL LOEB via Getty Images Michelle Obama, Jill Biden and Champ arrive to help assemble Mother's Day packages that deployed U.S. troops requested to be sent to their mothers and wives at home at the Naval Observatory in May 2012.\n\nThe inauguration of President Joe Biden is expected to bring a return to the Paris climate agreement, immigration reform, economic relief and more. On a less policy and more pawlicy-focused note, Biden's swearing-in to the highest office in the land also marks a return of dogs to the White House.\n\nThe president and first lady Jill Biden have two German shepherds, Champ and Major. While Champ joined the family by way of a Pennsylvania breeder in 2008, the Bidens adopted Major from the Delaware Humane Association in 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump famously bucked the tradition of White House pets. He was the first POTUS in about 150 years to have no pets at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nMajor's arrival will make him the first shelter dog at the White House. He is not, however, the first rescue dog. That distinction goes to Yuki, a terrier mix that Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter found abandoned at a Texas gas station in 1966.\n\nTo celebrate the first dogs, Dial Books for Young Readers released Champ and Major: First Dogs on Tuesday. The Delaware Humane Association also threw a virtual indoguration to raise awareness and funds for rescue pets ahead of Biden's inauguration.\n\nIn honor of this historic day and the return of pets to the White House, we've rounded up 18 photos and videos of Champ and Major.\n\nHappy Easter!

David Bernhardt, the Interior Department's No. 2 official and a former fossil fuel lobbyist, took over Wednesday as acting secretary after the resignation of scandal-plagued agency chief Ryan Zinke.\n\nWith Democrats on Thursday taking back control of the House of Representatives — and the powerful subpoena authority that comes with it — they have vowed to investigate Zinke's conduct and policy decisions.\n\nZinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, faced nearly 20 federal investigations. Several are ongoing, and one has been referred by Interior's internal watchdog to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations. He has maintained he did nothing wrong and blamed his departure on vicious and politically motivated attacks.\n\nBy midday Wednesday, his Twitter profile read former secretary. In a farewell message posted to the social media site, he said it was a high honor to serve @POTUS & the American People.\n\nWe've restored public lands 'for the benefit & enjoyment of the people,' improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs, Zinke wrote.\n\nIt's been a high honor to serve @POTUS & the American People as @Interior Secretary. We've restored public lands for the benefit & enjoyment of the people, improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs. God bless America & those who defend her. pic.twitter.com/JXzVmrpDTg — Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) January 2, 2019\n\nTrump has not nominated a permanent replacement, as he said he would do in a post to Twitter last month. But several names have surfaced as contenders for the role, including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and outgoing Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.). Whoever Trump taps must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nBefore being sworn in at the Interior Department on Aug. 1, 2017, Bernhardt, a Colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. He also previously served as a top Interior official under former President George W. Bush, leading an attempt to open Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. (Last month the Trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which Zinke said stands out among the most impactful Interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering America's economic strength and security.)\n\nThe Senate confirmed Bernhardt as Interior's deputy secretary in July 2017. Before his confirmation hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, citing his ties to the industries he is now charged with regulating and labeling him a walking conflict of interest.\n\nHe has so many potential conflicts that he carries around a list of former clients and is barred from participating in decisions affecting them, The Washington Post reported in November.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump and acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt (left) at a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Jan. 2, the first day Bernhardt was in charge of the department.\n\nAs Interior's deputy secretary, Bernhardt met on several occasions with lobbyists for MGM Resorts International, the casino-resort giant that his longtime former employer represents, as HuffPost previously reported. The ethics agreement he signed last year bars him from participating in matters involving Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.\n\nLast year the Interior Department blocked a proposed casino partnership between two Connecticut tribes. The project would have been competition for an MGM casino in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, and the company lobbied against federal approval. Interior's decision is under investigation by the agency's inspector general.\n\nBernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during Zinke's tenure, as Mother Jones highlighted in an October profile. Those efforts include a plan to dismantle Obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. Bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the Endangered Species Act, one of America's bedrock conservation laws. The proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.\n\nAfter news of Zinke's resignation, the liberal environmental group Western Values Project launched a website detailing Bernhardt's work with special interests. In an accompanying statement, the nonprofit's executive director, Chris Saeger, called Bernhardt the ultimate DC swamp creature.\n\nThe bottom line is that Bernhardt is too conflicted to even be Acting Secretary, Saeger said.\n\nBernhardt represented Interior at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting at the White House, sitting directly next to Trump.
The White House Correspondents Associations decided Wednesday to remove the far-right One America News Network from its seating rotation for daily coronavirus briefings because its reporter has repeatedly violated social distancing guidelines.\n\nThe association's board released a statement citing a policy it created last month that restricts seating at the White House's James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in order to comply with social distancing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnder the policy, White House correspondents have been asked not to attend the briefings if they don't have an assigned seat to ensure the safety of the White House press corps and White House staff during this difficult time.\n\nWe are writing to inform you that the WHCA Board has voted this evening to remove a news outlet from the rotation for a seat in the briefing room, the association's board said. We did this because a reporter for this outlet twice attended press briefings in contravention of this policy.\n\nWHCA Statement on Removing News Organization from News Briefing Seat Rotation pic.twitter.com/KL3XcPq7Rt — WHCA (@whca) April 1, 2020\n\nWednesday was the second time that an OANN correspondent attended the White House's daily coronavirus briefing in defiance of the WHCA's social distancing requirements. The correspondent, Chanel Rion, violated the policy by standing in the back of the room on two occasions when she was not listed on the briefing seat rotation.\n\nThe OAN person's first question was a loaded one meant to denigrate China.

This is a matter of public safety.\n\nRion made headlines for her racist remarks during an earlier coronavirus briefing when she asked a leading question about whether President Donald Trump considers the term Chinese food to be racist. (Trump has been rightfully criticized for calling the pandemic the Chinese Virus.)\n\nShe also attempted to peddle a right-wing conspiracy theory, saying American journalists have teamed up with Chinese Communist Party narratives and are siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic radicalism, Latin gangs and cartels.
Hey! It's Bushroot! In the flesh!\n\nThese six words shattered the little world that I created for myself during my freshman year at Syracuse University. Up until that point, I had considered myself to be pretty much nailing the whole college thing as I adjusted to life eight hours away from my Maryland childhood home. I was getting good grades, keeping my homesickness mostly in check, convincing myself that I enjoyed cheap beer and making new friends. Cool new friends. Cool new bro friends, to be exact.\n\nI was on cloud nine about being accepted into the Brewster Hall dorm crew, which was led by a group of guys who lived on the floor below me and who loved to do the ultimate college bro stuff, such as smoke weed and watch sports. One of them even initiated a hookup with me on the very first night of college. He was drunk ― and he never looked me in the eye after that ― but still.\n\nGrowing up, I was a bit of a late bloomer both physically and socially. I could hardly believe that these guys saw me for who I really was: a cute, fun, friendly girl who was cool enough to be privy to their inside jokes ― including and especially the one about Bushroot.\n\nBushroot was a squat, gnome-like creature that one of the bros had sketched out at the beginning of the semester to be our dorm mascot. It had bulging eyes and a dark shaded face ringed by short spiky hair. The guys proudly hung photocopies of the Bushroot sketch up on all their walls. They would approach the sketch and ask, Bushroot, should I take another hit from this bong? Or someone in the room would suddenly whisper 'Shroot and then they'd all repeat the name in turn, escalating the volume until they were shouting. They would invite the girls, myself included, to chant Bushroot along with them and then they would hoot and holler when we did.\n\nThen, one night, I found out that this mascot — and therefore the whole Bushroot joke — was supposed to be a caricature of me. A guy from a different dorm was hanging out in Brewster Hall. When he saw me face to face, he blurted out those six fateful words: Hey! It's Bushroot! In the flesh!\n\nI retreated to the privacy of my dorm room and tried to deny that I had heard him correctly. I'm Bushroot? I thought. The stupid-looking mascot thing that everyone thinks is so hilarious? How?!\n\nBut Bushroot had enough similarities to my appearance that I had to believe it. The shaded skin, for one. And the spiky hair. I understood that my Afro-style cropped cut was an unconventional look for our white, affluent, sorority-laden upstate New York campus. It was for me, too. I had never done anything so bold when it came to my appearance. I had gotten a burst of confidence after high school, though, and wanted to make a start strong in this new chapter in my life. I wanted to show up to college and really be someone.\n\nI just didn't want to be the dorm mascot.\n\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author sporting her newly cropped cut during her freshman year at Syracuse University in 2003.\n\nConsidering that this incident occurred at roughly the halfway point of my life to date, it could have made for a very nice turning point if we were following a typical Hollywood narrative.\n\nLeading up to Bushroot, I had spent nearly two decades as a girl who was half-Black but hellbent on being seen as fully white. From as early as I can remember, I harbored the belief that in white America, there was a minimum threshold that a human had to meet before the rest of society even considered whether that person could be cute, beautiful, sexy, professional and successful. And that threshold was ... whiteness. The way I saw it (and the way the world had made me see it), if you didn't look white, well then you better hope to be super talented at something that white America valued.\n\nParadoxically, I developed this hurtful white favoritism mindset while growing up in a multiracial family of transracial adoptees. I was adopted at birth by my white parents, who went on to adopt my white sister and four Black brothers. My parents espoused diversity, African American heritage, anti-racism and tolerance. We had open conversations about race and prejudice. I grew up surrounded by family friends and family members of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds.\n\nBut the messages I was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. As I got old enough to make my own decisions, I chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. I made no efforts to diversify my social circle. Ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.\n\nThrough it all, I felt like I was doing a pretty convincing job of passing as white, so long as I hid my hair. I saw my hair as the big giveaway. White people's hair hung down. My coarse, kinky curly hair expanded out.\n\nCourtesy of Lean Olson The author at age 4, when her hair finally grew long enough to assemble into some sort of bun (which she viewed as a thrilling milestone in my young eyes!).\n\nWhen my hair finally grew long enough, I always shoved it back into a thick braid or a tight bun to try and pull off a sporty look. But right before I left for Syracuse, I went out on a limb and got that short, cropped, natural curly cut.\n\nIf my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on TV, here's where I ― the Black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. I would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that I wanted so badly to be white in the first place. Post-Bushroot, I would have taken a hard look at all the other times I had experienced both covert and overt racism. I would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which I was the butt at Syracuse. I would have sought solace from other people of color ― maybe even my own family members ― who might have understood and helped me deal with my pain.\n\nBut I can't write that story.\n\nForget an arc ― my story became more linear than ever as I jacked up my quest to get white people to see and accept me as white.\n\nI first addressed my hair, which seemed like an obvious place to start at the time. I felt grateful that at this point in my life, I was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. I began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream. I figured it was the price I had to pay to scorch out any traces of Bushroot.\n\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author giving a toast while rocking her elusive straight hair at her sister's wedding in 2016. (Needless to say, chemicals were involved, she said.)\n\nI also went hardcore on tailoring my résumé, my friendships and my lifestyle in hopes of fitting in with white, privileged, affluent, well-respected America after I graduated from college. In 2007, I joined the education reform organization Teach For America for a two-year teaching commitment. Afterward, I attended Harvard Law School, graduated in 2012, and then worked for four years at top-tier corporate law firms in New York City and San Francisco.\n\nThe whole time, I was surrounded by a lot of white people. A lot. However, I take far less issue with that ― I made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than I do with my attitude along the way. I was in full-on racial denial. I didn't even join any affinity groups for Black, Indigenous and other people of color or try to make any friends who looked like me.\n\nAt first, while I was still hurting inside, I felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as I could from the position of being a victim of racism. I would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, Suck it, Syracuse! As I became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. I am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka Type A), so I began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were. I began to go long stretches of time without thinking about Syracuse or Bushroot or any of that pain. In fact, I never told a soul about Bushroot until this year.\n\nNow, I am finally finding an arc, thanks to the boys ― not the Syracuse ones, but my own.\n\nIn a plot twist that I find a little bit hilarious and a little bit fated, my white husband and I are the biological parents to two sons who are as different in appearance as day and night ― pun intended.\n\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author with her sons, ages 2 and 4 months, respectively, in the spring of 2020.\n\nI'll pause here to acknowledge that, yes, I married a white guy. My husband loves me for all of who I am, inside and out. He has been a strong supporter of my identity journey. He is an incredible father to our kids. But he is indeed a white guy. Like, Scandinavian ancestors on both sides white. And our first son looks like a carbon copy of those ancestors. Fair skin, blue eyes, stick-straight towhead blond hair.\n\nConsider this child next to me. We turn heads when we're out in public. Strangers cannot get enough of our brown-blond combo. Sometimes even I catch myself doing a double take at us and thinking about how not even my AP Biology teacher back in high school could have predicted this outcome.\n\nSo maybe it was the universe at work in some way, right? My first son came to me with the message: Stop hiding! You're not white! And now everyone's going to be calling you out on it!\n\nAnd then came his brother.\n\nAlmost exactly two years later, my husband and I were blessed with our second son, who looks like a carbon copy of me. Brown eyes (no real hair yet) and brown skin that is somehow even a little darker than mine.\n\nThis son brought his own message: Stop hiding! We're not white! But we are both beautiful just the way we are!\n\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author's younger son at 9 months old.\n\nIt took welcoming these two beautiful boys into the world for me to realize the journey I had been on was not the journey I wanted to stay on. I do not know what would've happened if I had not become a mother to them ― if the realization that I was hiding from who I really am had not accompanied them when they appeared in my world. But it did. And it made me rethink ― and re-feel ― everything.\n\nSo here I am, in all of my vulnerable glory. I am sharing the Bushroot story to belatedly call out racism and cruelty but also to illustrate just how powerful white favoritism and, let's be honest, white supremacy can be in this society. By hiding the pain that I felt at Syracuse and, more generally, by focusing so much time and energy throughout my life into trying to convince others and myself that I am just as white as they are, I have undoubtedly caused pain to myself and to those who look like me. I don't want to do that anymore. Especially not to my son.\n\nMy identity journey is not over. On the contrary, it's just beginning. There's a lot that I still don't know, but here is what I do know: Being honest is important. It doesn't mean you have to have all of the answers or have to be ready to take some dramatic action to prove a point. It just means that you have to be ready to be raw.\n\nBeing raw is OK. Admitting pain is OK. Apologizing is OK. And it's never too late to come home to yourself.\n\nI want to be honest about my racial identity for me, for my kids and for my country. I want us to make some profound progress in making America a more accepting place where people can feel more and, ultimately, hurt less. I want to be exactly who I am, and I want my sons — and, really, everyone — to feel confident to do the same.\n\nLeah Olson is working on a memoir about growing up biracial in white America.

This article is the first in a seven-part series, One Year Later: Larry Nassar And The Women Who Made Us Listen, that commemorates the seven days women stood in a Lansing, Michigan, courtroom last year and read powerful impact statements to former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State trainer Larry Nassar. One Year Later was produced by reporter Alanna Vagianos. Read more installments: One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven\n\nOne year ago, almost to the day, Morgan McCaul stood in a tiny courtroom in Lansing, Michigan, ready to face down her abuser, former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar. With her pixie-cut hair and tortoiseshell glasses, the diminutive 18-year-old University of Michigan student didn't look especially formidable.\n\nThen she started speaking.\n\nEvery shred of admiration I had for you is gone, McCaul told Nassar, the doctor she said she'd once respected and called a friend. The man I thought I knew did not exist, only a selfish predator whose atrocities know no bounds.\n\nThe beige courtroom, ordinarily unremarkable, hummed with energy that day as dozens of women waited their turn to read victim impact statements to the man who'd turned their lives upside down at some point in the past two decades. An army of more than 150 survivors had arrived for battle.\n\nSince reports of Larry Nassar's misconduct to Michigan State faculty began in 1997, two years before I was even born, I can't help but wonder, McCaul continued. How many little girls could have been spared from this lifelong battle if someone at the university had just done the bare minimum and listened?\n\nWhen McCaul finished, she stepped back from the podium, emotional but resolute, and stared down Nassar.\n\nNearly 365 days later, McCaul says it was this moment and that historic sentence hearing that changed her life forever.\n\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Morgan McCaul, age 19, holds her original impact statement about Larry Nassar that she read in court last year.\n\nDays before McCaul and her legion of self-proclaimed sister survivors confronted Nassar in court, I published a piece about the 140 women who had publicly accused Nassar of sexual abuse at the time. While their stories had commanded attention in the Lansing area (thanks to first-rate reporting from local media), they hadn't yet garnered the international attention they would ultimately receive. It was frustrating, and disappointing, to see dozens of stories of serial abuse brushed aside by mainstream media.\n\nHalf a dozen survivors described a feeling of hopelessness before the sentencing, telling HuffPost last year that it seemed as if the country simply did not care about the abuse they experienced. Some attributed it to sexism. Others believed the lack of public attention was because most of Nassar's victims were not Olympic gymnasts.\n\nWe couldn't get anybody to pay attention to this. We tried so hard and we couldn't get people to care, Sarah Klein, an attorney and one of the first known victims of Nassar, told HuffPost this year. We knew that what Michigan State had done was wrong. We knew that what USAG had done was wrong, and we wanted so badly to tell our story, but we couldn't get any traction.\n\nIt was a sentence hearing, of all things, that finally made the country take notice. On Jan. 16, 2018, in a tiny Michigan courtroom, 169 women and family members began reading gut-wrenching victim impact statements to the once-famed sports medicine doctor.\n\nI could just feel it in that room. Finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening. Amanda Thomashow, MSU graduate and Nassar survivor\n\nI could just feel it in that room, Nassar survivor and MSU graduate Amanda Thomashow told HuffPost. Finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening.\n\nIt's common for victims of a crime to be given the opportunity to read a statement. But this was different. Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina took a unique and at times controversial approach, allowing every single person to speak ― which meant that instead of lasting a day or two, the hearing ran an entire week.\n\nI got to bring that little girl that I once was with me into court and up to that podium, Klein told HuffPost. And I got to speak for her.\n\nThat week, and those women, forced the country to finally confront Nassar's heinous abuse and the institutional complicity that enabled him for so long.\n\nBy the end of the seven days, prosecutors had identified more than 265 accusers. And that was before more survivors faced down Nassar during an additional sentencing in Charlotte, Michigan.\n\nJEFF KOWALSKY via Getty Images People in the courtroom react as former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar listens during impact statements during the sentencing phase in Ingham County Circuit Court on January 24, 2018 in Lansing, Michigan.

A year later, now that the public is finally listening, I wanted to know ― have MSU and USAG righted their wrongs?\n\nI find it really interesting how many people are still willing to put money and medals and institutional reputation ahead of survivors ― even under intense public scrutiny, McCaul said.\n\nAll the women agreed: The country may finally be paying attention, but USA Gymnastics and Michigan State are not.\n\nI still fear that the institutions are not listening, Harrison, an MSU graduate and former gymnast and soccer player, said. Sexual assault survivors should never have to beg to be listened to or believed, and unfortunately I feel like that's what we've had to do this past year.\n\nTime and again, MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee have neglected to remedy decades of institutional failures, despite embarrassing resignations, criminal charges and even bankruptcy.\n\nAt MSU, former President Lou Anna K. Simon, former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages and former MSU dean of osteopathic medicine and Nassar's former boss William Strampel have been charged with lying to the police, willful neglect of duty and, in the case of Strampel, sexual misconduct.\n\nEven more distressing to many survivors, MSU interim President John Engler closed a $10 million healing fund in December originally set aside for counseling and other services for Nassar victims. The school redirected that money into an existing $500 million settlement divided between the 332 women who'd sued the school. This move left dozens of other accusers, who were not part of the lawsuit, unable to collect support funding for necessary counseling and other mental health services. (Last week, MSU's board of trustees voted to establish a new fund, although board Chair Dianne Byrum said the details are still to be worked out.)\n\nSmith, a dance teacher, scoffed at MSU's incompetence in its attempts to course-correct after the Nassar scandal.\n\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost jess a c\n\nI teach students as young as 2, and in my experience, 2-year-olds are better at taking responsibility than Michigan State University, she said. Children don't necessarily understand what they're doing, but they understand when their friend says 'That hurts me.'\n\nThomashow said that for MSU to improve, the school needs to listen to the team of experts and advocates it has on hand as part of the recently created Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Expert Advisory Workgroup. The group consists of rock star advocates, Thomashow said, including Andrea Munford, the lead MSU Special Victims Unit detective who broke open the Nassar case in 2016.\n\nI know that they have it in them at MSU, Thomashow said. It's just listening to the experts and actually having a trauma-informed, evidence-based approach to sexual assault prevention and response.\n\nSuch a response would typically entail training officials on the importance of believing survivors and combating victim blaming. It would also include law enforcement training about how trauma works, and its effects on delayed reporting and memory loss. The university has not yet rolled out programs specifically addressing these issues.\n\nMeanwhile, at USA Gymnastics, former president Steve Penny and former trainer Debbie Van Horn face criminal charges as well. Van Horn was indicted in June on allegations that she sexually assaulted a child while working at the infamous USAG training facility, the Karolyi Ranch in Walker County, Texas.\n\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Amanda Thomashow, age 29, poses for a portrait on the bed where she originally wrote her impact statement about Larry Nassar a year ago.\n\nIn one of the most glaring missteps, USAG appointed Mary Lee Tracy to the prestigious role of elite development coordinator, only to learn that she'd defended Nassar in December 2016, when more than 50 women had already accused him of serial sexual abuse. Days later, she resigned.\n\nFor its part, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the very organization tasked with righting the ship post-Nassar, has not been able to land on its feet. The organization announced in November that it planned to decertify USA Gymnastics, but USAG filed for bankruptcy ― a last-ditch effort to stabilize the flailing organization ― before the decertification could take place. As of this writing, USA Gymnastics is still up and running.\n\nLast month, it was revealed that two USOC top officials deleted emails containing disturbing accusations against Nassar in 2015, and failed to report it. One of the officials was fired over the revelation; the other had stepped down some months before.\n\nMcCaul toggled between anger, frustration and flat-out exhaustion as she discussed the various institutional errors.\n\nIf international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? she said, adding that money repeatedly took precedence over girls' lives.\n\nIf international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? Morgan McCaul, University of Michigan student and Nassar survivor\n\nReached for comment, representatives for USAG and Michigan State each expressed remorse for the survivors' trauma while pointing to changes their respective institutions have made post-Nassar.\n\nOne year ago, more than 150 courageous women made gymnastics, and all sports, safer by sharing their stories and the personal impact of Larry Nassar's despicable crimes, Kathryn Carson, chair of USA Gymnastics' board of directors, told HuffPost. We deeply regret the horrific acts that hurt so many of our athletes. We will never forget and are forever grateful for their bravery in coming forward.\n\nCarson said a lot has changed in the past year, citing turnover in USAG's leadership and noting that the group has implemented safe sport policies and worked to create a culture of greater accountability.\n\nWe know we have more work to do, she said. We are committed to taking the needed steps toward fostering a positive, encouraging and safe environment where all of our members are comfortable in speaking up and have the opportunity to thrive and follow their gymnastics dreams.\n\nEmily Guerrant, a spokeswoman for MSU, told HuffPost the university is extraordinarily sorry for all the harm Nassar's crimes and the school's own failures have caused.\n\nAs we learn and move forward, the university continues to engage and invest in an intense reform and cultural change effort to ensure Michigan State University is a safe campus for students, faculty, staff and our community, she said. MSU has made many strides in addressing sexual misconduct situations, including implementing a new chaperone policy and strengthening mandatory reporting policies for all staff.\n\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Morgan McCaul, age 19, inside her apartment in Ann Arbor Michigan. Morgan is studying Political Science Student at the University of Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for three different institutions that failed women equally. The cleanup promises to be complicated, as the organizations attempt to unlearn decades of bad behavior.\n\nMcCaul, like Thomashow, stressed the importance of prioritizing and centering survivors in Nassar's wake.\n\nIf the health and the well-being of the people that you hurt is at the forefront of your mind, I think that that will create an environment and create a mindset for actual progress, she said.\n\nAnd if the past year has proven anything, it's that the sister survivors will stop at nothing to hold these organizations accountable. All of the women agreed that their fight isn't over.\n\nIt's clear that fame, money and attention is what's motivating them, Smith said of USA Gymnastics and MSU. Let's be clear, though, you can't buy us off. There's no amount of money, there's no amount of fame or attention that can get us to stop.\n\nOne Year Later: Larry Nassar And The Women Who Made Us Listen is a seven-part series that commemorates the seven days women stood in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina's Lansing, Michigan, courtroom last January and read powerful victim impact statements to former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State trainer Larry Nassar.

Theresa May has survived a no-confidence vote in her government and fended off Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to force a general election.\n\nMPs voted by a slim margin of 19 votes to express their confidence in the prime minister's government despite her historic defeat on her Brexit deal a day earlier. The result was expected after Brexit supporting-politicians who opposed her deal in large numbers nevertheless backed her government to continue.\n\nMay said immediately after the vote she would embark on a round of cross-party talks to find a way out of the Brexit deadlock amid suggestions from cabinet ministers that she could be edging towards a softer withdrawal from the EU.\n\nLabour policy prioritizes forcing a general election, though Corbyn is coming under intensifying pressure to explicitly back a second referendum. 71 Labour MPs have called for Corbyn to unequivocally back a second referendum now that his no-confidence motion has failed.\n\nWe shouldn't have any further delay, Louise Ellman, a senior Labour lawmaker, said. The clock is ticking. It's just over 70 days to go before we actually leave the EU. We can't afford to do that, so Jeremy must act now.\n\nBut senior party figures indicated he was ready to table repeated no-confidence challenges and therefore stall the process by which he could be forced to back another referendum.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Corbyn is facing internal pressure to back a second EU referendum\n\nOpening the debate on the no-confidence motion, Corbyn urged May's zombie government to stand aside and declared her Frankenstein Brexit deal officially dead.\n\nHe attacked the PM for presiding over the largest defeat in the history of our democracy on her Brexit deal before saying there has been no offer of all-party talks from the prime minister to break the impasse.\n\nHe also criticized the government record on issues beyond leaving the EU before facing Tory taunts, with former minister Anna Soubry labelling him the most hopeless leader of the opposition we've ever had.\n\nResponding, May dismissed his call for a general election saying it would be the worst thing we could do.\n\nIt would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, she told MPs.\n\nMeanwhile, former Labour MP John Woodcock, who quit the party while suspended amid harassment allegations, did not support the no-confidence motion because Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell are simply not fit to hold public office.\n\nThe public deserve so much better than this choice in the broken political system than they are being given, he said.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.

By Hong Soon-do, Beijing correspondent, AsiaToday - China's political world had been dominated by various factions before Xi Jinping took power at the 18th Chinese Communist Party (CCP) National Congress in 2012. But now there are signs of unification of political factions within the party. While China's socialist system and the regime remain unchanged, we could even say that no other faction than the Xi Jinping faction is left in China.\n\nAccording to Beijing sources familiar with the Chinese government information on Wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the CCP leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. They are the Communist Youth League faction and the Shanghai faction. They deserved to be the main powers since the Youth League faction produced former President Hu Jintao and Premier Li Keqiang, and the Shanghai faction produced former President Jiang Zemin. Their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. But now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. It's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. Chinese vice chair Li Yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of Hu Jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.\n\n[Chinese President Xi Jinping and his allies. The picture is taken during their Europe visit in 2014./ Source: Xinhua News Agency]\n\nOn the other hand, Xi Jinping's close allies are being promoted to key positions. It can be clearly seen from the recent reshuffle. What's most eye-catching is the position of mayor Shanghai. Ying Yong, a former close subordinate of Xi Jinping, is expected to step up from deputy role to replace Yang Xiong, who is considered a member of the Shanghai faction.\n\n[Ying Yong, a former close subordinate of President Xi Jinping, is expected to be appointed mayor of Shanghai./ Source: Xinhua News Agency]\n\nWe should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. Xi's long-time speechwriter Li Shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. The appointment shows that the Chinese president is seeking to train Li to be secretary Wang Qishan's successor.\n\nIn addition, we should not ignore the appointment of Zhang Guoqing and Chen Yixin as mayors of Chongqing and Hubei provinces, respectively. Zhang and Chen's appointments show Xi Jinping's intentions to train young bloods in order to increase his control in the future.\n\nSuch trend is expected to continue for a while. In short, the signs of the unification of political factions may have already become reality.
Employees of the music equipment retailer Guitar Center have been told they must sign mandatory arbitration agreements or they will lose their jobs.\n\nThe agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post, forces employees to relinquish their rights to sue the company in class action lawsuits over wage violations, workplace discrimination and unjust firings, among other disputes.\n\nSean Lynch, a sales employee at the company's Las Vegas store, said he and his colleagues were told they must sign the agreement by end of day Friday or they forfeit their jobs.\n\nIt was imposed on us and we have absolutely no choice, Lynch told HuffPost.\n\nArbitration agreements have become highly controversial for the way they hamstring employees and weaken their legal power. By sending disputes to an arbitrator, they force workers to pursue their claims individually and outside of court, preempting any collective action. And even though they're supposed to be neutral third parties, arbitrators are often cozy with the companies that workers are squaring off with, as The New York Times detailed in a recent series.\n\nA Guitar Center spokeswoman said the company declined to comment.\n\nCorporations are increasingly demanding that employees and consumers agree to mandatory arbitration, whether signatories realize it or not. Nowadays, the clauses are often tucked into welcome packets as boilerplate for new hires to sign. But in the case of Guitar Center, it appears the new policy is being imposed suddenly on longtime employees like Lynch, who says he's worked for the company for seven years.\n\nThe Las Vegas resident said he and his co-workers learned about the agreements in December when they signed in to do routine computer training. The PowerPoint-style sessions are usually devoted to matters like music equipment or workplace safety, he said. But in this case, the session was all about arbitration, and why it was good for the company and the worker.\n\nIn a question-and-answer sheet on the new policy, Guitar Center says that going to an arbitrator is less costly, less formal, friendlier and faster than going through the courts. The document assures a fair and impartial process, and notes that Guitar Center will pick up the tab for the arbitration (though not for the employee's lawyer, if he or she chooses one). The company is clear that the agreement is mandatory:\n\nAs a condition of new or continued employment, all new and current associates are required to electronically acknowledge and agree to be bound by the Arbitration Program and related agreement.\n\nLynch said he has been circulating a petition in his store that he intends to submit to management on Friday. He plans to sign the arbitration agreement, but not without protest. He said he can't afford to lose his job.\n\nMy main concern with it is that it's 'do it or else,' Lynch said.\n\nGuitar Center has been wrapped up in a nasty labor dispute with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which provided the arbitration documents to HuffPost. In 2013, RWDSU won elections at three Guitar Center stores, including Las Vegas, but the union is still without a contract at any of them. The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, leading to a recent two-week trial. A decision hasn't yet been issued.\n\nLiz Vladeck, a lawyer with Cary Kane LLP who represents the union, said she questions the legality of Guitar Center requiring its employees to sign such a document. Although federal courts have ruled different ways on the issue, the NLRB has declared that such mandatory agreements illegally infringe on a worker's right to protected concerted activity with colleagues.\n\nWhile Guitar Center's agreement says workers can still pursue certain claims, such as unemployment insurance or workers' compensation, the language rules out a strikingly broad array of situations -- including any other violation of federal, state or local law.\n\nWe're analyzing the agreement in light of the labor board's recent cases. We're considering filing a new charge and pursuing a new round of action, Vladeck said. What's great is a lot of workers have been individually protesting. They're organizing themselves.
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters With the elections of Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock and Joe Biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform.\n\nWhen the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after Election Day, Democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the Senate where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tie-breaking votes.\n\nThe wins for Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff unlock much more hope that the Biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the Trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate and the House, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.\n\nAnd Democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. That would mean getting 10 Republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. But there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and Democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most.\n\nThe only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the Senate adopted and can easily end. Reforming the filibuster is something Biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several Democratic senators have said they would oppose that.\n\nStill, progressive reforms in these areas now look a whole lot more possible than they did last week:\n\nMinimum Wage And Labor\n\nA Democratic majority in the Senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. The federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. With Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the White House, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.\n\nDemocratic control of the Senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The legislation, which the Democratic-controlled House had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. The measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate Senate Democrats.\n\nAt the very least, a Democratic Senate should allow Biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the Trump era ― not just legislatively through the Congressional Review Act, but by reshaping the National Labor Relations Board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. The Trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. If Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is deposed as the Senate's leader, Biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.\n\nVoting Rights And Campaign Finance\n\nReauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and a suite of voting rights and campaign finance and ethics reforms were already at the top of congressional Democrats' priority list before they won control of the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nParamount among these is the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. The proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former Democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the VRA in compliance with the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. That decision freed state-level Republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. Former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for Lewis.\n\nHouse Democrats also plan to pass the For The People Act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. The bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. Other bills like the Protect Our Democracy Act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as Donald Trump did, will also get a Senate hearing now.\n\nThe Judiciary\n\nBiden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) leading the Senate Judiciary Committee than he would have with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the helm. Since Trump and McConnell filled almost every open judicial seat that Republicans had prevented Obama from filling, Biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.\n\nTrump transformed the Supreme Court with three new justices, the most named by any president since Ronald Reagan. Progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal Stephen Breyer, the oldest Supreme Court justice at 82, to retire as soon as Biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. Democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If Breyer does step down, Biden is expected to nominate the first Black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.\n\nThe Social Safety Net\n\nOutside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, Democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. They've mostly played defense against Trump and congressional Republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.\n\nBut there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. Democratic leaders included this proposal in their COVID-19 relief demands late last year.\n\nAs for expanding Social Security retirement benefits, party leaders previously declined to give a hearing to such a proposal, though they said nice things about it.\n\nTaxes, Maybe\n\nBiden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that Republicans enacted at the end of 2017.\n\nCongressional Democrats also want to reverse some of Trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that Republicans included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which Democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.\n\nClimate And A Green New Deal\n\nZeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the U.S. economy, and Biden will need new legislation to do that.\n\nDuring their campaigns, neither Warnock nor Ossoff endorsed the Green New Deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a World War II-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. But both Georgia Democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and Warnock, a Baptist reverend, draws on a long history of Black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.\n\nThere will still be pushback from conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that Congress considered. Manchin, Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) voted against a resolution in March 2019 outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Newly elected Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.\n\nBut lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. Last month, Congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. The federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.\n\nHealth Care\n\nThe Affordable Care Act ― Biden's famous B.F.D. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of Americans, it needs work. Biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer Medicare for All system. A fully Democratic Congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.\n\nEven with Republicans out of legislative power, Biden faces a potential crisis in the Supreme Court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The Republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that Congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. Biden and a Democratic Congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the ACA and rendering the lawsuit moot.\n\nProtecting the ACA is but a preliminary step. Biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like HealthCare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. Biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. And he has called for lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a Democratic majority makes possible.\n\nImmigration\n\nBiden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse Trump's immigration policies, but Democratic control of Congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform.\n\nThe incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. He's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers.\n\nA number of measures now have a chance of passing the Senate, including the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (or NO BAN Act), which passed the House last July. It would immediately terminate Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban.\n\nBiden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from Venezuela, Guatemala and Hong Kong, among others. The House passed a bill to do that last month, but Republicans in the Senate blocked it. The president-elect has also pledged to work with Congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.\n\nPaid Leave And Childcare\n\nIt's hard to imagine a better moment for Democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. The coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.\n\nLawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. Biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.\n\nThe quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. Republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in December, and they expired on Jan. 1.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. But it's now possible for Congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. Biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.\n\nEducation\n\nOn the higher education front, Biden's agenda focuses on hiking funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and doubling the value of Pell grants, which help low-income students attend college. Both goals are possible with a simple Senate majority.\n\nAnother goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from Republicans, making it less likely. How much action Biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. Expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what Biden proposed as a candidate.\n\nThere's new hope of passing COVID-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, K-12 schools and universities. Biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. There's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year.
Four years ago, on Jan. 21, 2017, nearly half a million people showed up for the Women's March in Washington, D.C., and millions more joined around the world to protest the kinds of unjust and racist policies expected from the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was a day of anger, but also unity and joy. Parents brought their kids, women sported pink pussy hats, and people carried homemade signs with statements like A woman's place is in the revolution! and Make America gay again.\n\nIt was also a day of dire warnings. Women warned that Trump's racist, misogynistic and violent rhetoric would have real consequences. In the years after, those fears were borne out in his policies and practices.\n\nNearly four years later, on Jan. 6 of this year, a mob of Trump's most fervent supporters ― incited by the then-president himself ― violently stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nTrump's presidency was thus bookended by two very different groups registering their reactions to losing an election. To Women's March organizers, the end came as no surprise.\n\nWomen said this would happen, noted Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women's March. This is exactly who we knew Trump to be. This is exactly who we said he was. And this is exactly why we got him out of office. Because this attempted coup is just the beginning of what he could have done if he got another four years.\n\nOn the four-year anniversary of that first protest, HuffPost spoke to Linda Sarsour, an original organizer and co-chair of the Women's March. (She is no longer affiliated with the group. Sarsour and two other original co-chairs stepped down from their positions at the organization in 2019 after reported in-fighting and accusations of anti-Semitism.)\n\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Getty Linda Sarsour speaks during a National Day of Action for a Dream Act Now protest on Feb. 7, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\n\nLooking back at that day four years ago and the organizing that happened around that first historic Women's March, how do you feel now?\n\nI feel proud. The Women's March was a warning to the country that we were going to mobilize in large numbers to hold this administration accountable. We reached women across the country, including a majority of women who never ever marched or organized a day in their lives, and we were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. A white woman won't be free if Black women and Muslim women and refugee women are not free. It was a very powerful message.\n\nIt was fascinating to see the comparison of the beginning of Trump's presidency to the end, the crazy contrast of people registering their reactions to losing an election. One, the Women's March, was peaceful and joyous, while the other was a violent insurrection.\n\nThe difference between us and insurrectionists is that our march stood for something. It wasn't just a march against Donald Trump. It was a march for racial justice and gender justice and climate justice. We gave people something to aspire for.\n\nHow do you reflect on that contrast?\n\nOutside of the Women's Marches, I reflect on the direct action that was led by women over the last four years. I remember in 2018, during the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers, we organized the largest women-led civil disobedience in history. And the Capitol Police figured out how to arrest over 640 women that day who were engaged in non-violent direct action inside of the Senate Hart building in the atrium.\n\nAs a Women's March leader, I remember during the [Brett] Kavanaugh hearing I was the first protester in that Senate chamber, and all I did was get up and say, This is a travesty of justice. This is a mockery of justice. That's all I did. And I was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the Capitol Police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. I did not engage in violence. I did not have any weapons. I was an unarmed woman just saying that I was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and I was brutalized by the Capitol Police.\n\nWe were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. A white woman won't be free if Black women and Muslim women and refugee women are not free. Linda Sarsour\n\nSo, for me, when I watched insurrectionists and white supremacists storm the Capitol ― people who had announced days in advance that they were coming to the Capitol ― and to see that they were treated with kid gloves really shows you everything we were trying to expose in the last four years under this administration. Law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. And I've experienced that. I've been arrested over 20 times on Capitol Hill grounds, inside the Capitol and outside the Capitol. So to watch people just walk right in, break windows, steal mail from federal government officials ― it was a very triggering but eye-opening experience for the rest of the country.\n\nHow do you think the women who marched in 2017 can channel that energy into four years of a Biden presidency? A president they likely see far more common ground with, but still need to demand big change from.\n\nWhat is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. We've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. I believe that the Women's March ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the Women's March ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. We cannot defeat Donald Trump or his policies in silos. Once Donald Trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. So I think in the next four years, under the Biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.\n\nI just came from Georgia. I lived there for a month during the Senate runoff and I saw some of the most remarkable organizing. That, for me, is a reflection of what is possible over the next four years ― to push this administration to do the right thing. If you see even some of the policies that Biden has already proposed and some of the first-day executive orders, one of them is repealing the Muslim ban. That was a big campaign that came out of our movement.\n\nSo I feel proud. I hope that women, particularly those who were never really organizers and started becoming active in the last four years, I hope that they see the fruits of their labor. I hope that Black and brown organizers who have been organizing for decades see the fruits of their labor. That's what I'm excited about.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.
After the end of the Cold War some 30 years ago, public debate and understanding of the enormous scale of impact of nuclear war fell to very low levels. This has changed with recent nuclear weapons tests and missile firings by North Korea. In this article I explain why the threat of nuclear war may now be higher than it has ever been and why we should all be aware of the latest scientific studies of the impacts of nuclear weapons.\n\nTwo nuclear war scenarios\n\nThere are approximately 14,900 nuclear weapons ready to fire or in stockpiles. 13,800 are deployed by the USA and Russia, while the remaining 1,100 are deployed by China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan and Israel. North Korea may have a handful of weapons. Based a range of published or leaked nuclear war plans and statements by political leaders, there are two key types of nuclear war to consider.\n\nThe first is a global nuclear war involving the US and Russia. In this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. This is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.\n\nThe other main scenario is a 'regional conflict', for example between India and Pakistan. In this case at least 100 smaller nuclear weapons would be used out of stockpiles of around 200 weapons striking mainly large densely populated super cities such as Delhi and Karachi. A North Korea – US scenario could be similar but with fewer but larger warheads being used.\n\nEveryone understands that any such conflict would cause unprecedented levels of deaths and suffering, but what is not well understood is just how vulnerable modern society is. On top of this, the most up to date scientific studies predict serious and long lasting global climate impacts leading to widespread crop failure and famine.\n\nThe increased risk of nuclear war\n\nSince the Cold War, both the US and Russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. This nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. But this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. Now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. Many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.\n\nThe vulnerability of society to nuclear attack\n\nThe use of a nuclear warhead causes a series of severe impacts: Intense nuclear radiation and a blinding flash of light much brighter than the sun; a fierce fireball lasting several seconds; an intense blast wave; minutes or hours later, large-scale deposition of radioactive particles as fallout.\n\nSurvivors of the bombs dropped over Japan at the end of World War 2 speak of a bright sunlit day plunged into darkness as black oily rain fell. Dead figures, charred black still standing. Burned and terminally injured survivors, their skin hanging off; eyes and other internal organs hanging out of their bodies. Cars and vehicles tossed like toys, strong structures reduced to piles of rubble. Huge fires.\n\nUse of a nuclear weapon today would be much worse for two reasons: a typical modern nuclear weapon is now 8 to 80 times larger; modern society is much more reliant on vulnerable information technology and long distance supply routes for food and fuel.\n\nModern society is heavily reliant on electricity to power central heating pumps, to provide water, information via TV, the internet and mobile phones. Nuclear strike will mean no water supply, no heating or lighting, no information, no mobile phone signal.\n\nOnly a few days' food supply exists in regional distribution depots. The supply network would fail for multiple reasons: road blockages, communications breakdown, collapse of the banking system, destruction of ports.\n\nInternational aid organisations and health bodies all agree that the tens of thousands of casualties from just one nuclear bomb would overwhelm all attempts to help the injured. As a result, there would be no hope of treatment for severe injuries including burns, broken bones, deep cuts from flying debris.\n\nTo add to the multiple impacts, most locations in Western Europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. You may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. Radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. Children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.\n\nWith the intense levels of damage, huge fires would spread across all major towns and other targets, burning them out in huge fires lasting days to weeks. We now understand that these huge fires would cause long lasting climatic impacts at a global level.\n\nA nuclear winter\n\nIntense city-wide fires loft extensive high-altitude smoke clouds similar to a large volcanic eruption. These clouds block sunlight causing cooling. The latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional India-Pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. A 1,800 US - Russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°C, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°C. This is greater than the average cooling of 5°C experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.\n\nWhilst an average cooling of only a few degrees may not sound very serious, the crucial impact is much longer periods of frost in winter and severe drought. There would be dramatically reduced growing seasons or even the impossibility of growing any crop as planned. Farming also relies upon supplies of fuel for mechanised planting and harvesting.\n\nRealistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. Assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. It has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.\n\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that any use of nuclear weapons would be a global disaster and cause unacceptable suffering. Nuclear weapons do not keep us safe but under a constant threat of disaster. We now know we have avoided this only by sheer luck in several nuclear close-calls. In 2017, this understanding led 122 countries at the United Nations, to support a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in the same fashion as chemical and biological weapons and to press the nuclear-armed states to negotiate major reductions in weapons. We need to get rid of nuclear weapons before they get rid of us.\n\nYou can find out more about Scientists for Global Responsibility here.\n\nHuffPost UK Tech has launched HuffPost-Apocalypse, a project that aims to investigate what an apocalypse would mean for humanity, how we can best delay the end of the world, what the world will look like after we're gone and what the best viable options for survival will be for anyone left.

William Becker served for nearly two decades as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Energy, specializing in energy efficiency and renewable energy. In 2007 he left DOE to create the Presidential Climate Action Project, which convenes national thought leaders to develop recommendations on federal policies to promote clean energy and to combat global climate change. Bill began his career in journalism, beginning at age 19 as a combat correspondent for the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War. He has been a reporter with the Associated Press and the publisher of his own weekly newspaper in rural Wisconsin, where he proposed and helped implement the relocation of flood-prone village to higher ground and its reconstruction as the nation's first solar-heated community. The village is nationally recognized as a pioneer of nonstructural flood prevention. Since then, he has assembled teams of experts to help disaster-affected cities rebuild as more sustainable and resilient communities, ranging from the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to the reconstruction of homes in Thailand for victims of the Christmas Tsunami. Bill has had an eclectic career including stints as the research director for the Republican caucus in the Wisconsin State Senate; Executive Assistant to Wisconsin's Attorney General; and Counselor to the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. He has authored several books and major policy studies. He lectures nationally and internationally on sustainable development, clean energy and how to address global warming.\n\nShow Full Bio
President Joe Biden has revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, effectively killing the controversial project and jump-starting what he's promised will be a seismic shift in U.S. climate policy after four years of inaction under Donald Trump.\n\nThe executive order on the oil pipeline, which Biden signed just hours after his inauguration, is part of an anticipated blitz of early executive actions to reverse Trump-era policies. Several are expected to target the previous administration's industry-friendly rollbacks of environmental regulations.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris have pledged aggressive government action to combat the global climate crisis, and in recent weeks they've assembled what environmentalists have hailed as an all-star team to lead that effort. As promised, Biden signed a second executive order Wednesday to rejoin the Paris climate accord.\n\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself, Biden said during his inauguration speech. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now.\n\nRevoking the permit for Keystone XL is part of a broader day-one executive order to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice, according to the administration. Those efforts include potentially strengthening fuel economy and emissions standards; directing the Interior Department to protect our nation's treasures by reviewing and possibly reversing Trump's rollbacks of protected national monuments, including Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante; and temporarily banning all oil and gas leasing activities in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIt comes as a major blow for a fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been plagued by setbacks and litigation over the last decade.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama rejected Keystone XL, saying that U.S. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. Trump, in turn, revived both Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. Legal challenges followed and in November 2018 a federal judge halted construction on Keystone XL and ordered the Trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. Trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company TransCanada to again proceed with construction.\n\nIf built, the planned 1,179-mile, $8.5 billion Keystone XL pipeline would transport some 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, where it would link up with the existing Keystone pipeline that connects to refineries in Texas.\n\nPipeline owner TC Energy Corp said in a statement Wednesday that it would suspend construction ahead of Biden's order, which it called very disappointing.\n\nWhile the Trump administration, industry groups and other project supporters touted the pipeline's potential to create thousands of new jobs, environmentalists and Native American groups have long warned about its potential climate and other environmental impacts. The pipeline has already suffered a number of failures, including a nearly 400,000-gallon spill in North Dakota in October 2019.\n\nCanadian officials were among those who expressed concern this week after several media outlets reported on Biden's looming action. Jason Kenney, the premier of the province of Alberta, said in a statement that repealing the project permit would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important Canada-US relationship, and undermine US national security by making the United States more dependent on OPEC oil imports in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups hope the president's executive order is just the start of aggressive government action to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese huge first steps show Biden is serious about climate action, but re-entering the Paris Agreement and canceling Keystone must be the start of a furious race to avert catastrophe, Kierán Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. Much more is needed, and we're increasingly hopeful the administration will stop approving new fossil fuel projects and speed the transition to clean, distributed energy that climate science and justice demand.
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement resigned Wednesday, only weeks after taking over the agency that detains and deports immigrants and runs international criminal investigations.\n\nJonathan Fahey gave no explanation for his abrupt departure in a brief email to employees late in the day, telling them that Wednesday was his last day. He was replaced by Tae Johnson, currently deputy director and now the agency's fourth acting director since August.\n\nI am sincerely impressed by the professionalism and integrity with which you perform your duties each and every day, he wrote in his farewell message obtained by The Associated Press. Despite leaving your ranks, I will remain an ardent supporter of this Agency and workforce, cheering on your successes and praying for your safety.\n\nICE spokeswoman Jenny Burke confirmed Fahey had resigned and that Johnson would replace him but did answer why. BuzzFeed News first reported the resignation.\n\nICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which has also cycled through leaders during Donald Trump's presidency. Chad Wolf resigned this week as acting secretary of a department that has been without a Senate-confirmed leader since Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out in April 2019.\n\nICE, with more than 20,000 employees, oversees a sprawling network of immigration detention centers and carries out deportations. Its Homeland Security Investigations unit has a broad portfolio, including child exploitation, money laundering, antiquities theft and human smuggling.\n\nFahey's announcement surprised employees. He joined Homeland Security in March as a senior adviser for immigration policy after years as a federal and state prosecutor in Virginia.\n\nJohnson takes the reins at ICE less than a week before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

In 2003, the SARS outbreak almost ruined the Chinese communities in Canada.\n\nFrank Ye felt this first-hand. Now a 23-year-old masters student at the University of Toronto, Ye was only around eight years old when the SARS outbreak happened but he already began to encounter racism at his school.\n\nI remember when the other kid on the playground would tell me to go away because 'all Chinese people had SARS,' Ye posted on Twitter.\n\nI remember when the other kids on the playground would tell me to go away because all Chinese people had SARS, the spread of the virus is a concern, but let's not let paranoia translate to racism. My heart cries for the little Chinese kids who well face racism because of this. https://t.co/Dt5HopxD1w — Frank Ye (@Leafye_river) January 26, 2020\n\nAs a kid, I didn't understand what racism was, being in first and second grade, Ye told HuffPost Canada. But thinking back to it, when kids told me to get away from them because I was Chinese, that was racism.\n\nAt the time it made me feel excluded and made me feel invalid in who I was.\n\nWhen news of the novel coronavirus first started spreading, Asian-Canadians like Ye felt they were grappling not just with the outbreak of a new mysterious virus, but also the onslaught of racism they've come to expect.\n\nIn 2003, Toronto was hit especially hard by SARS. There were a total of 44 deaths, all in or around the city. As the toll rose, people started staying away from Chinese restaurants and grocery stores, CBC News reported in 2003. Businesses in Toronto's Chinatown reported their customers dropping by 70 to 90 per cent.\n\nCarlos Osorio / Reuters Pedestrians walk in the Chinatown district of downtown Toronto on Jan. 28, 2020.\n\nBesides the economic hit, Asian communities in Canada faced racism at personal levels. The Ontario government's post-SARS commission found cases of Chinese workers getting terminated from their jobs and Chinese tenants unlawfully kicked out by landlords. Funeral homes cancelled victims' funerals if they heard the body came from a hospital dealing with SARS.\n\nYe is worried that as the new virus makes its way through the information cycle, young kids will have to go through the same discrimination he went through.\n\nIt doesn't help that Ye has already seen an instance of blatant racism among people his own age. On a university Facebook group he's a part of, someone posted a fake graphic insinuating that people in Wuhan, China — where the outbreak reportedly started — are trying to rip masks off medical staff.\n\nI think this time around it's made so much worse by social media, where anyone can say anything they want, whether it's trying to take advantage of it for views and making these fake claims, or it's people like this who are spreading a racist message.\n\nCourtesy of Frank Ye Frank Ye is a graduate student at Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto studying public policy. He endured SARS-fuelled racism as a child.\n\nHarris Ali, a professor of sociology at York University who has written extensively about the social impact of the SARS outbreak in Toronto, said that social media is the factor that didn't exist then the same way it does now.\n\nAt the time of the SARS outbreak, cellphones and texting were still at a rudimentary phase. But now, social media has given people the ability to gather virtually — and it's helping to amplify existing prejudice.\n\nIn Ontario, thousands of parents in the York Region signed a petition asking the school board to keep students whose family had visited China away from schools. The school's chair wrote back to parents, letting them know the request ran the risk of demonstrating bias and racism.\n\nThat sort of response, you didn't get it in the 2003 outbreak, said Ali. The racism responses were more interpersonal and individualized — shunning on the street, hate messages on telephone answering machines, Canadian-Chinese community centres facing verbal abuse.\n\nWatch: Coronavirus: the myths you shouldn't believe. Story continues below.\n\nWhile those responses were unwarranted and irresponsible, Ali says that the anonymity of the web means those responses can happen faster than ever.\n\nIt has an enduring psychological impact, he said.\n\nAli said that the obvious difference with the novel coronavirus outbreak is that things have improved technically — Canada was prepared to handle the virus before it even came here, the technology is more advanced, and health officials were able to mobilize quicker.\n\nWhere the improvement has not occured is with the social impact of the disease — racism, stigmatization — those have kind of been left unaddressed, he said.\n\nIn 2003, paranoia surrounding SARS reached such heights that Jean Chrétien, prime minister at the time, went to a restaurant in Chinatown and publicly ate soup, in an effort to ease fears.\n\nFred Lum/ Globe and Mail/ The Canadian Press Jean Chrétien has tea with members of Toronto's Chinese community in response to SARS fears which hurt Chinese businesses, on Apr. 10, 2003.\n\nIt's a good gesture of solidarity, it's a good gesture against the racist presumption, said Justin Kong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council.\n\nRegardless, people should not assume that just because you're going to a Chinese restaurant or Chinese mall, that means that somehow you're going to get infected.\n\nKong said when news of the novel virus hit Canada, there was already an impending sense of fear in the Chinese-Canadian community that they'd experience what they went through with SARS.\n\nIt didn't take long before his fears were validated. For example, Kong came across a tweet by CTV reporter Peter Akman that showed him posing beside his barber who was wearing a face mask.\n\nHopefully ALL I got today was a haircut, Akman captioned the photo. He since apologized for the tweet.\n\nBut Kong said the damage was already done.\n\nThat was just a regular person who was working, small-business owner, probably just gave this guy a haircut, he said. The only basis of that was because this person was Chinese and that they were wearing a mask.\n\nAs part of the national council, Kong is working to help monitor misinformation about the disease and help keep the media on track. Seeing a journalist from an established outlet engage in racism was not a good start.\n\nI think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in China, anyone is susceptible to the virus.\n\nKong described the community paranoia among Asian-Canadians ⁠— the fear that racist attitudes toward them will come to the forefront ⁠— as a hallmark of every time a disease breaks out.\n\nI think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in China, anyone is susceptible to the virus. - Justin Kong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council\n\nBut it's not unwarranted. Ye is feeling the impact of it on his day-to-day life.\n\nIt's just the worry that someone says something or looks at you some way and you feel it's because of this virus, or people are avoiding you because of who you are.\n\nAfter bearing the brunt of the social and economic impact of SARS in 2003, Chinese-Canadians were left to rebuild their lives by themselves. The Asian Canadian Labour Alliance noted in their post-SARS report that though the government had put aside $150 million to help Ontario recover from SARS, not a single cent went to Chinatown businesses or workers.\n\nKong thinks that, going forward, it's all about balancing a needed policy-based response and not producing unjustified hyper-fear. Even within the community, he said, fears are fluctuating between Oh, I'm so scared to this is no big deal.\n\nYou carry this burden where you worry about yourself, but you also worry about the well-being of your relatives who are in a worse situation than you are right now in Canada, said Ye.\n\nCole Burston via Getty Images Health officials during a press briefing on the coronavirus at Queen's Park on Jan. 27, 2020, in Toronto.\n\nCanada should start considering how to properly deal with the social impacts of outbreaks, Ali said, especially given that with globalization, they're more likely.\n\nWhen I interviewed the guy who discovered SARS, he said, 'You know what's different today? In the past you would have a disease outbreak in a village, and it was very limited because it used to burn itself out.'\n\nAmongst the vitriol against Chinese communities in North America, some people like to point to SARS and other diseases as proof that China is a hotbed of diseases.\n\nThat's nonsense, said Ali. If you study infectious disease and their origins, they all have their origins in an animal reservoir. He said given the increasing rate of globalization, disease can come from livestock here as well.\n\nAli says outbreaks are going to keep on happening, just because of the way we live.\n\nI'm not passing judgment on that at all, it's just sort of a natural thing.\n\nWith the likelihood that this will happen again, social and psychological factors of outbreaks should be considered as important as the technical issues — but they're not, Ali said.
The sight of McDonald's workers walking off the job in protest has been a public-relations nightmare for the company during the past three years. Now a judge will determine whether the fast-food giant broke labor law as it tried to protect its image and quell the strikes.\n\nMcDonald's goes on trial at the National Labor Relations Board in New York City on Monday. The proceedings will set out to answer two fundamental questions: Should McDonald's be considered an employer alongside the franchisees who run its stores, and if so, did the company violate its employees' rights amid the mass protests?\n\nThe hearings are about much more than a few one-day strikes. In a sense, the very franchise model that McDonald's and most other fast-food companies operate on will be on trial.\n\nMcDonald's sets the terms and conditions for its employees -- in this case we'll make that clear, Gwynne Wilcox, an attorney for the fast-food workers, said on a call with reporters Thursday. The company dictates policy and practice. Workers have been intimidated and threatened and even fired.\n\nWhile McDonald's did not immediately comment on Thursday, the company has told The Huffington Post in the past that it views the NLRB case as an overreach that strike[s] at the heart of the franchise system. McDonald's denies that it broke the law.\n\nThe case is being brought by the NLRB's general counsel, on behalf of McDonald's workers who are part of the union-backed Fight for $15 movement. The workers claim they were retaliated against for their activism, which embarrassed the company and helped draw national attention to the plight of low-wage workers. The trial involves so-called unfair labor practice charges involving McDonald's locations scattered around the country.\n\nIt isn't often that a franchisor like McDonald's is held accountable for labor law violations at its stores. Roughly 90 percent of McDonald's locations are technically run by franchisees -- the much smaller companies or individuals who tend to the day-to-day operations and ultimately sign workers' paychecks. According to McDonald's, it's the franchisee who's responsible for the working conditions inside a McDonald's store.\n\nThe Fight for $15, which is funded by the Service Employees International Union, has challenged that entire premise. It argues that McDonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs. The franchise model, it says, merely helps the company shirk its duties to workers, by shifting legal liabilities onto franchisees when workers get shorted on pay or fired for union activism.\n\nIf they succeed at trial and prove that McDonald's has a significant hand in setting the working conditions, then McDonald's could be punished for violating the workers' rights. The fast-food company would find itself answering to workers at franchised stores in a way it never had to before.\n\nThe general counsel's case has put the entire franchise industry on notice. The International Franchise Association, a trade lobby, has led a publicity blitz against the board, claiming it threatens businesses and entire industries if it deems companies like McDonald's joint employers. Republicans in Congress have publicized their cause, holding hearings and pushing legislation that would block the board from moving forward with such cases.\n\nFor its own part, McDonald's fought subpoenas from the board for records related to its business practices, forcing the NLRB to go to federal court. McDonald's and its franchisees were eventually compelled to fork over the documents.\n\nIn a call with reporters Thursday, David Dean, another lawyer for the fast-food workers, accused McDonald's of intentionally delaying the trial and doing everything they can to drag out the proceedings.\n\nMcDonald's seems resolved to try this case in the dark if it can, Dean said.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nPHOTO GALLERY McDonald's Secret Menu
stevendelduca.ca Ontario Liberal leadership candidate Steven Del Duca says his daughters, who are 8 and 12, motivate him to do something about climate change.\n\nTORONTO — Ontario businesses had spent $3 billion on permits to pollute under cap and trade when Premier Doug Ford started dismantling the program, five days into his mandate. Then, for about five months, Ontario had no price on pollution, until the federal government's carbon tax came into effect.\n\nThis whipsaw effect is confusing for voters and businesses and sabotages climate action in the long run, says Ontario Liberal leadership contender Steven Del Duca. That's why he says — if he wins the leadership convention and the next election — his government would collaborate on climate policy with opposition parties.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives and NDP would have a hard time attacking and taking apart programs they helped develop, he said.\n\nWhen you're facing that kind of a threat, it shouldn't become a partisan political football. And that's what it's become, the former cabinet minister told HuffPost Canada.\n\nMark Blinch/Canadian Press Former Ontario minister Steven Del Duca stands with then-premier Kathleen Wynne at a climate announcement in Toronto on June 8, 2016.\n\nDespite the fact that Ontario's Liberal party has no permanent leader and only six elected members, it has more support than Ford's PCs, according to recent polls.\n\nThat means Del Duca, who's considered the front-runner to replace Kathleen Wynne, has a real shot at becoming premier in the 2022 election.\n\nHe gave HuffPost an exclusive preview of his Multi-Party Climate Change Plan.\n\nIt includes seven measures:\n\nCreate a committee with at least one MPP from every party in the legislature to work on climate policy,\n\nBring back reimbursements for electric vehicle purchases,\n\nMatch federal funding to build infrastructure for electric vehicles like charging stations,\n\nPlant 800 million trees in 10 years,\n\nGive a 50 per cent discount on fares to public transit riders on weekends, holidays and outside one-hour peaks on weekdays,\n\nGive $100 million a year to municipalities, businesses and farmers to build infrastructure that can stand up to extreme weather,\n\nDevelop a climate change curriculum for elementary and high school students.\n\nOntario needs a policy that is real, tangible and produces positive results, he said.\n\nRight now, all of those things are absent from the decisions that we see being made at Queen's Park by Doug Ford and his friends.\n\nIt's been particularly horrible to see Ford's government revoke Liberal environmental policies because they haven't replaced them with anything significant, Del Duca said.\n\nFord's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but Ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. Environment Minister Jeff Yurek has since called the plan a draft.\n\nEarlier: Premier Doug Ford defends climate plan. Story continues after video.\n\nOntario's emissions have been falling since the mid-2000s, largely because the Liberals phased out coal plants. Wynne, who still sits in the legislature as an MPP, sometimes shouts, You're welcome, when PCs say Ontario has cut its emissions.\n\nThe province needs to cut emissions from non-electricity sectors to meet future targets, according to a report by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, an independent office that was cut by Ford's government.\n\nMost of the measures in Del Duca's plan go after the largest source of Ontario's emissions: transportation.\n\nThe transit discount, which would apply in any jurisdiction that has public transit, would take cars off the road, he said.\n\nThere will be a whole bunch of new riders who come into the system if they leave their car at home, which is really good news for climate change.\n\nDel Duca says he would start implementing the plan within 100 days of winning office. Three of its measures — funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, rebates for electric vehicles and discounts for public transit — would be introduced no later than the government's spring budget in 2023.\n\nDel Duca couldn't project how many emissions his plan would cut, but said he'd align himself with the federal Liberals' goal to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. And he hasn't worked out how much the plan would cost.\n\nThe bigger question for us as a province is: What are we prepared to do? What are we prepared to invest in order to make sure that my daughters and the millions of others like them ... actually have a sustainable future? he said.\n\nFrom that perspective, I think it's more important for us … to make these kinds of investments and get the job done.
By Wayne Karl\n\nSpring has sprung, and while spring season is normally an occasion to celebrate, with days growing longer, weather getting warmer and real estate heading into busy season, everything feels a little different this year.\n\nCanada's real estate markets are dealing with myriad of issues. In the Toronto area, it's an acute supply shortage, skyrocketing prices and a resulting affordability crisis.\n\nIn B.C., a compositional shift towards softer sales and slowing price growth.\n\nIn Alberta, it's all about recovery, as the province and housing sectors claw their way out of two or three years of economic quagmire.\n\nOther provinces are dealing with their own economic- and market-specific challenges and opportunities.\n\nIn the resource-intensive provinces of Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, sales activity is still running at lower levels and supply is elevated. This has resulted in weakened price trends for these provinces, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).\n\nIn Ontario's Greater Golden Horseshoe (the GTA, Hamilton-Burlington, Oakville-Milton, Guelph, Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, the Niagara Region, Barrie and nearby cottage country), the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly tight. This is expected to lead to continued double-digit price growth, resulting in further erosion in affordability and sales activity in the absence of a significant and sustained rise in new supply, CREA says.\n\nPRESSURE ON POLICY\n\nAgainst this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. In Ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the Ontario Home Builders' Association, Ontario Real Estate Association, and the Building Industry and Land Development Association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. And to speed up the approvals process.\n\nThe Canadian Home Builders' Association (CHBA) is also growing more vocal. In early March, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. The Housing Supply Deficit - Not Enough Homes for Families with Young Children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. The report notes that if current trends continue, Canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade.\n\nThere has been a lot of commentary around what's driving house prices in markets like Vancouver and the GTA, says CHBA CEO Kevin Lee. Much of this overlooks the fundamental factors of supply and demand, and the increasing number of young families trying to achieve homeownership.\n\nFOREIGN BUYERS\n\nIn Toronto, having seen how effective a foreign buyers' tax in Vancouver has been to cooling a potentially overheating market there, the City is said to be considering taking similar action. Something... anything might be better than to let double-digit price growth continue unchecked, proponents say.\n\nBut, critics argue, slapping a tax on foreign purchases is short-sighted and will do nothing to facilitate a long-term solution to increase the supply of new homes.\n\nIf all of this wasn't complex enough, add the prospect of the National Housing Strategy. Due out at some point this year, this federal initiative will attempt to address the varied and challenging issues, involving differing provincial and regional economies, housing markets and conditions, from affordable housing to rental markets to homeownership.\n\nBUDGET 2017\n\nUntil then, we were looking to the 2017 federal budget, tabled on March 22 to see what, if anything, Ottawa would include to begin tackling some of these challenges. At the very least, it would have been reasonable to expect some modernization of the existing Home Buyers' Plan to allow Canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty. Many thought such changes would be included in Budget 2016, but none were forthcoming.\n\nBudget 2017, while making housing a priority by proposing to invest more than $11.2 billion over 11 years in a variety of initiatives, still comes up short on addressing affordability for first-time buyers.\n\nThe housing-related allocations in this budget are principally for affordable/social housing, so the key challenge of affordability for market-rate housing, and especially for first-time homebuyers, remains an issue, CHBA's Lee told YPNextHome.\n\nOriginally published on YPNextHome.ca\n\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook
Christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that President Barack Obama helped spur destructive Black Lives Matter protests, that the Democrats' choice of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that President Donald Trump is the fighter Republicans want, a HuffPost analysis has found.\n\nThe analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of Christian educational materials ― Abeka and BJU Press ― looked at how the books teach the Trump era of politics. We found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative Christian policies. Language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of Christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.\n\nScholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on Christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of Christian nationalism. Before storming the Capitol, some groups prayed in the name of Jesus and asked for divine protection. They flew Christian and Jesus 2020 flags and pointed to Trump's presidency as the will of God. The linkage between Christian beliefs and the violent attack on Congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with Trump and their support for the rioters.\n\nThese textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said Kathleen Wellman, a Southern Methodist University history professor who is working on a book about the two Christian publishers. I'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.\n\nRepresentatives from BJU Press and Abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. However, a 2017 HuffPost investigation found that about one-third of Christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called Accelerated Christian Education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. The number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (Voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)\n\nA passage in a history textbook published by Abeka.\n\nBoth Abeka and BJU Press have ties to Christian colleges. Abeka was launched in the 1970s by Arlin and Beka Horton, who also founded Pensacola Christian College, a Florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. BJU Press is affiliated with the evangelical Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.\n\nWe unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, Amy Yohe, managing editor of Abeka Publishing, told HuffPost. One of Abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative.\n\nBJU Press did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, scholars who study religion in America say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. Christian nationalists argue that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and has a special covenant with God, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with God. The textbooks parrot these ideas, said Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the Association of Religion Data Archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n\nAs we see in these textbooks, they're afraid of outside forces or the U.S. won't be what it should be, said Whitehead. There's always a particular prescription ― they have to be on God's good side. I think that's a big part of it.\n\nPassages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which America is constantly moving away from a moral center, with Christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.\n\nOne passage in an 11th-grade U.S. history textbook from Abeka states, Although many false philosophies were popular in America before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … Three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism.\n\nBelieving religion — particularly Christianity — to be divisive, globalists discourage its influence on public life, it continues.\n\nBy parroting such conservative political views under the guise of Christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. While all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with Trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nObviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said Adam Laats, professor of history and education at New York state's Binghamton University. There's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.\n\nHuffPost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize Nelson Mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive South Africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that Satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. Many of the schools that use these books also ban LGBTQ students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. At one point in an Abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.\n\nI absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, Wellman said. It's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of Christianity with military culture.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images Trump supporters gather near the east front door of the U.S. Capitol after groups breached the building's security on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhen discussing protests against the Iraq War and President George W. Bush's low approval rating at the time, the Abeka 11th-grade U.S. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in America was the media, supported by a large number of Hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many Americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.\n\nWhen discussing President Obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. Below is a passage from that Abeka history book:\n\nMany Americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that Obama was inaugurated. Unfortunately, Americans' views of race relations declined after Obama came into office. Race riots in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. President Obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.\n\nThe books do not mention that such protests came in response to the deaths of unarmed Black men, including Michael Brown and Freddie Gray Jr., at the hands of police.\n\nA high-school-level textbook from BJU Press also blames the Black Lives Matter movement for racial discord. It says:\n\nDespite President Obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. Several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. Groups such as Black Lives Matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. Mixed messages from the Obama administration, the Department of Justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.\n\nThe textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes Black Lives Matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. The book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the Obama administration were.\n\nOther targets of the textbooks include globalists, environmentalists and multiculturalists.\n\nAccording to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. They encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and God, reads the Abeka American history textbook. However, many conservatives and Christians within America have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn America into a united, moral nation.\n\nThe textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of Trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of Christians who is fighting for their values. One description from the Abeka textbook reads:\n\nContrary to the high hopes that Obama's presidency would bring the country together, Americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. The Democratic Party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. Republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the Democrats. ... The Republican Party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump from New York, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave Republicans the fighter they wanted. As a businessman, Trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the United States and make it great again.' However, many conservatives were wary of Trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by Trump's choice for his running mate — Indiana's conservative governor Mike Pence.\n\nEvangelical Christians were one of Trump's most important voting blocks. Though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the Associated Press. About 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians voted for Trump last year.\n\nA passage from an Abeka high school history book.\n\nImages from the Capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old Mel Garman, who grew up attending evangelical Christian schools.\n\nThere were the Christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside American flags. The rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of God, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white Christian supremacy. Last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. She felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.\n\nOver the course of my life I can see how what I was taught in Christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on Jan. 6 played into it. That whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said Garman, who is now a social worker. It's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.\n\nSince Jan. 6, popular pro-Trump evangelical leaders have felt driven to judge the rioters' actions, with some offering full-throttle condemnations and others issuing more temperate responses.\n\nThe Secret Service had to escort the vice president of the United States to safety out of the Capitol building. Gunshots were fired. Tear gas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda. People were killed. ... This was an assault on law. Attacking the Capitol was not patriotism; it was anarchy, said Rev. John Hagee of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio during his Sunday sermon, before going on to rally support for law enforcement, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMiles away in Kentucky, Brian Gibson, pastor and founder of His Church, blamed the riot on antifa agitators, a conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence.\n\nYou don't get 2 million people together without having some radicals in the crowd or some simple people in the crowd that you could lead anywhere, right? he said, also greatly exaggerating the size of the crowd that day.\n\nIn other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on Christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. In Chicago, high school teacher Raven Althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are Black.\n\nThey think of when they had Black Lives Matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. People are literally storming the Capitol and nothing is happening to them, Althimer told HuffPost. One of my students said, 'If 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' I said, 'No, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'

President-elect Donald Trump's transition landing teams have begun to descend on federal agencies across the government. These men and women are charged with providing the new administration information about the responsibilities of the various agencies as well as the challenges ahead.\n\nFor federal employees, this can be an unsettling time with many unknowns that include probable policy changes and new personalities calling the shots. But it also can be an opportunity for career executives to lay the groundwork for productive working relationships with the new team.\n\nThere is no magic formula. It is really about career executives providing the transition team members with useful information, offering the best possible insights and meeting their requests whenever possible.\n\nEdward Hugler, the deputy assistant secretary for operations at the Department of Labor and a veteran of presidential transitions, advises that managers who confer with the transition landing teams should anticipate and be prepared to give them what they need without trying to provide every detail of the department or agency handbook. More often than not, he added, they will tell you what they want.\n\nThis post was originally featured on The Washington Post's website.
loujainhathloul Fahad Albutairi (left) is a popular Saudi comedian. Loujain Hathloul (right) is a prominent women's rights activist in Saudi Arabia. Both have been harassed by the Saudi government.\n\nA TV producer's Twitter thread is going viral after he called on lawmakers to come to the aid of two well-known activist friends who have been arrested amid Saudi Arabia's ruthless crackdown on dissidents.\n\nKirk Rudell, whose producing credits include American Dad! and Will & Grace, drew attention to the plight of women's rights activist Loujain Hathloul and comedian Fahad Albutairi in a Twitter thread Wednesday. Both were reportedly arrested last year, and Hathloul remains in detention. Albutairi's status was not immediately known.\n\nRudell called on the U.S. government to stop accepting payoffs to look the other way at human rights atrocities committed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Hathloul's detention has been widely reported for months, Rudell's disturbing Twitter thread ― an excerpt of which is included below ― propelled her story back into the spotlight this week. His post follows the high-profile killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who had criticized the country's royal family.\n\nRudell tweeted that he first met Albutairi, dubbed the Seinfeld of Saudi Arabia, and his then-wife Hathloul a couple years ago during a recording session for Fox's American Dad! Rudell is a co-executive producer and has written for the animated TV series. Albutairi voiced a minor character in a 2017 episode of the show, according to IMDb.\n\nHathloul, who rose to prominence for defying Saudi Arabia's ban on women drivers, and Albutairi continued to keep in touch with Rudell over the years, the TV writer said. But Rudell wrote that his communication with them ceased after they were allegedly detained by Saudi officials in March 2018.\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain, Rudell tweeted.\n\nRudell urged high-profile figures like Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, as well as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and the newly Democratic-led House of Representatives, to focus on Albutairi and Hathloul.\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff, Rudell wrote.\n\nNeither Rudell nor a representative for the Saudi government immediately responded to HuffPost's requests for comment. HuffPost's email to Albutairi was not returned.\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy MbS was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain.\n\n\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff. pic.twitter.com/V14KV8USHs — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nHathloul was jailed for 73 days in 2014 after driving her car from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, where she lived. She has been arrested several times since then for protesting Saudi Arabia's male guardianship laws and ban on women drivers.\n\nMohammed bin Salman became publicly associated with the government's decision to lift the ban by permitting women to apply for driver's licenses, which was announced just a few months after he gained new power by becoming crown prince in the summer of 2017.\n\nSome world leaders saw the move as a signal that the crown price would herald in a more progressive era for the Middle Eastern kingdom. But the infamous killing of Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded had been ordered by the crown prince, sent shockwaves through the region.\n\nHathloul and Albutair were reportedly detained by the Saudi government in March 2018. She was released, but ultimately detained again in May 2018, along with several other Saudi women's rights activists.\n\nShe is being held in the country's notorious maximum-security Dhahban Prison, according to Amnesty International. She has not been formally charged.\n\n[Hathloul] appears to have been targeted as punishment for standing up for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, Sara Hashash, Amnesty International's media manager for the Middle East and North Africa, told HuffPost in a statement.\n\nInstead of detaining her for months without charge the Saudi Arabian authorities should release her and all other women human rights defenders detained in connection with their peaceful activism immediately and unconditionally, she added.\n\nAmnesty International reported in November 2018 that activists detained at Dhahban Prison had been subjected to torture and sexual harassment.\n\nAlbutairi was reportedly arrested in March 2018 while working on an acting project in Jordan. He was handcuffed, blindfolded and flown to Saudi Arabia, The New York Times reported. It's unclear if he has been released. His Twitter and Instagram pages have been deleted.\n\nThe Times reported in October that Hathloul and Albutairi's marriage had ended, though it's unclear why or when this happened.\n\nSome Twitter users warned that Rudell's decision to include screenshots of alleged conversations he had with Hathloul could pose a risk to the jailed activist.\n\nI question how wise it is to display what are obviously private screenshots from someone who is currently being detained, tweeted H.A. Hellyer, a Middle Eastern policy and security expert. Surely these could be very easily used against the detainee?\n\nUnpopular opinion: this thread is mostly good, but maybe, just maybe, there was no reason to share screenshots of texts from a now-jailed activist. What purpose does showing Lujain asking for help/feedback serve? 🤔 https://t.co/EnCB0UOcXQ — مريم (@MaryamSaleh) January 3, 2019\n\nI understand what @krudell is trying to accomplish here. But, like @MaryamSaleh, I question how wise it is to display what are obviously private screenshots from someone who is currently being detained. Surely these could be very easily used against the detainee? https://t.co/mEnftJvcmJ — Dr H.A. Hellyer (@hahellyer) January 3, 2019\n\nRead an excerpt of Rudell's Twitter thread below:\n\nA couple years ago, when I was writing for American Dad!, I needed an Arabic speaker for a small part. Our casting director recommended a Saudi comedian, who happened to be in LA for a couple months shooting a tv show. His name is Fahad Albutairi. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI looked him up. He was the first Saudi stand-up comedian to appear on stage professionally in the Kingdom, the Jerry Seinfeld of Saudi Arabia. He had a couple million Twitter followers. (He has none now; I'll get to that.) He was, frankly, more interesting than the part. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThe day of the recording, I walked to the booth to meet Fahad and direct his session – it was just a couple lines; I'd say hi, run it a few times, and we'd both be on our way.\n\n\n\nFahad was standing with a woman, who he introduced as his wife, @LoujainHathloul. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nLoujain didn't know anyone in LA, so she was tagging along with Fahad for the day. They were young, cool, cosmopolitan, and incredibly nice. I liked them right away. We chatted. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI asked Fahad about being a Saudi comedian – about doing something that didn't exist before in his country. I had recently had breakfast with Trevor Noah to talk about a project, and it seemed like he was coming from a similar place... — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\n...growing up without hearing other stand-ups and being unfamiliar with the standard rhythms. So Trevor had to create his own. Fahad was fascinated. Yes, he had had a similar experience. But his voice was also shaped by the fact that comedy in the Kingdom was...dangerous. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nSo now we dipped into politics.\n\n\n\nI mentioned the young, progressive Prince Mohammed bin Salman. All the press in the US seemed pretty positive about the guy. He was meeting people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Were they feeling optimistic about the future of Saudi Arabia? — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey were hopeful but warned there was still a long way to go on human rights. Which is why they'd moved to the UAE.\n\n\n\nHuh. At least you're safe, I said. With millions of fans, he was too high profile to mess with. I looked at Loujain. And his fame covers both of you, right? — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey looked at each other. She's much more famous than me in the Middle East, he said. And then I realized who she was... one of the women's rights activists who had been arrested for driving. https://t.co/iCbPte9cwe — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI felt like an idiot. I had assumed she was the sidekick when she had already, by her mid-20s, done more for human rights than I ever will. https://t.co/CBGPYzdJJT — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nWe talked about her arrests. The toll it had taken when, just after their wedding, she had been picked up again and disappeared for a few days. They felt somewhat protected by their fame, but still... the Kingdom wasn't safe. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey were a window into a world I only knew through small articles in the Times, and I could've talked to them all afternoon, but we had to do the record and get on with our days.\n\n\n\nWe exchanged info. We made plans to have dinner while they were in town. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nFahad and I sent each other links to work we were doing...trying to make the gulf between our worlds a little bit smaller. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nIn 2017 I read that Loujain was arrested and reached out to Fahad to see if she was okay. He answered that she was already being released. It was scary but fine.\n\n\n\nAnd then, last spring, they were both grabbed, blindfolded, and taken to Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/PWvLLFW5HD — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy MbS was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain.\n\n\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff. pic.twitter.com/V14KV8USHs — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nNine months later, Loujain is still in jail. I don't know where Fahad is. He deactivated his Twitter.\n\n\n\nI read that they are no longer married. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI'd like to see what they could do in this world, if they were given the chance.\n\n\n\nI'd like the government of my country to not take payoffs to look the other way at human rights atrocities.\n\n\n\nI'd like to have that dinner with them some day. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nAs the Democrats take control of the House, I'd like my fantastic @RepAdamSchiff to have Fahad and Loujain in his thoughts.\n\n\n\nMaybe @Trevornoah can give them some of his attention, too – I know they admired him. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nAkbar Shahid Ahmed contributed reporting.
Jake Paul/YouTube Jake Paul posted the Mystery Brand-sponsored video I Spent $5,000 ON MYSTERY BOXES & You WONT Believe WHAT I GOT... (insane) on his channel.\n\nYouTube's top influencers have cashed in on highly lucrative sponsorship deals to promote an online gambling company to their young fans, and YouTube doesn't have a problem with it.\n\nIn recent weeks, celebrity YouTubers Jake Paul, Bryan RiceGum Le and others have faced fierce backlash after uploading videos to their wildly popular channels featuring MysteryBrand.net, a website that lets users pay for a chance to win a variety of prizes.\n\nPeople who are 13 or older can sign up on MysteryBrand.net to buy virtual mystery boxes, which range in price from $1.99 to more than $1,299.99, and are marketed to contain an item from brands including Apple, Ralph Lauren, Xbox, Gucci, Supreme, Nike and Rolex. After paying for a box, users can open it on-screen to reveal their prize, then either order the item for delivery or sell it back (typically at a much lower price than the cost of the box) to receive online credit and try again. They can also select prizes to create their own box with customized odds, which tend to be far more expensive. Little information about Mystery Brand is publicly available, though the website states its terms and conditions are subject to Polish laws.\n\nYou could get a pile of shit or you could get a Rolls-Royce, 21-year-old Paul, YouTube's second-highest-paid star, told his 17.7 million subscribers in a recent video sponsored by Mystery Brand. I want you guys to go to MysteryBrand.net right now and play this game and tell me or tweet me or something if you guys win this, OK? urged Paul, who said in 2018 that his YouTube audience is primarily comprised of 8- to 16-year-old kids.\n\nMysteryBrand.net Top prizes listed on MysteryBrand.net include a $173,691.36 Louis Vuitton trunk.\n\n'It's Just A Scam'\n\nMysteryBrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium California real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of Paul and Le's viral videos. Its now-deleted photo of a $250 million Most Expensive Los Angeles Realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million Bel Air home, The Daily Beast and others reported. And until recently, Mystery Brand's prize list included a 2018 Lamborghini Centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). The same goes for its Real Car Rolls-Royce Phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.\n\nAfter people called the website out on Twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. Angry reviews on Reddit and Mystery Brand's Facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. Critics, including controversial Swedish YouTube influencer PewDiePie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-Semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: In their promotional posts, Paul and Le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their Mystery Brand videos. Le quickly won an $11,000 Chanel purse which, according to odds listed on MysteryBrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.\n\nMystery Brand is like gambling. It was very addictive. Ian Yael, 21, a YouTuber and former Mystery Brand user\n\nIan Yael, a 21-year-old university student from Mexico City, spent hundreds of dollars and opened nearly 20 boxes on MysteryBrand.net before winning a $1,100 Louis Vuitton pocket knife and ordering it for delivery in mid-October. But three months later, the item has not even been processed for shipping, his account shows.\n\nMystery Brand is like gambling. It was very addictive, Yael said. But it's just a scam. In messages viewed by HuffPost, he contacted the website several times to request an update or refund. A representative who goes by the name Tim Perk repeatedly assured Yael, month after month, Everything regarding your order is fine, and [it] should be coming soon!\n\nMysteryBrand.net courtesy of Ian Yael Ian Yael ordered his Mystery Brand prize for delivery on Oct. 14, as shown above. It still hasn't shipped.\n\nIn the U.S., gambling is generally defined as paying to place a bet or wager to win a lottery or other prize, and is restricted for minors. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that internet gambling on a game of chance is not prohibited by law, however the Justice Department maintains that all internet gambling by parties in the U.S. is illegal. Within the European Union, there is no broad policy on gambling regulation, so each member state enforces its own laws.\n\nPerk claimed in an emailed statement to HuffPost that the site isn't a scam and its service is not equatable to gambling because other companies sell packages with unknown contents, too.\n\nMystery Brand is not much different from those projects, except for the fact that we make the whole process of buying and receiving items from a Mystery Box fast and transparent in real time, said Perk. He added: Sometimes, shipping may take up to a couple of weeks since we mostly use the [online marketplace] StockX platform for purchasing and delivering prizes.\n\nStockX was completely unaware of MysteryBrand.net, a representative told The Verge, adding that no formal partnership between the companies exists. Digital marketplace G2A cut ties with the website last week amid the scam and gambling allegations.\n\nMarco and Alvin/YouTube Mystery Brand videos have gone viral on YouTube.\n\nYouTube Unbothered\n\nYael, who spends several hours per day on YouTube, said he learned about MysteryBrand.net from trending videos on Marco and Alvin, a popular YouTube channel that has featured the website dozens of times since early October. The videos are supposedly unsponsored, but still profit from ad revenue through YouTube's general monetization program.\n\nYouTube's community guidelines claim the Google-owned company is constantly working to keep YouTube free of spam, scams, and other deceptive practices that attempt to take advantage of the YouTube community. But the video giant declined to answer why it allows monetized videos promoting a shady gambling website on channels geared to kids and teens.\n\nCreators should be transparent with their audiences if their content includes paid promotion of any kind, a Google spokesperson told HuffPost, without addressing specific questions about Mystery Brand videos.\n\nHuffPost confirmed that YouTube's algorithm has promoted Mystery Brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both Google and the content creators. As the hosts of Marco and Alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: We were nothing before Mystery Brand. We were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first Mystery Brand video, they said. Through Mystery Brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing YouTube for a living. They now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.\n\nPaul and Le respectively pulled in around 2 million and 2.6 million views on their promotional Mystery Brand YouTube videos in one week. Content creators can earn an estimated rate of up to $5 per 1,000 views on the platform from ads. After coming under fire, Paul addressed the controversy in a pair of snarky tweets last week before reminding children not to gamble. Le filmed a subsequent video acknowledging he was somewhat in the wrong for doing business with Mystery Brand, lamenting other YouTubers had done the same in the past without major scrutiny, and complaining the ordeal had been blown out of proportion. Neither Paul nor Le responded to HuffPost's requests for comment.\n\nRiceGum/YouTube Bryan RiceGum Le posted the Mystery Brand-sponsored video How I Got AirPods For $4 on his channel.\n\n'Imagine How Much They Offered Me'\n\nYouTube stars have made big money directly through Mystery Brand sponsorship deals. Daniel Keemstar Keem, a YouTuber with 4.7 million subscribers, claimed he declined a $100,000 offer from a similar company to promote its service on his channel. Le, who has 10.8 million subscribers, suggested Mystery Brand paid him well above that amount for his sponsored video.\n\nApparently they only offered Keemstar $100K. My [subscriber] numbers are higher, so imagine how much they offered me, Le said in his apparent apology post, attempting to explain why he had agreed to do the promotion. The money was on the table and if I wanted the money I just had to open up a few Supreme boxes and shoe boxes and boom, I get the money. So I'm like, 'Yo, that sounds easy enough.'\n\nYeezy Busta, a YouTube influencer with 448,000 subscribers who asked not to use his real name for privacy reasons, confirmed to HuffPost that Perk from Mystery Brand offered him a sponsorship deal for tens of thousands of dollars in July. After doing some research into the website and deciding it was a scam, he turned it down.\n\nIt was hard to say no to the money, but I felt like in my position it was better for me to save hundreds if not thousands of people from losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars, he said. It really hurts me to see so many kids losing their money. A hundred dollars to me or to other creators isn't a whole lot, but to these kids it might be their savings or their holiday money.\n\nContent creators should do their due diligence and take responsibility for what they promote, he added. Every YouTube creator wants to influence their fans in a positive way, but sometimes a check can change people's minds.
Hoptocopter via Getty Images Even if oil demand and prices increase post-pandemic, many of the industry's lost jobs are unlikely to come back.\n\nEvery time a politician talks about climate policy or a newspaper runs a big story on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the question of jobs comes up. For those who are opposed to the transition, the common criticism is that moving away from coal, oil and gas would leave hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. For those in favor, the question is how to train hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers for different sorts of jobs.\n\nRarely do the talking points — or the debates that follow — get into the details of what's actually happening in the oil and gas labor market: that it's an industry already grappling with a dwindling talent pipeline and that a push toward automation was making tens of thousands of oil workers redundant even before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out more jobs.\n\nThe industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between March and August 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and consulting firm Deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). Even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said Ken Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nThat's because it's not just the pandemic that's hurting the industry. Other factors are cutting down the oil and gas workforce as well.\n\nFirst, as with most industries, there's automation, which has reduced the number of jobs available in the energy sector over the last several years. When oil prices crashed in 2014, the Houston area shed some 86,000 oil and gas jobs and by 2019 had regained only 24,400 of those jobs. Why? In large part because in the wake of the crash, oil companies became more efficient and began to embrace automation in a big way.\n\nThe automation trend has continued, Medlock said. So when production grew again from 2017 to 2019, that growth didn't require a lot of additional labor input.\n\nThrow global trends toward electrification and clean energy into the mix and the job market wasn't looking that rosy for oil and gas even before the pandemic.\n\nIf you're a 30-year-old graduating with an MBA and you want to stay in Houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago. Jeff Bishop, CEO of Key Capture Energy\n\nAnd even if the job demand does rebound to any extent, between policy and economic shifts and dwindling social approval of the industry, oil companies may find themselves struggling to hire.\n\nAs fossil fuels flag, all signs point to a strong future for renewable energy.\n\nLooking at global investments in the energy space, it's all going to wind, solar, batteries, EVs [electrical vehicles]. It's not going into fossil fuels, said Jeff Bishop, CEO of the large-scale battery company Key Capture Energy. Fossil fuels aren't going away, don't get me wrong, especially not in Texas. But if you're a 30-year-old graduating with an MBA and you want to stay in Houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago.\n\nLast week — a century ago by 2021 standards — social media lit up with various opinions about a New York Times story that highlighted the waning fortunes of new college graduates looking to work in the oil and gas industry. Some sympathized with young people graduating into a pandemic, but most wondered why they had chosen to work in the industry in the first place, given what we know about both its impact on climate change and its financial prospects in years to come.\n\nBut actually, Bishop and Medlock believe the changing energy landscape is not such a big problem for the sorts of white-collar workers profiled by the Times, whose skills are largely transferable to any segment of the energy sector. In fact, according to Bishop, it's a boon to clean energy startups like his to be able to hire oil and gas workers.\n\nI can teach people power, but I can't teach people the process, procedures and mindset for these big energy projects, he said. Just in Texas alone, we're putting over $100 million of capital to work and we need a level of rigor around project management, safety and process that oil and gas companies are really good at.\n\nHis company specifically recruits current and former gas employees and recent grads who studied for oil and gas jobs.\n\nPeople call Houston the energy capital of the world, but Houston is really an engineering and logistics capital, Medlock said. Those skillsets — managing a supply chain, handling materials, chemical engineering — that's all transferable.\n\nThis is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. And while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. Welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.\n\nPaul Darrow/Reuters Some job skills transfer easily between the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors.\n\nThe idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. Although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (AROs) are fulfilled. Consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the U.S. in need of remediation.\n\nSome pro-transition activists ― like Theron Horton, a strategist with the ARO Working Group ― have suggested that oil workers could be hired by the federal or state governments to perform this work as they train for new jobs.\n\nThere's 10 years of steady jobs for these people, not boom and bust the way it has been in the oil fields, Horton said. And it's work that their skillset and identity is aligned with. Plus, it leaves them in situ — they don't have to move, their kids stay in the same schools. Ten years is a long time to transition, so it's really common sense convergence here. It's also worker solidarity, for these people in the fields not to feel like they're abandoned by society.\n\nBut despite the number of such wells, others, like Medlock, are not convinced that such an approach would put a large enough number of people back to work.\n\nMeanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. The fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. Even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. Between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. So even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.\n\nUnlike the '80s, oil companies these days are competing for workers with more stable and more popular industries, including clean energy.\n\nBishop said he's not worried that the people he's hired away from oil and gas will defect back to fossil fuels if prices hit $100 a barrel again.\n\nPeople want stable, well-paying jobs that have purpose, he said, adding that he's regularly contacted by individuals who have an oil and gas education but are interested in his firm, especially folks coming out of business school. They know they're gonna be in energy, and they see the writing on the wall: You need to be in the energy transition now.\n\nHuffPost's Work In Progress series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by Porticus.

DUBAI (Reuters) — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged the incoming U.S. administration on Wednesday to return to a 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions on Tehran, while welcoming the end of tyrant President Donald Trump's era.\n\nU.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, has said the United States will rejoin the pact, which includes restrictions on Iran's nuclear work, if Tehran resumes strict compliance.\n\nThe ball is in the U.S. court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact, Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting.\n\nToday, we expect the incoming U.S. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years, he said.\n\nTensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump quit the deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran's nuclear program and to prevent it developing atomic weapons. Washington reimposed sanctions that have badly hit Iran's economy.\n\nIran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to Trump's maximum pressure policy by gradually breaching the accord. Tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed.\n\nAntony Blinken, Biden's choice for secretary of state, said on Tuesday the United States would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact.\n\nTyrant Trump's political career and his ominous reign are over today and his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran has completely failed, Rouhani said. Trump is dead but the nuclear deal is still alive.\n\nBiden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on Iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. But Tehran has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy.\n\nBiden's choice to lead the Pentagon, retired Army General Lloyd Austin, said on Tuesday that Iran posed a threat to American allies in the region and forces stationed in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and other Western countries have turned our region to a powder keg, not Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state TV.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Angus MacSwan)
Ready your tractors and plows—the farm bill is upon us. This omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. Yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. Congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 Farm Bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the U.S.\n\nReducing food waste offers a significant opportunity to impact the economy and environment. We spend $218 billion to produce, process, transport, and then dispose of 62.5 million tons of food each year. Wasted food eats up 20% of our nation's freshwater, cropland, and fertilizer before ending up in the landfill, where it adds 113 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere annually. At the same time, one in seven Americans are food insecure. Much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure American.\n\nWith preparations for the 2018 farm bill already under way, now is the time to rethink the role the federal government can play in reducing food waste to protect people, preserve our planet, and provide economic benefits, while helping us value food as a resource. This week, the Food Law and Policy Clinic of Harvard Law School, in partnership with Food Policy Action and ReFED, released Opportunities to Reduce Food Waste in the 2018 Farm Bill, which recommends policies Congress can implement to tackle food waste in the next farm bill.\n\nThere are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. For example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. Broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. For other programs, directing USDA to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.\n\nCongress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. Currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. Misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. The upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. Industry groups are already on board—the Food Marketing Institute and Grocery Manufacturers Association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.\n\nThe 2018 Farm Bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. Many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. In Massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. Measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure. The farm bill could provide dedicated planning and implementation funding to support state governments that implement similar bans, making the wins seen in Massachusetts replicable across the nation.\n\nIn 2015, USDA and EPA announced the first-ever U.S. food waste reduction goal—a bold and aggressive goal of halving our food waste by 2030. If the federal government doesn't invest in food waste reduction, then we will fail to hit the mark. It is time for Congress to tackle the issue of food waste in the U.S.; a farm bill that remains silent on the topic is a missed opportunity to break our food waste habit and achieve significant social, environmental, and economic benefits in return.
A Cincinnati elementary school is under fire for reportedly limiting students' trips to the water fountain.\n\nA sign, photographed hanging on the wall of Carson Elementary School, reads Getting a drink by permission only. That means you must ask the teacher before going out into the hall for a drink. You will get one pass per week to get a drink of water; after that points will be deducted from your grade.\n\nThe school immediately drew criticism for the harsh policy — not only does it have the potential to leave students dehydrated, but it also punishes them for needing a drink. Parents raised the alarm about the sign and made it clear that the policy was unreasonable. You're not going to fail my kid because he's thirsty and he wants a drink, one concerned parent said to a local news channel. If my kid's playing in the gym room and he's hot and sweaty and he asks for a drink and he goes to get a drink, are they going to deduct a point from him? asked another. A mother put it simply, I thought it was not right that they were depriving the children of having water.\n\nThe sign went public on Tuesday, and as of Wednesday, Carson Elementary has already removed it. The school district is calling the policy a misunderstanding. It released a statement apologizing and clarifying the issue: There was a sign posted at Carson Elementary intended to remind students when it is appropriate to ask to leave class for a water fountain break. The sign's directive was outside school policy, a result of a misunderstanding about the school's procedures. When school officials learned about this, the sign was removed. Students are permitted to ask for permission to leave class for needed restroom or water breaks at no risk to their grades. The school district has since confirmed that students' grades will not be affected.\n\nConventional wisdom tells us to drink eight eight-ounce of water per day. According to the Mayo Clinic, the directive is easy to remember, and it's a reasonable goal. Some people may need less than eight glasses per day. As they say, Most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. That extends to students — and means way more than one trip a week to the water fountain.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:
While politicians and policy-makers have made mouth noises about the amount of time spent on the Big Standardized Test and the prep therefor, those elements only scratch the surface of how test-and-punish policy has messed with American schools.\n\nAt various times in ed history we have talked about teacher-centered schools, community-centered schools and student-centered schools. What we have seen over the past decade is the rise of the test-centered school.\n\nIn the test-centered school, regardless of what its mission or vision statement may say, test results are the guiding force.\n\nIn the test-centered school, there are remediation courses, but these are not remedial courses in the classic sense of trying to help students who are behind in their comprehension of content. These are test prep courses, in which students' time and attention is devoted to practicing the skills of test-taking. Perhaps the school uses a program package so that students can work independently on computers, drilling multiple choice responses to test-style questions, over and over and over and over and over, day after day after day after day after mind-numbing day, until the students have been taught that English and/or Math (because these remedial courses are never required in non-tested departments) are miserable disciplines filled with nothing but drudgery and boredom.\n\nThese remediation courses will have two other side effects. First, they will fill up the student's schedule, so that students who have not Done Well Enough on the test must take Remediation 101 instead of shop or art or band or accounting. These will be the students whose strengths are NOT English and Math, but they will not be able to fully pursue their strengths, but must instead spend their school day focusing on their weakness, their area of failure. If you have never spent your days being bad at something, you may not understand just how corrosive to the spirit it is.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of how this is, just imagine switching the classes involved. Sorry, pat, but no Junior Honors English class for you until you can finally play a decent B-flat scale on trumpet, said no school ever. Sorry, Mrs. Bagswatter, but Chris can't sign up for AP Calculus until that physical fitness test is passed in PE.\n\nThe other side effect will be on what the school can offer. Your English and Math teachers will have to make room in their schedule for Test Prep 101, which means that they don't have time to teach any elective courses.\n\nIn fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. Middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though I had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and I've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). One tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. So districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school K-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.\n\nBottom line -- we have districts that are looking at structural changes based not on what's best for the students or even what works best with the available physical plants. They are looking at structural changes primarily based on what will have the best effect on their test-based accountability measures.\n\nIn a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. In Pennsylvania, AP test results can count toward a school's ranking. Many states are now moving toward using SAT's as the BS Test for high school ranking. Consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (Will the AP credit be any use to her at her chosen school? Does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. This spring, somewhere in America, a high school principal is going to say, I don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at Pat's school in Pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. You get Pat in there to take that damn AP test, whether Pat wants to or not.\n\nAnd that ultimately is the problem with test-centered schools; the relationship between the school and the student is turned upside down. Instead of asking, How does this help us meet the educational needs of our students, the school asks, How will this affect our test scores? In a test-centered school, the school is not there to serve the students -- the students are there to meet the needs of the school. And no -- there isn't a scintilla of evidence that test prep serves student needs, nor that test results are an important indicator of their education.\n\nMaybe we offer bribes. Maybe we restructure school. Maybe we drill forever. Maybe we make it clear that we will accept no excuses. It doesn't matter. The students are there to crank out the scores the school wants, and policies are measured by that metric -- will this get students to give us the scores we need from them? That's separated from the question of Does this meet the students' educational needs by a chasm so large that you could lose the entire US education system in it.\n\nSure, much is riding on test-driven policies these days. But at some point administrators and leaders and parents and classroom teachers have to step up and stand for the needs of the students before all else. Because if we aren't going to stand up for our students, what are we going to stand up for?\n\nOriginally posted at Curmudgucation
President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled an economic relief plan that would deliver $1,400 to most Americans and invest in a national vaccination program — and also endorses a whole host of Democratic policy priorities from increasing the minimum wage and expanding paid leave to extending unemployment benefits.\n\nBiden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the American Rescue Plan, on Thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. On average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 Americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. Nearly 1.2 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the Department of Labor.\n\nThe $1.9 trillion plan is designed to both immediately address those crises, while also delivering on longer-term Democratic priorities.\n\nThere is real pain overwhelming the real economy, Biden said. It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis.\n\nThe 19-page outline sprawls from taxes to health care to workplace safety, and it's not clear which of its policies will remain top priorities when negotiations begin in earnest. Some items, such as unemployment benefits, are already on the coming Capitol Hill agenda this year.\n\nThe plan, as currently designed, would likely need bipartisan support to pass Congress. But Democrats, who will soon have control of the Senate majority, also have a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation available to them, which will allow them to pass certain proposals with only a simple majority.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images We are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis, President-elect Joe Biden said.\n\nBiden includes $1,400 direct payments in his proposal, which added to the $600 checks sent out with the last relief package would amount to the $2,000 he vowed to get out to Americans.\n\nIn its last COVID-19 relief bill, Congress extended federal unemployment benefits for gig workers and the long-term jobless only until April. Biden's plan would extend benefits through September, and also boost the $300 per week federal supplement to $400.\n\nThat's a more modest increase than top congressional Democrats are currently demanding. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who will be the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee once Democrats take control of the Senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in March, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit.\n\nThe new jobless claims are going to be especially important to Senate Democrats and it will really strengthen our case, Wyden said Thursday morning, citing new numbers released Thursday showing 18 million Americans claiming unemployment aid. The original four-month law actually reduced the poverty rate.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), right, and Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), will be instrumental to negotiations on this COVID-19 relief and economic recovery package.\n\nThe unemployment provisions, along with the direct payments, have gotten some pushback from left-leaning lawmakers, who had understood Biden's promise of $2,000 to be on top of the existing $600 Congress approved last month, not including them.\n\n″$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told The Washington Post, additionally tweeting that she hoped the unemployment benefit would be retroactive to when the original program lapsed over the summer.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who will soon be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and was among the most vocal champions of the $2,000 checks, was more direct in his praise.\n\nPresident-elect Biden has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic, Sanders said in the statement.\n\nThe plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by Wyden and many Democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. Biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the September cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.\n\nIn a statement after the proposal's release, Wyden said he looked forward to taking the lead on the proposal while reiterating his support for increasing the jobless benefit and making the program more responsive to the economy.\n\nA core pillar of Biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's COVID-19 relief bill offered. Biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer.\n\nThe Biden plan also calls for the federal government to launch community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination clinics to hard-to-reach areas, although the transition team has not specified whether the federal government will be creating and running those centers directly or whether it will simply be providing support to state and local governments, many of which have already launched some efforts along those lines.\n\nAlso in the rescue proposal: A call to hire 100,000 public health workers, both to combat the pandemic and create jobs, as well as funding for schools to test and prepare classrooms for a return to in-person learning.\n\nBiden plans to deliver remarks on Friday outlining his plan to speed up the vaccine rollout in more detail.\n\nThe vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far, he said.\n\nMuch of Biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. It includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs.\n\nThe incoming administration also wants to pass a slew of changes to low-income tax credits that Democrats have sought in recent years, including an increase in refunds for parents from the child tax credit and a boost to the earned income tax credit for childless adults. But Biden has apparently not embraced proposals to make the credits payable in advance, meaning the changes wouldn't benefit anyone until 2022, and would only boost refunds for one tax year.\n\nIf parents received tax credits in advance ― as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.\n\nThe proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything Republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but Biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. The proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid.\n\nThe consensus from economists from everywhere from the Fed to the IMF to other top institutions is that at this very precarious moment in the crisis, the senior Biden official said. The risk of doing too little at this moment is far greater than the risk of doing too much and therefore. The investments in this package will actually deliver real relief, prevent scarring, prevent human suffering and actually put us on a path to a stronger recovery, and a stronger and more stable fiscal position.\n\nThat said, Democrats do have a lot of political considerations to take into account. Many Biden officials remember the political failures of the 2009 economic relief package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a policy that economists maintain was economically sound, but Republicans made so politically toxic that Democrats lost control of the House just a year later.\n\nThat's a history that will likely define the initial negotiations as Biden comes into office with slim majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\nUnity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done, said Biden, who has often insisted he will find common ground with Republicans despite skepticism from other Democrats.\n\nGOP lawmakers were largely silent on the plan on Thursday night — neither Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy released a statement — but the proposal drew praise from the traditionally Republican-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWe applaud the President-elect's focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on, the group said.
During the partial government shutdown that started in December 2018 and became the longest in U.S. history, the fossil fuel-friendly Trump administration plowed ahead with its energy dominance agenda. As about 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, the Interior Department worked to boost oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic, processed fossil fuel drilling applications and permits, and even brought back dozens of furloughed employees to ensure offshore drilling activities continued.\n\nNow, amid a global coronavirus pandemic that has upended daily life and slashed oil prices, Trump and his team have once again prioritized fossil fuel production.\n\nThe administration is considering bailing out the oil and gas industry, which has been hit hard by an overseas price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and a drop in global demand due to the coronavirus. That relief is expected to include the Department of Energy purchasing 77 million barrels of crude oil from U.S. producers, enough to fill the nation's emergency reserve to capacity, at a cost of $2.5 billion.\n\nPresident Trump says he has instructed the secretary of energy to buy large quantities of crude oil for strategic reserve during the coronavirus response https://t.co/FIAmzRAAku pic.twitter.com/fopP207MiW — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 13, 2020\n\nThe Interior Department is also moving forward with fossil fuel lease sales, as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management offered up a sweeping 78 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for bidders on Wednesday despite environmental groups' calls to halt the sales during the pandemic. John Filostrat, a spokesman for the bureau, said the event was live-streamed with only a handful of BOEM workers, with bids submitted either by mail or in person at the bureau's New Orleans office.\n\nWednesday's auction yielded about $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres ― the lowest total for any U.S. offshore auction since 2016, according to Reuters. Twenty-two companies participated in the sale.\n\nThat amounts to roughly half the previous lease sale, which took place last August, and marked the first time since region-wide sales began in 2017 that total bidding failed to surpass $100 million. It's a sign that oil prices are too low for anyone but industry behemoths to make offers, said an analyst for energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\nWith the recent drop in oil price, it came as no surprise that the bidding dollar amount was significantly lower, said Mfon Usoro, a senior research analyst covering the Gulf of Mexico for Wood Mackenzie. We think more lease sales are still in the cards, but higher oil prices will be required for bid amounts to climb back to historical norms.\n\nIndeed, the sale came the same day the price of oil plummeted to its lowest level in 18 years, with West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark for crude, falling to $22.90 per barrel on Wednesday, a 15% plunge and the cheapest price since 2002. Brent crude, the global gauge for oil prices, dropped 9% to $26.16 per barrel. At those prices, it's nearly impossible for many U.S. fracking companies, responsible for the majority of the country's oil production, according to the Energy Information Administration, to pay back steep debts, prompting the Trump administration to consider measures to bail out drillers.\n\nBut analysts told HuffPost last week to expect a wave of bankruptcies of smaller producers that could lead to consolidation within the industry as oil majors, the companies that almost exclusively had the capital to bid in Wednesday's auction, buy up troubled rivals.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images Pump jacks draw crude oil from the Long Beach Oil Field near Signal Hill, California.\n\nPlunging prices and mergers aren't the only things that could cost big oil companies in the near term. Almost immediately after Wednesday's auction took place, the legal challenges began. Earthjustice filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of several environmental groups asking a federal judge to block the Gulf of Mexico lease sale on the grounds that it violated the law by failing to fully analyze the risks new drilling posed to the public. Brettny Hardy, an attorney for Earthjustice, called it the latest example of the administration putting profits before the health and safety of people and the planet.\n\nOnshore, the Bureau of Land Management is scheduled to hold oil and gas auctions this month in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada.\n\nMost of BLM's oil and gas lease sales are run entirely via an online platform (only Alaska does in-person sales, and those are not scheduled until November), so no postponement is planned at this time, BLM spokesman Greg Fuhs told E&E News on Tuesday.\n\nKate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, was among those who expressed outrage over the administration's actions. It's both tone-deaf and fleecing taxpayers to be holding lease sales during a public health crisis, she told HuffPost.\n\nThe Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, an organization representing current and former parks employees, also called on the Department of the Interior to halt oil and gas auctions, as well as public comment periods and major policy proposals.\n\nThere are huge implications and consequences surrounding proposed policy changes and lease sales, Phil Francis, the coalition's chair, said in a statement. These actions should be given full and deliberate consideration, not rushed through at a time when we should be focused on the health and safety of the American people.\n\nThe Interior Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost's question about whether oil and gas operations have been identified as mission critical services. But in an email statement, an agency spokesperson said that the health and safety of the public and our employees is our highest priority.\n\nAll DOI actions, including lease sales, are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis and adjustments are being made to ensure we are allowing for proper public input, while protecting the health and safety of the public and our employees, the statement said.
The staff at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas either interacted with mass shooter Stephen Paddock or entered his room at least 10 times before the night he killed 58 people at a music festival from his suite, a hotel representative has reportedly revealed. The day of the October attack, Paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said.\n\nIt wasn't clear, however, if anyone entered Paddock's room that day, or, if they did, what they saw.\n\nThe revelation was made by a hotel representative responding to questions from the Las Vegas Review-Journal concerning reports that Paddock had hung a do not disturb sign on his door for three days as he prepared for his massacre. The hotel has come under fire for apparently failing to check on a guest who turned out to be a mass killer.\n\nPaddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at Mandalay Bay on Oct. 1. He then killed himself. He had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons. It's not clear what his motive was.\n\nA representative of MGM Resorts, which owns Mandalay Bay, emailed the information on Paddock interactions after the newspaper asked if changes were being considered to hotel policies on entering rooms without a guest's consent.\n\nMandalay Bay staff, room service and housekeeping had contact with [Stephen] Paddock or entered his suite more than ten times over the course of his stay, including the three days leading up to October 1. As a result of these interactions, there was no need to conduct a welfare check on Paddock, the representative said in an email Friday.\n\nThere were numerous interactions with Stephen Paddock every day at the resort, including a room service delivery and a call with housekeeping on October 1, all of which were normal in nature.\n\nThe representative did not respond to further requests to elaborate on details of the interactions or what staff may have observed. The spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed.\n\nAll MGM Resorts properties follow a health and welfare check operating procedure that stipulates a welfare check be performed after two consecutive days where a do not disturb sign has been displayed on the door and the guest has not interacted in person or by phone with housekeeping or other hotel staff over the same period, the representative said in a statement, Fox TV reported. Our staff reserves the right to enter the room if it is deemed appropriate to conduct a welfare check.\n\nAfter criticism that Mandalay Bay apparently did not check on Paddock's room for a period of time, Disney World resorts changed its do not disturb sign to a room occupied sign and said rooms would be checked by staff at least once a day. A spokeswoman did not link the change to the Vegas mass shooting but told the Review-Journal it did so for safety, security and guest experience.
The 116th Congress is the most diverse in history, with incoming members expanding political representation on a number of fronts. For the first time, Congress now includes Muslim women, Native American women, an openly bisexual senator and the youngest woman ever elected to serve in either chamber.\n\nYet despite that progress, Congress is once again beginning a new session without a single member who openly identifies as atheist, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the latest CQ Roll Call Faith on the Hill survey.\n\nThe questionnaire identified only one representative ― Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) ― who says she is religiously unaffiliated. Sinema, who has taken issue with the atheist label in the past, has been the only openly unaffiliated member of Congress since she was elected to the U.S. House in 2012. (She's also the first openly bisexual member of the U.S. Senate).\n\nAn additional 18 members of the 116th Congress responded don't know or didn't list a religious faith on the latest questionnaire.\n\nThe survey underscores a longstanding lack of political representation among the growing ranks of Americans who say they don't believe in God, are questioning the existence of a higher power, or simply don't subscribe to traditional organized religion.\n\nNearly one-quarter of U.S. adults now consider themselves to be religiously unaffiliated, compared to just 0.2 percent of Congress, or 1 in 535 members, according to Pew. Meanwhile, more than 88 percent of Congress identifies as Christian ― including all but two Republicans, both of whom are Jewish ― compared to just 71 percent of the U.S. public. Overall, the 116th Congress is slightly more religiously diverse than the prior Congress, according to Pew.\n\nThis gap in representation has persisted as atheists, nontheists, agnostics and other so-called religious nones continue to battle for public acceptance following decades of social and political prejudice toward their views.\n\nALEX EDELMAN via Getty Images Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) participates in a ceremonial swearing-in on January 3, 2019. Rather than use a traditional Bible, she placed her hand on a book from the Library of Congress that contains the texts of the Arizona and U.S. constitutions, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe simplest definition of an atheist is a person who doesn't believe in the existence of gods. Ten percent of Americans say they fit that description, according to a 2018 Pew survey. In the current political climate, however, the word atheist can be more controversial, often used to hint that someone lacks a moral center or is openly hostile to organized religion.\n\nAmid that cultural backdrop, there have been no open atheists in Congress since 2012, when then-Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) lost his seat to a challenger. Stark had already been in Congress for over three decades when he publicly acknowledged his nonbeliever status in 2007. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also waited until after he'd retired to announce that he doesn't believe in God. No candidate has ever entered Congress as an avowed atheist.\n\nThe absence of openly atheist representation in the highest ranks of government presents a problem for the religiously unaffiliated, said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association (AHA), a nonprofit that promotes the philosophy that people can be good without a god.\n\nIt's critically important to see ourselves reflected in those who represent us, said Speckhardt. When that isn't the case, it's very much like a billboard for minorities who are underrepresented, whoever they are.\n\nBut Speckhardt also called into question the accuracy of the latest Faith on the Hill survey. He noted that Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of God and said he embraces the humanist label, which holds that one can lead meaningful, ethical lives capable of adding to the greater good of humanity without theism or other supernatural beliefs, according to the AHA. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the AHA, has similarly identified as a humanist in the past, though he's distanced himself from the atheist label.\n\nHuffman appears to have responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith on the Faith on the Hill survey. But his office said the data was outdated, and confirmed that Huffman identifies as a nonreligious humanist. Raskin, meanwhile, is among the 34 members of Congress who identify as Jewish.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of God and said he embraces the humanist label, but in a recent survey, he responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith.\n\nWhatever terms congressional representatives choose to identify their religious beliefs, it's clear that the stigma against atheism and lack of religious affiliation in politics is beginning to erode, said Speckhardt.\n\nIn 2018, Huffman and Raskin were among the founding members of the Congressional Freethought Caucus. The group's mission, the founders wrote, is to promote sound public policy based on reason, science, and moral values, protect the secular character of our government, and champion the value of freedom of thought worldwide.\n\nIn the years ahead, Speckhardt said he hopes Congress will make progress on initiatives of particular importance to nonbelievers, including measures to preserve the separation of church and state and protect the rights of nontheists abroad.\n\nThere will be no openly atheist torchbearer helping to lead that charge, at least for now. But it's only a matter of time before that changes, said Speckhardt.\n\nA recent poll commissioned by the AHA suggested that in safely blue districts, a candidate's atheism is a nonissue, or even a plus, for a large portion of the electorate.\n\nWith some members of Congress likely identifying as religious only to avoid the potential negative repercussions of saying they don't believe in God, the nonbeliever community must show that it will have the back of any politician who publicly embraces the atheist mantle, said Speckhardt.\n\n[We have] to point out to them that we would much more appreciate their openness about their deeply held convictions, versus hiding them or lying about them, he said. Their integrity and their alliance on issues matters to voters much more than whether they happen to believe in God or not.\n\nThis has been updated to include a response from Rep. Jared Huffman's office about his beliefs.
Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner speaks in Ottawa on May 7, 2019.\n\nCanada is in crisis.\n\nSo begins the Buffalo Declaration, a document released by Conservative Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel Garner Thursday. The declaration is co-signed by three other Alberta Tories, and demands equality for the province under the constitution.\n\nBesides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these MPs as the Buffalo wing of the Conservative Party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about Western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling Liberals didn't win a single seat in Alberta or Saskatchewan.\n\nIt's also sparked a wave of critiques from Albertans and other people across Canada, arguing that the alienated Westerners don't represent their views and legitimize dangerous separatist sentiments.\n\nWATCH: Alberta premier reacts to letter calling for Ottawa to deny Teck project. Story continues below.\n\nBut what is this document and how seriously should you take it?\n\nHere are some answers to your Buffalo Declaration questions.\n\nWhat is the Buffalo Declaration?\n\nThe Buffalo Declaration is a 13-page document and accompanying webpage released on Feb. 20 signed by four Conservative members of Parliament. It outlines concerns about Alberta's role in the federal government and what the signees call a push for equality for the province. The authors definition of equality has a number of different pillars, from repealing carbon taxes to changing the size of Parliament.\n\nThe declaration outlines the challenges faced by Alberta and possible solutions. It contends that Alberta is physically and economically isolated from Canada's power structures.\n\nIt's structurally quite similar to the 2001 Firewall Letter, written by future-prime minister Stephen Harper and other prominent Albertans to then-premier Ralph Klein urging him to to fully exercise Alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan.\n\nThe Buffalo Declaration, however, is targeted at Justin Trudeau's federal government rather than the provincial one. In fact, it is quite sympathetic to Jason Kenney's UCP government in Alberta and how it's handled separatist sentiment.\n\nWe support Premier Jason Kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's Fair Deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads. But we must go further. Much further.\n\nWe must go further. Much further - The Buffalo Declaration\n\nThe much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. As well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.\n\nIt even asks for Trudeau to recognize Alberta as culturally distinct from the rest of Canada.\n\nThere's a lot going on there.\n\nThe document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how Canada works. Many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal Conservative party before pushing Trudeau on them.\n\nAnd that brings up that this document, notably, is targeted at the upcoming Conservative leadership race.\n\nStory continues after video.\n\nAny leadership contestant for the Conservative Party of Canada who seeks the support of Albertans should be prepared to address this declaration, the document reads.\n\nNotably, Rempel Garner — who's leading the charge on the declaration — has expressed interest in a run for federal party leadership in the past, but has not formally declared anything for the current race.\n\nWho is behind it?\n\nAlberta currently has 33 Conservative MPs in the House of Commons, but only four have signed this document.\n\nRempel Garner is leading the charge on the declaration, but it is also co-signed by Banff-Airdrie MP Blake Richards, Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner MP Glen Motz and Peace River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen.\n\nAlbertans are questioning if confederation is broken. They feel disconnected from, and disrespected by, the rest of Canada, Richards wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nAlberta is not, and never has been, an equal partner in Confederation. The people of my province are suffering and need real, structural change. A line in the sand must be drawn. Here it is. https://t.co/Hc4z5CYN4N — Michelle Rempel Garner (@MichelleRempel) February 20, 2020\n\nMotz was in transit Friday and unable to return HuffPost Canada's request.\n\nA representative from Viersen's office deferred to Rempel Garner for all inquiries related to the declaration.\n\nThe offices of both Rempel Garner and Richards did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nWhy is it called the Buffalo Declaration?\n\nAhead of confederation, the area now covered by Saskatchewan and Alberta was proposed by the then-Northwest Territories premier as a possible large province called Buffalo.\n\nThe federal government feared this would concentrate too much power in one province and grow to rival Quebec and Ontario, the authors argue, though there is little historic evidence proving this.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images A herd of bison is seen in a field west of Calgary.\n\nThe authors argue the name is meant to evoke the glory days of Alberta before it starting being taken advantage of by the federal government.\n\nBut aren't bison a tricky subject on the prairies?\n\nYou bet.\n\nWhen the first European settlers arrived in North America, as many as 60 million bison inhabited the continent's grasslands, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. And yes, bison are different than buffalo. Scientifically speaking, buffalo actually refers to animals like water buffalo in Africa. Bison refers to the big brown woolly folks the Buffalo Declaration used as their logo.\n\nPlains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. Bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to Indigenous communities.\n\nThey have made a comeback in recent times. 2018 was the first time bison roamed freely in Alberta in 140 years.\n\nMany critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using Buffalo in its name.\n\nIt takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #BuffaloDeclaration after an animal sacred to First Nations, when most of their complaints stem from how Canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over Aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — Jeff Rybak🍁 (@JeffRybak) February 21, 2020\n\nHow dare a bunch of white settlers invoke the buffalo that their ancestors deliberately genocided to deprive Indigenous ppls of self-sufficiency, as a declaration of a need to separate. Fuck you colonizer scum. — âpihtawikosisân (@apihtawikosisan) February 21, 2020\n\nWait, all this talk of Western alienation sounds a lot like Wexit?\n\nIt sort of is! The issues and concerns outlined are very similar to those put forward by the folks behind Wexit, aka the separatist movement.\n\nThose folks want Alberta — and sometimes other Western provinces — to leave Canada to a certain degree. Some want to form a new country, others propose joining the United States while others just want Alberta to start governing more of itself a la Quebec.\n\nSeparatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. Opponents of equalization say Alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.\n\nOn this, the Buffalo Declaration and Wexit agree. They also agree on what both sides call an unfair treatment from Ontario in specific.\n\nAnd while the Buffalo Declaration claims to be about the West wanting in as opposed to wanting out, they document does work to legitimize Alberta separatism.\n\nStructural, constitutional change must happen within Confederation or a referendum on Alberta's independence is an inevitability, the declaration reads. It is not our job to explain Alberta's value, it is now up to Canada to show they understand Alberta and our value to Confederation.\n\nOne way or another, Albertans will have equality. - The Buffalo Declaration\n\nThe document even ends with a bit of a threat.\n\nOne way or another, Albertans will have equality.\n\nIt's important to note the struggles that have plagued Alberta separatists for decades, including an unsavoury connection to alt-right and white nationalist movements in the province. Parties have struggled to gain footholds campaigning on these alienation-inspired ideas\n\nThe most recent separatist group, Wexit, has largely faded from public consciousness in the past few months as it struggled to reconcile its more radical members with actual political process.\n\nHow many Albertans actually want this?\n\nThat's the big kicker here. Only four Tory MPs are actually signed on to this declaration.\n\nIf we're talking about alienation and separatist sentiments, according to two different polls in the months following the 2019 election, — one from ThinkHQ and one by Abacus Data, less than 28 per cent of Albertans surveyed actually support separatism.\n\nIt's difficult to gauge support for the policies outlined in the Buffalo Declaration because, frankly, they have so many different goals, varying in scope.\n\nSupport for having Trudeau acknowledge Alberta as a distinct culture is likely vastly different than rewriting the constitution to give Alberta more seats in Parliament.\n\nWhat are the people saying about this?\n\nWhile there is little formal polling on it, the document's been heavily critiqued on social media, with people particularly drawing attention to its ideas around Alberta's unique culture and the assertion that the province is treated like a colony, many calling the latter statement outright racist.\n\nI long for the day when #cdnpoli sees this for the racist ahistorical revisionism it is and sanctions politicians who try to trade in it accordingly https://t.co/VfJbGUc2OO — Melanee Thomas (@MelaneeLThomas) February 20, 2020\n\nThanks to @MichelleRempel for defending Albertas distinctive culture.

ILLUSTRATED BY LOUISA CANNELL.\n\nEngagement rings may no longer be required to cost three months' worth of income, but they are still pretty expensive. It might be the last thing on your mind when you got engaged, but just like any other forms of valuables, financial protection is called for in case something bad happens to it.\n\nPeople often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy, says Jerry Ehrenwald, president and CEO of the International Gemological Institute. However, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item. Every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. Read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started.\n\nPick A Provider\n\nDetermine the type of coverage you actually need: Most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. However, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a rider — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. Give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you.\n\nGet An Appraisal\n\nA receipt for your ring is required by the insurance provider, and you'll also need to get a jewelry appraisal to determine the real value of your ring. Check your insurance company's guidelines to make sure that the type of appraisal you're paying for fits the requirements. The American Gem Society has an online directory for the appraisers in your area. Expect to fork over $50 to $100 an hour for this service, based on an estimate listed on Jewelers Mutual.\n\nHow Much It Costs\n\nEngagement ring insurance plans work on an annual basis, and according to Investopedia, you'll be paying $1 to $2 for every $100 the ring is worth. The number fluctuates according to where you're based: You'll be expected to pay more for your coverage for places with higher theft rates.\n\nRead The Fine Print\n\nAs with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. Some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. Another important answer to get on paper: What counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. If you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as GemSafe.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN on Friday that she definitely will seek the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, ending months of speculation.\n\nHer bid makes sense on its face: Democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like Gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (She is a military veteran and was the first Hindu member of Congress.) Much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. In 2016, she surrendered a plum Democratic National Committee post so she could endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and argue top Democrats were unfairly helping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.\n\nProgressives are already welcoming the news: Let them make their case and we'll find out who has the most compelling narrative, commentator Cenk Uygur said of Gabbard's taking on left favorites Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose 2020 plans are already in motion.\n\nBut the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond America's shores. Like Sanders and Warren, Gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. What she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.\n\nOn domestic matters, Gabbard is in line with her counterparts: She supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says Democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. Yet on foreign policy, she's gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every Democrat (and Republicans like President Donald Trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by American empire.\n\nGabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the U.S. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. It's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that Trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of Iraq. (Why have politicians of both parties gotten Americans trapped in these far-away places?)\n\nAnd it connects seamlessly to another Trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly Muslims. Gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from Iraq and Syria to enter the U.S., courted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite his links to anti-Muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a Fox News darling for her willingness to claim President Barack Obama was making Americans less safe by supporting Arab rebels in Syria and not using the phrase radical Islam. (Obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; Gabbard and Trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the Islamic State.)\n\nWhat Sanders and Warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of U.S. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not Americans' problem. They're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with Clinton and many Republicans — the idea that U.S.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. They have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like Russia for the sake of American global standing. Instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of U.S. citizens as well as people abroad.\n\nThe Sanders/Warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the U.S. and in rivals like Russia and China. In that view, challenging the status quo of American foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as Gabbard did with brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-American regimes like Assad's or U.S. partners like Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism, said Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank.\n\nGabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction, she added, referring to a school of national security thought that suggests it's a waste of time for the U.S. and others to try to prioritize principles like inalienable human rights in global affairs.\n\nThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism. Gabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction. Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank\n\nTo Hurlburt, a longtime follower of the debate over how Democrats should talk about foreign policy, it's difficult to see who Gabbard will appeal to.\n\nThere's a mass feeling across the public… that Trump has walked away from what are perceived as American values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, Hurlburt said. She sees Sanders and Warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.\n\nAs the race takes shape, Gabbard's rivals ― of whom there are likely to be many ― will know they can make political hay of her controversial views and over episodes like her visit to Assad amid his devastating campaign against his own people.\n\nWhat's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. Gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the Sanders Institute, founded by the senator's wife, Jane Sanders, and frequently posturing as the Democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed Trump's strike against Assad in 2017.\n\nThe quiet hope among backers of Sanders and Warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.\n\nBut that's far from assured, given that many of Gabbard's supporters ― particularly in parts of the peace movement ― are fervent and have been hoping for this kind of announcement by her for years.\n\nThe left realists are present in a lot of places and are able to be spoilers quite effectively, Hurlburt said. Though their numbers are vanishingly small, they're loud and articulate, and they have a critique that can be very resonant when you look at some of the disasters going on around us.\n\nHow the contest evolves will determine how serious that fight gets ― and for now, it hasn't even officially begun.\n\nThere's no incentive for anyone to make any point out of attacking Gabbard loudly and publicly unless she starts to get some traction, Hurlburt said.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Gabbard's role at the Sanders Institute.
Stefani Reynolds via Getty Images David Frederick would run the office that represents the United States before the Supreme Court if he became Joe Biden's solicitor general.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. We should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a February debate. And on his campaign website, Biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.\n\nNow just weeks away from inauguration, the president-elect is considering a corporate lawyer who has defended Royal Dutch Shell against climate liability lawsuits to serve as solicitor general, the administration's top legal advocate who argues cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to two sources with knowledge of the process.\n\nDavid Frederick, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, is considered a serious enough candidate for solicitor general that the group Demand Justice singled him out as someone it would oppose in a public letter last month.\n\nFrederick served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.\n\nThe Biden transition team, which is expected to announce its Justice Department picks sometime after Tuesday's closely watched Senate runoff elections in Georgia, did not respond to questions about Frederick's candidacy.\n\nThroughout his lengthy legal career, Frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of Tyson Foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that British oil giant BP tried to build in Delaware waters.\n\nBut some progressive advocates say Frederick's recent work defending Shell, in which he's argued that lawsuits trying to hold oil companies liable for climate change have no legal grounds, should be disqualifying.\n\nKellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, PLLC Frederick, pictured here in his law firm website photo, is a widely known Democratic litigator who has already argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court.\n\nSurely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said Jesse Bragg, the media director at the Boston-based anti-corruption group Corporate Accountability. Experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.\n\nReached by email, Frederick directed HuffPost to his law firm. The firm declined to comment.\n\nThe Equivalent Of Saying 'Oh, Murder Is Not Illegal'\n\nA flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon Mobil Corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. Three years later, the Dutch publication De Correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after Shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.\n\nFive states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the U.S. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.\n\nThe industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, Harold Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who served as legal adviser to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told Inside Climate News. The taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. The companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.\n\nIn court filings in California and Rhode Island last year, Frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing Shell and other oil companies over climate change. He contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that Shell could only face climate litigation in the Netherlands, where it is headquartered.\n\nIt's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'Sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said Marco Simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. This is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'Oh, murder is not illegal.'\n\nThe pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting Shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. Two of the biggest cases against rival Exxon Mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in New York and Massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.\n\nAccused Of Selling 'His Progressive Bona Fides'\n\nLawyers who have argued cases alongside Frederick say his record shows that he's willing to take on the oil industry.\n\nWhile representing the state of Delaware in the mid-2000s, he persuaded the Supreme Court to block BP's bid to build a liquefied natural gas facility in Delaware waters on the grounds that it violated state laws protecting the coastline.\n\nHe worked tirelessly to protect the Coastal Zone Act in Delaware, which is one of our treasured environmental laws, said Max Walton, a partner at the Wilmington, Delaware-based law firm Connolly Gallagher who argued the case with Frederick. I can't think of a human being who works harder and smarter and more fair than David Frederick.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make climate a top priority of his administration.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against Exxon Mobil in a case that Frederick argued on behalf of the state of New Hampshire, forcing the oil giant to pay a $236 million fine for contaminating groundwater.\n\nDavid Frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer Supreme Court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 Supreme Court arguments, Todd Webster, a former chief of staff to Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), told Politico last month. He is literally the guy progressives turn to when their cases reach the Supreme Court, so that we win at that level.\n\nBut progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like Shell.\n\nWhat Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project. Frederick is selling to Shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.\n\nShell did not return a call requesting comment.\n\nAt Odds With The Future Vice President\n\nFrederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming Biden administration. Among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing Oakland's case against five oil giants, including Shell, to move forward in the California courts were Vice President-elect Kamala Harris; Biden's secretary of state pick, Antony Blinken; his future climate diplomat, John Kerry; his choice for climate czar, Gina McCarthy; and Xavier Becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.\n\nOther potential names reportedly under consideration for solicitor general include Sherrilyn Ifill, director of the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund; David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union; and Barbara Underwood, New York state's solicitor general.\n\nThere's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, Hauser said. We don't need to rotate between Republican Big Law and Democratic Big Law.\n\nKevin Robillard contributed reporting.
Lou Dobbs guest Ed Rollins refers to sitting congresswoman @AOC as the little girl pic.twitter.com/pJyjaBGX91\n\nRepublican political strategist and campaign consultant Ed Rollins dismissively referred to 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the little girl with a big mouth.\n\nThat triggered a trademark zinger from the congresswoman, who called Rollins a walking argument for a 100 percent tax on misogyny.\n\nRollins told Fox News' Lou Dobbs on Friday: If you're going to put her out front with her mouth ... the little girl who wants pre-Reagan economics of 70 percent taxes, the Democratic women are basically going to be damaged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said in a tweet that such attacks on women are apparently the best argument Republicans have in policy debates.\n\nGOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this dude is a walking argument to tax misogyny at 100% 😉\n\n\n\nRepublicans rob everyone the opportunity of real policy debate by resorting to this. https://t.co/Yk3BTHbtxv — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 5, 2019\n\nBut what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman. A similar tax rate was imposed in the U.S. for 35 years after World War II, which included some of the most successful periods of economic growth in history, Krugman wrote.\n\nTax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, Krugman noted. And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.\n\nA policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want, Krugman wrote.\n\nNobel economics laureate Peter Diamond — arguably the world's leading expert in public finance, according to Krugman — has calculated the optimum top tax rate at 73 percent. Several other experts back that up.\n\nSo Ocasio-Cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, Krugman added. Republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.\n\nKrugman's conclusion: Ocasio-Cortez definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the GOP caucus.
Sheldon Adelson, Conservative Donor And Casino Titan, Dies At 87\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUpdated at 12:27 p.m. ET\n\nCasino magnate Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific donors in conservative politics, died Monday night at the age of 87 due to complications from treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to a statement from Las Vegas Sands, the company he founded.\n\nAdelson made his fortune — a net worth of around $35 billion according to an estimate by Forbes — in the casino hotel industry. He spent much of it backing conservative politicians in the U.S. and Israel, shaping the political debate of both countries.\n\nHe was in the first wave of superwealthy Americans to take advantage of the Supreme Court's controversial Citizens United ruling, which opened the doors to eight- and nine-figure political donations so long as the money goes to independent superPACs and not candidates or party committees.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP\n\nSerial entrepreneur\n\nAdelson grew up poor in Dorchester, Mass. His parents were immigrants. His father drove a cab.\n\nWhen I was 12, I bought my first business, said Adelson, who started out selling newspapers on the street. He told the story during a videotaped court deposition in 2008. You know, you hold the newspaper in your hand and say, 'Hey, get your Daily Record.' We would yell that out. We would hawk newspapers, Adelson said.\n\nBy age 16, he had bought his second business — vending machines. And he kept on selling — packages of toiletries, spray cans of windshield de-icer. He ran a tour business and got into venture capital.\n\nThen, early in the personal computer era, he bought an influential computer trade show called Comdex and held it in Las Vegas.\n\nComdex took off, so Adelson bought the legendary Sands Hotel and Casino and built a million-square-foot convention center behind it. It was the start of a new Las Vegas, a place that catered to big conventions all week long — not just the weekend crowd that came in for gambling and the shows.\n\nI think if you had to single out one individual who brought that kind of component to the city, it would be Sheldon Adelson, said Sig Rogich, a longtime Las Vegas communications consultant. He was a transformational figure in Las Vegas history.\n\nIn 1996, Adelson imploded the Sands and built the Venetian, a complex with more than 8,000 rooms and more than 150 stores and restaurants. It's a model that he replicated in Macau and Singapore with enormous profit.\n\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, and you can't get rid of it. So that's what I did, Adelson told the American Gaming Association convention in 2014.\n\nAlong the way, Adelson had battles. In the Comdex days, he fought the other casino owners. When he put up the Venetian, he froze out the unions that had represented workers at the old Sands.\n\nAnybody who stands up to him or stands in his way, he'll try to crush, said D. Taylor, international president of the labor group UNITE HERE and a long time labor leader in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2015, the Adelson family bought the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper, in a sale originally shrouded in mystery and investigated by the publication's own journalists. There were several newsroom resignations after that sale, including a columnist who was told he could not write about Adelson.\n\nThe Adelson primary\n\nThe fortune Adelson made in the casino business was spent generously on donations to Jewish causes, medical research and the Republican Party. He and his wife, Miriam, gave around $500 million over the past eight years to Republican and conservative campaigns.\n\nThe couple's prolific political giving led to what was sometimes called the Adelson primary, in which GOP presidential hopefuls would flock to Las Vegas to court Adelson and the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\nHey, listen, Sheldon, thanks for inviting me, said then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich at one such event in 2014. I don't travel to these things much, but this is one that I thought was really, really important.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential primaries, Adelson initially appeared to back Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who received the endorsement of Adelson's Review-Journal. Unlike Rubio, Donald Trump said he didn't need Adelson's money. If Sheldon gives to him, he'll have total control over Rubio, and that's the problem with the way the system works, said Trump in an interview with Fox News.\n\nBut after early reservations, the Adelsons backed Trump's 2016 election effort; they gave $5 million to his inaugural committee and then donated about $500,000 to the legal defense fund for his White House aides. During the 2018 midterms, the Adelsons donated more than $100 million to Republicans.\n\nTrump awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018; the citation praised her work and philanthropy in combating addiction. You have been truly incredible, Trump told her at the event, before looking out to the crowd. Here to celebrate Miriam's award is Sheldon. Where is Sheldon? Where is Sheldon? Where is he? There he is. Oh, you didn't make the front row. He's probably angry.\n\nIn statement Tuesday, Trump said, His ingenuity, genius, and creativity earned him immense wealth, but his character and philanthropic generosity his great name. Sheldon was also a staunch supporter of our great ally the State of Israel.\n\nWhile Adelson was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party, he wasn't always in sync with the party's positions, telling reporters in 2012, On the social issues, I'm not pro-life; I'm pro-choice.\n\nAdelson continued to support Trump in his reelection bid, though about a week after the election, his newspaper's editorial board said the defeated president was trying to delay the inevitable. The editorial column blasted the unfounded claims of voter fraud Trump and his allies were perpetuating.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBirthright Israel; Jerusalem embassy\n\nAdelson also spent heavily on conservative causes in Israel.\n\nHe was a primary backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a biography of the Israeli leader by journalist Anshel Pfeffer, Netanyahu helped the Adelsons secure unprecedented access to hold their wedding reception in the Israeli parliament building.\n\nIn 2007, Adelson launched Israel Today, a free daily that has become Israel's largest circulation newspaper. It features cheerleading coverage of Netanyahu and his family, a key asset in Netanyahu's longtime quest for positive press coverage in Israel. When Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress in 2015 against the Iran nuclear deal, Adelson was in the gallery.\n\nAdelson also helped bankroll Birthright Israel, a program partially funded by the Israeli government to send Jewish youth from around the world to Israel on free guided trips.\n\nHe was a forceful advocate for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Adelson heavily supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign in part because of his support for moving the embassy.\n\nWhile the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations rejected such a move, Trump's administration embraced the policy.\n\nAdelson even offered to pay for at least part of the cost of building a new embassy.\n\nAt the dedication ceremony for the new embassy in May 2018, the Adelsons sat in the front row just a few feet away from Netanyahu, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nNPR international correspondent Daniel Estrin contributed reporting to this story.
Democrats Want To Work On A Sound Border System, Rep. Thompson Says\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump made a case last night that he is not against immigrants. He says he is against those who break the law.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nINSKEEP: The president made that case from behind his desk in the Oval Office. It was a pose, before the cameras, that predecessors since Harry Truman have assumed. In this case, the president was demanding a border wall as his price for reopening parts of the government. Those listening to the speech included our next guest. He is Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. He is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which means he is the newly empowered chairman.\n\nMr. Chairman, good morning.\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you accept the President's contention there that illegal immigration is a drag on the country?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, I think, first of all, you have to say that the president didn't give us anything new. We have a problem with immigration, but we can fix it. What we're dealing with now, though, is a manufactured problem created by some policies implemented by this administration that has actually put a greater strain on our system of immigration.\n\nINSKEEP: Let me make sure I understand there. You say there's a real problem and a manufactured problem. Define the real problem, please.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, the problem is we have about 13 million people in this country who are here, in one form or another, illegally - visa overstays or what have you. But this notion that those individuals are terrorists, those individuals are murderers, robbers - very few of them. Our experience and information lead us to believe that many of them are just hardworking people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. Our system of immigration in this country needs fixing. And so what we're trying to say to the president is, you don't have to fan the flames of hysteria to fix an immigration system. You just need to do it. A wall won't fix an immigration system. Common sense, listening to the professionals who say technology and some other things is the way to go is how you begin the process of fixing an immigration system. So...\n\nINSKEEP: Now, the president is correct, though, that there are people who cross the border illegally or who arrive seeking asylum. And as you know, there has been an increase recently in the number of unaccompanied minors and families coming to the border. And in his speech last night, the president argued that a border wall is not just better for citizens, in his view, it's also better for migrants if they're deterred from coming. Let's listen to some of that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS)\n\nTRUMP: This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States - a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, Mr. Chairman, this is something the Obama administration could have said. And in fact, they did say this is a very dangerous journey, it's hazardous for people, it would be better for many if they didn't come. Is the president right?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. We wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. So what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. Teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. So what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. So again, let me be very clear. Democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.\n\nINSKEEP: Is homeland security at risk because of the shutdown? There are Coast Guard and other homeland security personnel who are not being paid even though they are working.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no real correlation between border security and this shutdown. The president has tried to manufacture and up the ante by this shutdown. We have some 800,000 employees. We have 450 airports in this country manned by TSA workers who may or may not get paid this Friday. That's not how you run an effective system of national security for those who travel. Our Coast Guard individuals, as you know, recently got paid because of a unique formula for handling the money. I'm not certain that they will be able to do it next time. Those men and women of TSA and the Coast Guard do a wonderful job.\n\nINSKEEP: So is homeland security at greater risk because of that situation?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there's no question they're at risk because the morale of people working at airports - and they are some of the lowest-paid people in the system. And so now we are doing this to them. My comment is - Mr. President, put the people back to work so we can keep America safe.\n\nINSKEEP: Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciated talking to you.\n\nTHOMPSON: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: Bennie Thompson of Mississippi chairs the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Lehigh University Revokes President Trump's Honorary Degree\n\nLehigh University has revoked an honorary degree that President Trump held for more than 30 years. The Pennsylvania school's board of trustees held a special vote this week after Trump incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe decision came after a special session of the Executive Committee on Thursday and was fully affirmed earlier today, student newspaper The Brown and White reported.\n\nNumerous petitions had previously sought to rescind the honor for Trump, who was awarded the degree when he spoke at the school's commencement ceremony in 1988.\n\nThree years ago, one such effort garnered nearly 80,000 signatures. That petition drive also presented a point-by-point argument that accused the president of falling short of the university's values.\n\nThis individual should reflect the goals and values of Lehigh University, the petition noted, quoting the school's official policy for commencement speakers, who are routinely awarded honorary degrees. Nominees should be someone whose work and achievements reflect our value system at Lehigh.\n\nOn Thursday, Lehigh University President John Simon issued a statement calling the events at the Capitol a violent assault on U.S. democracy, the will of the American people and the transfer of power.\n\nIn response to those words, several alumni and faculty members renewed their call for the school to rescind Trump's honorary degree, posting a link to a new online petition.
In 2005, Trump Was Hit With A Tax That He Now Wants To Abolish\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nPresident Trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.\n\nA two-page tax return, filed by Trump for 2005 and revealed Tuesday, may suggest one reason. Because of the AMT, Trump was required to pay about $38 million in taxes on income of more than $150 million that year.\n\nWithout it, Trump's bill would have been a lot lower.\n\nThe AMT, which Trump has proposed eliminating, operates as a sort of parallel tax: If you claim too many of the wrong kind of deductions and try to get by with paying too little, you automatically find yourself bumped into the world of the AMT, where different rules — and higher rates — apply.\n\nIn other words, if you thought you were going to lower your tax bill by claiming a lot of deductions, think again.\n\nThe AMT was passed into law in 1969, amid public outrage over reports that some 155 ultrawealthy people had escaped paying federal taxes altogether by using loopholes and tax shelters, says Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut over time, it has morphed and changed and now sucks in a lot of taxpayers who are merely very comfortable.\n\nIt is a stupid tax. It's poorly targeted, Burman says.\n\nThe people most likely to be hit with the AMT are not billionaires, but people earning incomes of $500,000 to $1 million a year. Burman says 62 percent of them are expected to pay the tax in 2017.\n\nOf those who earn between $200,000 and $500,000 a year, 31 percent will pay the tax.\n\nBut among those making more than $1 million a year, only 18 percent get hit.\n\nThat's because the AMT tends to kick in for certain kinds of deductions more than others.\n\nIf you live in a high-tax place such as New Jersey or New York and deduct the state and local taxes you pay, that deduction will be counted toward the AMT. The same goes for people who claim children and other dependents as personal exemptions.\n\nBut the types of deductions favored by the ultrawealthy, such as tax shelters, don't get counted, Burman says. Income from capital gains also gets preferential treatment under the AMT.\n\nThat means someone like Warren Buffett, who gets most of his income from stock investments, can pay a very low rate without triggering the AMT, while a well-paid executive from Westchester County with lots of kids probably can't.\n\nWhy Trump got hit by the AMT in 2005 isn't clear without more details than were included in the two-page return released Tuesday night by journalist David Cay Johnston.\n\nThere are a bunch of technical preferences that can throw you onto the AMT, and it looks like Donald Trump fell afoul of one or two of them, Burman says.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the AMT meant Trump had to pay much higher taxes than he otherwise would.\n\nWithout the alternative minimum tax, Donald Trump would have paid a lower tax rate in 2005 than the poorest half of Americans — just 3.48 percent — despite income of more than $150 million. Trump wants to abolish the AMT. Now we know why, said Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente.\n\nTrump is by no means the first politician to take aim at the AMT. In fact, economists, tax lawyers and members of Congress have long discussed abolishing or reforming it.\n\nBut it's never happened, in part because it raises too much money. The AMT is projected to bring in some $40 billion to $50 billion a year to the federal government over the next decade.
Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed\n\nRachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nI'm joined now by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. He was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign. Scott, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.\n\nMARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.\n\nJENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.\n\nMARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?\n\nJENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.\n\nMARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...\n\nMARTIN: Although...\n\nJENNINGS: ...And gets us past this issue.\n\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.\n\nMARTIN: Which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. Republican strategist Scott Jennings for us this morning.\n\nScott, thanks, as always. We appreciate it.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you very much.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Tax The Ultrarich To Solve Poverty? Easier Said Than Done\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nichole Sobecki for NPR Nichole Sobecki for NPR\n\nA new report from Oxfam says that just 1 percent of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' fortune — estimated at $112 billion — would cover Ethiopia's entire annual health budget. That's health care for 105 million people.\n\nSo, Oxfam proposes, let's tax the rich to help the poor.\n\nIt's not a new idea. In fact, Oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity — $8.4 trillion in 2018 — with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity — $1.4 trillion. The reports coincide with the World Economic Forum, where elites gather in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.\n\nThe latest report — published on Monday and called Public Good or Private Wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. In 2017, it was 43 individuals.\n\nBut would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?\n\nOxfam thinks so. Its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to U.N. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.\n\nThe rich are doing very well — thank you very much — and those on the wrong end are working harder and harder for less and less everywhere we look, says Paul O'Brien, Oxfam America's vice president for policy and advocacy.\n\nReducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, Oxfam argues.\n\nAnd that's certainly a pressing issue. Even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the World Bank has warned that progress is slowing. What's more worrying, according to Oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to Forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.\n\nBut is a global wealth tax realistic?\n\nO'Brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. But he is optimistic about the odds. Major agencies like the International Monetary Fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the World Economic Forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.\n\nBut until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. The Oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.\n\nAccording to Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.\n\nFor example, a couple of years ago, the Tax Justice Network worked with the Australian Taxation Office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through Singapore. Oil and gas giant Chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.\n\nProper taxation is important, but it's one thing among many that we need to do to address poverty, says Vijaya Ramachandran, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\n\nRamachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. The Oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.\n\nCash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. The idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. The stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThen there are what Harvard Business School professor and co-author of The Prosperity Paradox Clayton Christensen calls market-creating innovations. Christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. But outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.\n\nOn the other hand, Christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in Mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. These types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.\n\nWhether through a global wealth tax or other practices, Oxfam's O'Brien just wants to see inequality reduced now.\n\nHopefully, we won't have to talk next year, he told me, because we'll have solved global extreme inequality!\n\nJoanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequality.

Despite Frigid Weather, The Snow In Pyeongchang Is Fake\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\nIf you've been watching the Winter Games on TV, you may have noticed there's not a lot of snow in Pyeongchang. While the South Korean region is known for its frigid winters, major snowstorms are rare in February.\n\nThat's where Snow Making Inc. (SMI), comes in. The Michigan-based company has installed snow-making machines at seven Winter Olympics, including Pyeongchang.\n\nDepending on which venue it is, we estimate between 90 and 98 percent of the snow that's there has been machine-made and produced in advance of the games, Joe VanderKelen, president of SMI, tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson.\n\nThe Games' organizers spent nearly $6 million to bring in snow cannons, which push cold water and pressurized air through a snow gun to produce artificial snow. At past Olympics in Sochi and Vancouver, the host cities also deployed fake snow on mountain ranges due to unseasonably warmer weather.\n\nMachine-made snow is like one-week or two-week-old natural snow that's been sitting there and takes a while to go into a different grain size, and actually can become a better surface once it's tilled for the athletes, VanderKelen says.\n\nSurprisingly, athletes prefer manufactured snow because it is more consistent, he adds. When preparing the courses, organizers will actually push off natural snow before spreading the fake stuff.\n\nThe racers like a very hard surface that minimizes rutting, so that between the 40 and 60 competitors that might race they're trying to keep that surface as consistent as they can as they carve those gates and those corners, VanderKelen says. So they really like a very hard surface, and they don't like natural snow at all.\n\nSMI's fully automated snow-making system consists of 100 snow cannons posted on towers and carriages at the Jeongseon Alpine Center, according the company's website. The entire system can store up to 33.6 million gallons of water, which is enough to fill 51 Olympic-size swimming pools.\n\nTake the Jeongseon Alpine venue. We've had people over there since early November, and they pretty much made snow from November 15 until about January 10, VanderKelen says. They converted around 200 million gallons of water into snow during that time and then stored it until the games began.\n\nThe next host of the Winter Olympics, Beijing, will almost completely depend on man-made snow, according to a 2015 report by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThere would be no opportunity to haul snow from higher elevations for contingency maintenance to the race courses so a contingency plan would rely on stockpiled man-made snow, the IOC wrote, a month before it designated Beijing the 2022 host.\n\nThough harmful to the environment, the technology behind man-made show has become more energy efficient, VanderKelen says.\n\nThe end result for the mountain resorts around the world is they're making a lot more snow, a lot more efficiently, at a lot warmer temperatures, for a lot less money, he says.\n\nBut a lack of snowfall has proven harmful to the commercial ski industry. A low-snow year can cost the U.S. winter sports industry up to $1 billion, according to a report by Protect Our Winters, a climate advocacy nonprofit.

Pope Francis Accuses Bishop's Critics Of Slander, Riling Sex Abuse Victims In Chile\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPope Francis has accused victims of sexual abuse in Chile of slander, saying their attacks on a bishop who's accused of covering up the abuse amount to calumny. The remarks triggered anger and demonstrations in Chile, where several churches have been firebombed in the past week.\n\nOn the last day of his visit to Chile, Francis set the simmering resentment some hold against the Catholic Church to a full boil with his defense of Bishop Juan Barros. The bishop has been hotly criticized ever since the pope appointed him in 2015. Barros was the protégé of Rev. Fernando Karadima, a notorious disgraced priest who served in the southern city of Osorno and who was found guilty and dismissed in 2011 for abusing dozens of minors over a decades-long period beginning in the 1980s.\n\nKaradima became the face of the church's sexual abuse scandal in Chile. And his victims say they believe Barros knew about the priest's abuse but did nothing to stop it or report it. As recently as this week, Barros has denied witnessing any abuse.\n\nIn trying to reconcile his church with its followers over decades of sexual abuse, the pope has embraced a zero tolerance policy. When a Chilean journalist asked Francis about Barros, the Associated Press reports, Francis replied, The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I'll speak.\n\nHe added, There is not one shred of proof against him. It's all calumny. Is that clear?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters\n\nThe comment immediately set off a backlash, with abuse victims speaking out on Twitter and elsewhere, with many saying the statement echoed the skepticism and denial that had met with their claims. One victim, Juan Carlos Cruz, replied, As if one could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others while Barros stood by.\n\nAdding to the drama, the exchange took place one week after the Associated Press reportedly Francis had written a letter in January of 2015 about the Vatican's attempt to cope with the fallout from Karadima. In it, the agency said, Francis acknowledged the controversy around Barros and referred to a previous plan to ask for Barros' resignation.\n\nOn Thursday, the pope's remarks dismissing Barros' critics came in Iquique, where the controversial bishop was on hand as Francis celebrated a mass at a beach.\n\nWith Pope Francis' visit to Chile now over, the newspaper Clarin is calling it the worst of his five years as pope, citing his remarks about Barros and comparatively low turnouts for Francis' public events in the country.\n\nDays earlier, Francis had asked for forgiveness and sought to heal old wounds over the Church's handling of abuse. On the first day of his visit to Chile, he spoke of the pain and shame, that I feel at the irreparable damage caused to children by ministers of the Church.\n\nShortly after making that statement on Tuesday, Francis met with a small group of victims of sexual abuse in Santiago, in a meeting at which the Vatican says the pope listened to them and prayed and cried with them.\n\nAt least five Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week, some with firebombs. The attacks have also included vandalism and graffiti, including accusations and threats against Pope Francis. After spending several days in Chile, the pope is now in Peru on the next stage of his tour.
Senate Leader McConnell Condemns GOP Objections To Election Results\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who worked for Sen. Mitch McConnell, about the outgoing majority leader, and the GOP's response to the mob that broke into the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nTwo Senate elections in Georgia have given Democrats control of the United States Senate. That means that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell loses his post after six years in power. McConnell's final act as majority leader is proving to be his response to the president's continuing attack on democracy.\n\nWhen Joe Biden's win became clear in early November, Mitch McConnell stood on the Senate floor. Instead of congratulating the obvious winner, he gave a carefully worded statement. He did not repeat the president's false claims of fraud but did say the formal process should play out.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.\n\nINSKEEP: Six weeks later, in mid-December, Joe Biden's win was confirmed after every legal challenge failed. McConnell then spoke again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.\n\nINSKEEP: In recent days, McConnell tried to prevent Congress from debating the baseless claims of fraud in yesterday's session, but it was not until yesterday that McConnell forcefully and in detail refuted the president's election claims as completely baseless. He added that Congress was no place to litigate them.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts and the states - they've all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.\n\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell said his vote to override objections to this election was the most important vote of his 36 years in Congress. As he spoke, insurrectionists were already descending on the Capitol. They briefly disrupted the proceedings, although they resumed and were completed overnight.\n\nScott Jennings is with us now. He is a Republican strategist who has worked with Mitch McConnell over the years. Mr. Jennings, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Thanks and good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: Mitch McConnell's speech yesterday was really quite powerful, but I have to ask if it was a mistake for him to wait two months to give it.\n\nJENNINGS: Well, he works at the speed of the institution. I mean, I think most Republicans said after the election that if Donald Trump had issues with the votes that he should take it to court. That's the proper venue for the adjudication of claims. He did that. Every single court that looked at it did not agree. The Electoral College met. And that's immediately when Mitch McConnell acknowledged that Joe Biden was the president-elect. And then yesterday, after the president would not stop indulging this fantasy that the election was stolen, Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor and made a powerful speech. And I thought, frankly, it was one of his finest hours. It's regrettable that he had to actually give that speech.\n\nDonald Trump is the cause of everything that happened yesterday. Some people stood tall, and some people gave in to it still. And I thought McConnell was one of those that stood tall.\n\nINSKEEP: You're exactly correct that McConnell did not give in to it yesterday, but I do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. Mitch McConnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. He did not always support the president. On a number of occasions, he criticized the president. But there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. Should he have said more sooner?\n\nJENNINGS: I think the president over the years had an agenda, and Mitch McConnell felt like that as the Republican leader, it was his job to try to help the president get outcomes on that agenda. He did that and, frankly, did it pretty faithfully and did get some outcomes for the president that I'm not sure he could've gotten without Mitch McConnell's skill in legislative maneuvering.\n\nBut, look; once the election was over and the claims had been adjudicated and the votes were counted, Mitch McConnell stuck by the institution and the norms and the gears of our democracy. And he was not about to let Donald Trump live in an alternate bubble. And I think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. And he - and - you know, convinced most of the Republicans in the Senate that the Republicans should not indulge what Donald Trump was doing. It's, I think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.\n\nBut I thought McConnell did what he did on the calendar of the institution, according to the gears of our democracy. Wasn't fast enough for some people, but he did it. And I think the message that he gave was exactly the right one.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's hear one of those who indulged the president yesterday, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Even after the violence and the disruption in the Capitol, when senators came back in and the House of Representatives came back in, he spoke on the Senate floor last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOSH HAWLEY: We do need an investigation into irregularities, fraud. We do need a way forward together. We need election security reforms. I bet my friends on the other side of the aisle don't disagree with that.\n\nINSKEEP: Which was a common theme of the people who supported the president here. They didn't repeat the president's lies quite so much as just saying, look; there are allegations we should investigate. But this is an obvious cynical ploy. Why do you think a large part of the party was addicted to that?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. And to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. The president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. These things are decided in the courts and at the state level. And to go on the Senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. They wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.\n\nAfter the insurrection, Hawley and Cruz and the rest had every opportunity and every reason to say, this has gone far enough. And the fact that they plowed forward and pushed it into the middle of the night still, I thought, was a disgrace to the institution and, frankly, a disgrace to the Republican Party.\n\nINSKEEP: So Mitch McConnell now becomes the minority leader, but I'm not even sure that's exactly the right term when it's a 50-50 Senate and Kamala Harris, the vice president, is necessary to break ties. So he will still be in a very powerful position, but not dictating the schedule of the institution. Do you think that he anticipates using his power to work with the new president, oppose the new president? What?\n\nJENNINGS: You know, I think they'll have a power-sharing agreement akin to what happened several years ago in a 50-50 Senate. Democrats will have control of the floor. It'll make it easier for Joe Biden to form his government. I don't think Republicans intend to try to stop Biden from forming a government. But certainly, they're not going to lay down their conservative principles.\n\nAnd I think McConnell's view is in a closely divided government, policy ought to be made between the 40-yard lines. I do think he considers Joe Biden a friend. He was the only Senate Republican to go to Beau Biden's funeral. I think he thinks there are areas where they can work together. And after what happened yesterday...\n\nINSKEEP: About 10 seconds.\n\nJENNINGS: ...I hope it was a wake-up call to everybody in Washington that living in this fantasy alternate reality has to stop because there are real consequences.\n\nINSKEEP: Republican strategist Scott Jennings, it's always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.\n\nJENNINGS: Thanks, Steve.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHRISTIAN SCOTT'S DANZIGER)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

How The Trump Campaign Weakened The Republican Platform On Aid To Ukraine\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images Sergei Ilnitsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the questions raised over the course of this year's presidential race is about how a President Trump would deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne reason to wonder: the Republican Party platform's new language on policy towards Ukraine.\n\nWhen Republican Party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in Cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of then-presumptive nominee Donald Trump on most issues — except when it came to a future Republican administration's stance on Ukraine.\n\nIt started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U.S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian government, which is fighting a separatist insurrection backed by Russia. Denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.\n\nDenman is a long time GOP activist from Texas. When she presented her proposal during a platform subcommittee meeting last month, two gentleman, whom Denman said were part of the Trump campaign, came over, looked at the language, and asked that it be set aside for further review.\n\nShe says after further discussion the pair had to make some calls and clear it. She says they found the language was still too strong.\n\nThe Trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change Denman's proposal. It went from calling on the U.S. to provide Ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.\n\nIt's more than semantics. Many Republicans have been demanding the Obama administration provide a more robust response to Russia's incursions in Ukraine.\n\nDenman was steam rolled, said Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC, think tank, who believes the language the Trump campaign approved is weaker. And she says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.\n\nHaring was referring to Trumps appearance on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos last month, when Trump said Vladimir Putin is not going to go into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he's not going to go into Ukraine.\n\nOf course, Russia did go into Ukraine when it invaded Crimea two years ago and backed separatist fighters in other parts of the country. Trump later said that he meant Putin would not go into Ukraine on his watch, if he were President.\n\nStill, that comment raised eyebrows, especially combined with his campaign chairman Paul Manafort's past work for deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally.\n\nAnother GOP delegate on the platform committee, Rachel Hoff, is a national security analyst with the American Action Forum and believe the final platform language signals that a Trump administration would refuse to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine.\n\nThis puts Trump out of step certainly with Republican leadership but I would also say mainstream conservative foreign policy or national security opinion, Hoff said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have approved providing arms to the Ukrainian government but the White House has resisted, saying that it would only encourage more bloodshed.\n\nIt's a rare Obama administration policy that the Trump campaign seems to agree with.
Former Defense Sec. William Cohen On Trump's 'Tough' Foreign Policy Rhetoric\n\nFormer Defense Secretary and GOP Sen. William Cohen talks with Steve Inskeep about the Trump administration's approach to the world, as reflected in recent actions and phone calls with world leaders.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nLet's try to make sense of the way President Trump talks about other countries.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nRussia is seen as undermining U.S. interests around the world, but the president speaks of a new and better relationship.\n\nINSKEEP: Australia is among the most vital U.S. allies, and the president harangued the prime minister by phone.\n\nMARTIN: Then there's Iran, China and North Korea. The president talks of getting tougher on all of them.\n\nINSKEEP: And when North Korea talked of testing ballistic missiles that could reach the United States, Trump tweeted, it won't happen. That got former Clinton-era Defense Secretary William Cohen wondering what step is next.\n\nWILLIAM COHEN: Well, it's one thing to talk tough about North Korea. The question is does the president have a policy in mind in terms of how he's going to alter the conduct that is currently being carried on because you can't tell what the North Korean leader might do in response to either verbal or rhetorical threats coming from the administration. So you have to take care.\n\nINSKEEP: Cohen is Republican, once a senator from Maine, and he worries about possible Russian influence on the president. He says President Trump's hints at dropping sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine could undermine longtime alliances.\n\nCOHEN: It may be that President Trump is fulfilling his negotiating strategy by setting out an extreme position and then having it walk back to something that's more responsible. If it is and it works, OK, he'll get credit for that. But to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.\n\nINSKEEP: You're saying that he could inadvertently encourage Russian aggression, inadvertently encourage North Korean aggression because those countries might get the idea that the United States is not really truly standing behind its allies.\n\nCOHEN: Or they may fear that he's about to take preemptive action, in which case they might try to preempt that. What I'm saying is that the president of the United States needs to take more care about what is said and how it's said.\n\nINSKEEP: I think we could recite the White House defense ourselves now. Why are you so bothered by this? It's refreshing the way that he talks. He's speaking his mind. People like that. What's wrong with that line of thinking?\n\nCOHEN: Well, it takes a long time to build an alliance. It can be destroyed very quickly. And it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what I would call, like a blind Samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of World War II. Those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera. If you take down the pillars, what replaces it?\n\nINSKEEP: Is the danger of war involving the United States greater than it was?\n\nCOHEN: Well, you have people like former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry now writing that his biggest fear is we're going to have a nuclear explosion in his lifetime. That's worrisome.\n\nINSKEEP: Why would that be more likely?\n\nCOHEN: Well, because the notion of nuclear weapons has been what we call normalized - this is just another weapon.\n\nINSKEEP: Remarks that the president made while campaigning.\n\nCOHEN: Yeah. The notion that proliferation of nuclear weaponry may be in the overall interests of the world I think contravenes every notion that we've had since the bomb was created.\n\nINSKEEP: I want to be as clear as we can that the president, I think, if you talk about inviting Japan to get nuclear weapons, he said different things. I think he may have even denied that he ever said the thing that he had in fact previously said. So he seems to have backed off. But it sounds like you're just arguing that that uncertainty about what the president means is the problem.\n\nCOHEN: The uncertainty and the notion that is so cavalierly discussed. With the amount of nuclear weaponry in existence today, the life of this planet is at stake. So it's really incumbent on all of us to find ways to prevent something accidental from taking place because the consequences are existential for us.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the president's tough talk to adversaries or potential enemies really that much different than other presidents? I'm thinking about the way that President Obama, before the Iran nuclear deal, made a blanket statement - Iran's not going to get a nuclear weapon. It would have been hard to mistake that as anything but a threat.\n\nCOHEN: Well, you have to put it in the context of President Obama and how he conducted himself throughout his eight years of the presidency. Every instinct on his part was to find ways not to talk belligerently or to take action. In fact, Ronald Reagan talked tough as well, but people had a sense of how Ronald Reagan was going to govern. President Trump comes in with no government experience in a - and accustomed to communicating in a manner which doesn't lend itself to accountability. So is this a way to conduct policy? I don't think so. But, you know, he's president and we're not.\n\nINSKEEP: William Cohen was a Republican senator and defense secretary under President Bill Clinton.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

The Republican Party After Trump\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nJust a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.\n\nWhat is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you.\n\nSIMON: I feel like I have to put it this bluntly. Has the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ed Brooke become the party of the Proud Boys and Confederate flags and racism?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.\n\nSIMON: But before you go on, Washington Post/ABC poll says nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want to follow Trump's lead.\n\nCOSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.\n\nSIMON: From your point of view, Mr. Costello, does the Republican Party need to renounce Donald Trump?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.\n\nAnd some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.\n\nSIMON: And - well, I have to ask, Mr. Costello, and I know polls can go up and down, but if more than half of the people who identify themselves as Republicans say the party ought to support Donald Trump, after all that's happened, he's still a Republican. Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?\n\nCOSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.\n\nBut to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.\n\nSIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?\n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.\n\nTo me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.\n\nAnd so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.\n\nSIMON: Ryan Costello is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Thanks so much, sir.\n\nCOSTELLO: Thank you very much. Take care.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

For These Families, Vouchers Bring A Needed Change\n\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\n\nDorothy, of Spring Hill, Fla., has a 15-year-old son with spina bifida and developmental delays, and her 13-year-old daughter is, she says, mildly autistic. Neither was happy at public school.\n\nMy son was in a lockdown classroom with gang members. It was a bad situation. I was afraid he was going to get hurt, Dorothy says. My daughter was getting bullied because she spoke out of turn or would get upset easily. Twenty kids in a classroom was a lot for her.\n\nToday, Dorothy is homeschooling her son and daughter with the help of a novel item on the school choice menu: the Gardiner Scholarship. This voucher program, created in 2014, can be used by students with specific disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. It has grown rapidly and is now used by 7,000 Florida students.\n\nA controversial education bill now before Florida's governor, Rick Scott, would add $30 million to the program's budget, amid other expansions to school choice.\n\nUsing the Gardiner, which provides an average $10,000 for each child, Dorothy has been able to purchase tablet computers, a camera, a telescope, books, online courses and other supplies and equipment to customize a curriculum for both teenagers.\n\nThey are doing better than I ever could have imagined, says Dorothy (we're not using her last name to protect her children's privacy). Neither take any [psychiatric] medication anymore. There are no overstimulation issues.\n\nOnly a few other states, including New Hampshire and North Carolina, support homeschoolers. Compared with charter school choice or private school vouchers, these programs give families the widest possible leeway to customize their children's education while still receiving public support to pay for it.\n\nPresident Trump has shed a spotlight on this idea. His 100-day plan mentioned redirect[ing] education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. However, some in the homeschooling movement oppose vouchers. The Home School Legal Defense Association has called them a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.\n\nEnlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR\n\nCompared with other states, Florida has some of the stricter accountability requirements for homeschooling families, whether they use the Gardiner or not. They include maintaining a portfolio of student work, which is subject to inspection at any time by the district superintendent, and submitting an annual evaluation of student work, which can take the form of a state test.\n\nThe Gardiner has an additional layer of review. Amy Graham is the senior policy director for Step Up For Students, the nonprofit which administers the Gardiner. The group's role includes verifying that the expenditures that parents submit actually serve educational needs. We've had a variety of things that have been denied, she says, such as toys or entertainment videos.\n\nI spoke with four families using the Gardiner, and all said it was working out better for them than conventional school. Ewan, 14, lives in Merritt Island on Florida's Space Coast. He has autism and a passion for science. But, he struggled to adjust to public school. He once walked out of his kindergarten class, crossing six lanes of traffic, intending to go home for lunch.\n\nThe worst part for him was the noise. I hate the sound of children being loud. I just want to rip my hair out, he says. His school tried to help, giving him headphones to amplify the teacher's voice and cancel out background sounds. But that made it even more difficult than it already was to connect with peers.\n\nBy sixth grade, Ewan was placed in a class with students who had significant cognitive challenges. But, he told his parents and his teachers in a meeting, I just want to learn what everyone else is learning. His parents took him out and enrolled him in Florida Virtual School, an online charter program. With the ability to study in peace and quiet, and rewind and re-watch lectures, his mother says his grades went from Fs and Cs to As and Bs within one marking period.\n\nAfter a few years, seeking even more customization, his parents applied for the Gardiner. Now Ewan makes his own schedule, attending astronomy lectures at nearby universities, studying German, sampling free online college courses and learning to take photographs and use his own telescope. He is blowing me away with some of the stuff he is understanding, says his mother, Alicia. And that is because of the Gardiner.\n\nThe Gardiner is not a good fit for every special-needs student. Alicia points out that $10,000 doesn't go a long way for students who might need speech, occupational or behavioral therapy on a daily or weekly basis, as Ewan did when he was younger. In Dorothy's case, her children's therapies are paid for by Medicaid, because she adopted them from medical foster care. But, a lot of parents who do have children with more complex needs are still left in limbo, Alicia says.\n\nAccepting the Gardiner prohibits families from double-dipping into services or even extracurricular activities provided at public schools, says Amy Graham at Step Up For Students. A cross-check is done to make sure they aren't enrolled in public school.\n\nAnd homeschooling is only an economic option in the first place for families in which at least one parent has a flexible schedule. Both Alicia and Dorothy work from home while supervising their teenagers.\n\nAs we pointed out previously in NPR Ed's school choice series, special-needs families who accept private school vouchers often give up their federal rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This includes the right to a Free Appropriate Public Education, or FAPE.\n\nThe same is true of the Gardiner, says Amy Graham. We have language in the Gardiner Scholarship law that says that by participating in the Gardiner Program you're not allowed to have FAPE. You're giving that up. The state will still evaluate students, but if families take them out of the system, they are no longer eligible for services.\n\nAlicia, Ewan's mother, says that's a choice that families shouldn't have to make. Florida is all about school choice, says Alicia. But it's only a choice where the choices are equally beneficial for a student. Otherwise we're being herded into a decision.\n\nStill, for families like Dorothy's and Alicia's, the tradeoff is worth it. So, too, for Tracy, a mother in Citrus County, Fla.\n\nTracy's son, now 17, has an autism diagnosis and loves computer programming. We had a long, long fight with the public schools before the Gardiner came out, she says. Often the behavioral plans weren't followed. [Other students] beat him up and threatened to kill him... The school took his assistive devices and gave them to other children.\n\nToday, Tracy says, he is studying video game design with the help of a high-speed computer and online courses, all paid for by the Gardiner.
Pentagon Considers Canceling Program That Recruits Immigrant Soldiers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Pentagon is considering pulling out of a deal it made with thousands of noncitizen recruits with specialized skills: Join the military and we'll put you on the fast track to citizenship.\n\nThe proposal to dismantle the program would cancel enlistment contracts for many of the foreign-born recruits, leaving about 1,000 of them without legal protection from deportation.\n\nThe plan under consideration is laid out in a memo from Pentagon officials to Defense Secretary James Mattis. In the memo, obtained by NPR, high-level personnel and intelligence officials cite security concerns and inadequate vetting of recruits under a program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI.\n\nThe memo also cites the potential threat posed by individuals who may have a higher risk of connections to Foreign Intelligence Services, and it refers to an elevated risk of an insider threat.\n\nThe recruitment program began in 2009 to attract immigrants with medical or language skills, such as surgeons or Arabic speakers. It allows visa holders, asylees and refugees to bypass the green card process to become U.S. citizens.\n\nThe founder of the MAVNI program, retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, said the security concerns are overblown. If you were a bad guy who wanted to infiltrate the Army, you wouldn't risk the many levels of vetting required in this program, she said.\n\nNoncitizens have had a long history in the U.S. military. Immigrants have been eligible to enlist since the Revolutionary War.\n\nThree Defense Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the memo publicly, said the Pentagon is trying to balance national security concerns with the military's needs for specialized skills immigrants can provide. In some cases, the officials said, the Army wasn't using the program as intended, putting MAVNI recruits in roles that didn't match their skills.\n\nNearly 10,000 immigrants are in the MAVNI program, principally the Army, according to the Pentagon memo. The memo divides them into four groups based on their potential security risk, as determined by their level of vetting and their access to classified information.\n\nSome already are serving in the military and have been flagged for enhanced security screenings, while others are awaiting basic training and would be separated from the military or have their enlistment contracts canceled.\n\nAbout 1,000 of the recruits who have been awaiting naturalization would be at risk of deportation because their visas have expired. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had deferred action on deportation in these cases because the soldiers were in the MAVNI program.\n\nThe program has been frozen pending further review.\n\nQuestions about the program arose last year when officials discovered that some MAVNI recruits had offered false educational credentials, according to a legal brief from the Department of Justice. The brief was filed as part of a lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's decision to freeze the program.\n\nThe Pentagon responded to the discovery of some recruits providing fake university degrees by ordering security checks on all recruits in the program and barring new enlistments.\n\nBut that screening process has overwhelmed the Army's resources. According to the Pentagon memo, those security checks have diverted already constrained Army fiscal and manpower resources from their primary roles.\n\nStock said many MAVNI recruits were left in limbo.\n\nThe Army said you can ship to basic training after you complete the background checks. But now they've canceled all the background checks so nobody can ship to basic training, she said.\n\nIn one of two ongoing lawsuits, several noncitizens recruited under MAVNI and serving in the Army Reserve have sued. They argue that they were promised an expedited path to citizenship but that the Department of Homeland Security, at the behest of the Pentagon, has failed to process their naturalization applications, as required by law.\n\nIn the other case, the plaintiffs argue the Pentagon discriminated against naturalized U.S. citizens who were denied security clearances in the first terms of their enlistment. That meant that the military careers of the MAVNI recruits were effectively stalled out because they were unable to attend officer training school, for instance.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, Kirti Tiwari, is a native of India, with a master's degree in molecular biology. He was selected as an Army nominee for NASA's astronaut program, but that plan was put on hold when Tiwari couldn't get a security clearance in his first term of enlistment.\n\nThe Pentagon has since changed that policy, but plaintiffs' attorney Neil T. O'Donnell said naturalized citizen soldiers still face discrimination because some haven't been allowed to enter basic training.\n\nIn the memo, the Pentagon acknowledges that freezing the MAVNI program and subjecting recruits to more screening could be legally problematic. For example, some of the recruits are already naturalized citizens who have been deployed around the globe. There are significant legal constraints to subjecting this population to enhanced screening without an individualized assessment of cause, the memo states.\n\nThe memo also suggests devising a public affairs strategy before canceling enlistment contracts.\n\nStock, the founder of the program, said the proposal outlined in the memo could be a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThey're subjecting this whole entire group of people to this extreme vetting, and it's not based on any individual suspicion of any of these people. They've passed all kinds of security checks already. That in itself is unconstitutional, she said.
Pompeo Won't Say Whether He Owes Yovanovitch An Apology. 'I've Done What's Right'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated on Saturday at 3:01 p.m.\n\nWith the State Department facing continued questions over the treatment of Marie Yovanovitch before she was recalled as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would not say on Friday whether he owed the career diplomat an apology.\n\nI've defended every single person on this team, Pompeo said in an interview with NPR. I've done what's right for every single person on this team.\n\nPressed on whether he could point to specific remarks in which he defended Yovanovitch, Pompeo responded, I've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.\n\nThe exchange with Mary Louise Kelly, co-host of All Things Considered, follows the release by House Democrats last week of messages suggesting that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance in the days before she was told to return to Washington from her posting in Kyiv last year.\n\nThe messages were sent between Robert Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate and fervent Trump supporter, and Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. He was indicted in October on campaign finance charges.\n\nParnas has emerged as a central figure in efforts by Giuliani to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate political rivals of Trump. That campaign is now the focus of the ongoing impeachment trial against Trump in the Senate.\n\nPossible surveillance of a U.S. ambassador\n\nThe State Department itself is now investigating the possible surveillance of Yovanovitch, who during testimony before House impeachment investigators in November said she had felt threatened by Trump. Before her recall, Yovanovitch had been accused of disloyalty by allies of the White House, and during his now-infamous July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said of Yovanovitch, She's going to go through some things.\n\nIn an interview last week with the conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, Pompeo said he never heard that Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance. In her testimony before the House, Yovanovitch said she was told by the State Department that she was being recalled because of concerns about her security.\n\nPompeo has come under criticism — including, at times, from career diplomats in his own department — for failing to more forcefully defend Yovanovitch in the face of political attacks. During testimony before impeachment investigators, for example, Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, said he resigned from the department in part over what he interpreted to be a lack of public support for Department employees.\n\nI'm not going to comment on things that Mr. McKinley may have said, Pompeo said on Friday. But he dismissed the suggestion that a shadow foreign policy involving Ukraine was in place.\n\nThe Ukraine policy has been run from the Department of State for the entire time that I have been here, and our policy was very clear, Pompeo said.\n\nImmediately after the questions on Ukraine, the interview concluded. Pompeo stood, leaned in and silently glared at Kelly for several seconds before leaving the room.\n\nA few moments later, an aide asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo's private living room at the State Department without a recorder. The aide did not say the ensuing exchange would be off the record.\n\nInside the room, Pompeo shouted his displeasure at being questioned about Ukraine and asked Kelly to identify the country on a map, which she did. He used repeated expletives, according to Kelly, and asked, Do you think Americans care about Ukraine? He then said, People will hear about this.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Pompeo disputed NPR's account of the interaction.\n\nNPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record, he said. It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, NPR Senior Vice President for News Nancy Barnes said, Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran\n\nThe interview began with a series of questions about the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. Pompeo defended the president's maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, saying it is absolutely working.\n\nThis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. And the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program, Pompeo said in reference to the international agreement signed by Iran, the U.S., the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in 2015. It was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off.\n\nAs the nation's chief diplomat, Pompeo has played a central role in shaping the president's more aggressive posture toward Iran. It's a policy Pompeo has described as reestablishing deterrence.\n\nThe policy has taken many forms. Less than two weeks after Pompeo was sworn in as secretary of state in 2018, Trump announced the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. The announcement was followed by the reinstatement of steep economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nUnder Pompeo, the State Department has also designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time the U.S. has given that label to the branch of another government.\n\nYet perhaps no action has been more controversial than the administration's decision this month to launch the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's influential Quds Force, outside the airport in Baghdad. While the administration has declined to offer specifics about the intelligence that prompted the strike, Pompeo has defended the president's order, saying it was carried out in response to an imminent threat of attack on U.S. embassies.\n\nFor days, the killing revived fears of an all-out war. Iran retaliated with strikes against two bases housing American troops in Iraq. No Americans died in the attack, though the U.S. military later revealed that 34 service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nTensions have since eased, but the episode has renewed questions about whether the president's maximum pressure campaign has emboldened Tehran. Since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, Iran has shot down a U.S. drone, targeted oil tankers in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, and been blamed for a debilitating attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nAt the same time, Iran has stepped away from key provisions of the nuclear deal. In an interview this month with NPR, the country's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said all limits on centrifuges used to enrich uranium are now suspended.\n\nHe's blustering, Pompeo said in Friday's interview. This is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today.\n\nThe secretary declined, however, to detail specifics of the administration's policy for preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, saying only, We'll stop them.\n\nPompeo would not say whether direct U.S. engagement is taking place with Iran but did say the administration has built a coalition that's working to put pressure on Iran to end its missile program, its processing of uranium and the reprocessing of plutonium.\n\nHe said the U.S. has also raised the cost for Iran's use of force through proxy groups in the Middle East.\n\nThis is beginning to place real choices in front of the Iranian regime, Pompeo said. You can see in the protests inside of Iran. You can see the Iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. All the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the American people are coming to fruition as a direct result of President Trump's strategy.\n\nHe would not comment on whether a new deal is being developed in order to prevent Tehran from acquiring a weapon, but instead said, The economic, military and diplomatic deterrence that we have put in place will deliver that outcome.\n\nThe Iranian leadership will have to make the decision about what its behavior is going to be, he said.
Despite Huge Backlogs, The Government Shutdown Halts Most Immigration Court Hearings\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP\n\nThe federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.\n\nCourt appointments scheduled during the shutdown will be reset to new dates in the future, per a notice from the Department of Justice dated Dec. 26. The only exception are courts operating in immigration detention centers, where federal immigration authorities hold immigrants pending deportation. However, court staff may not be paid while continuing to hear those cases.\n\nIn addition, some emergency motions in nondetained cases can still be filed to the judges that are working during the shutdown.\n\nShutting down the country's massive system of immigration courts will gum up an already congested judicial process, immigration judges and attorneys say.\n\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled.\n\nIn federal immigration court, judges often hear cases in quick succession, a process some have compared to hearing death penalty cases heard in traffic court settings. A swift deportation may become a death sentence if a person is forced to return to a violent homeland.\n\nEach day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in Los Angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.\n\nWe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled, she said.\n\nCalls to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.\n\nIn recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the U.S. has swelled, as processing times lagged. The average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles statistics on U.S. immigration. That's up from 430 days a decade ago.\n\nSome administration officials and immigration hard-liners have criticized long processing times as contributing to practices that allow immigrants without strong cases to stay in the U.S. for years, rather than be swiftly deported.\n\nTo try to move cases through more quickly, the Trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. However, under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. If reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.\n\nBoth policies drew criticism from judges such as Tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.\n\nIt's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration, she said, referring to President Trump's desire for funding additional barriers at U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.\n\nRescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. For others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise, said Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz.\n\nFor example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. Or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the U.S. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.\n\nEvery immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said Philadelphia immigration attorney Matthew Archambeault. In either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.\n\nThe thing I tell them is, something's going on, their hearings may not go forward, but to prepare like they're going to go forward, said Archambeault. I don't get into it too much.
COVID-19 Supply Deal Lets Vaccine Maker Earmark Doses For Employees And Their Families\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nAs the nation grapples with a slower-than-promised coronavirus vaccine rollout, one federal deal to increase factory capacity includes an unusual condition: the manufacturer would be allowed to earmark doses to vaccinate employees and their families, giving them an opportunity to skip the line that public health policymakers have been crafting for months.\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's push to make a COVID-19 vaccine available in record time, added $628 million to a federal contract with Emergent BioSolutions, a Maryland-based contract manufacturer, to advance manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine as well as therapeutics, the Department of Health and Human Services announced in June.\n\nThe company has also inked separate deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine doses for AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, all three of which are part of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nAccording to Emergent's federal contract, the company can keep a reasonable quantity of vaccines to inoculate its employees and critical subcontractors, and their respective immediate families.\n\nIt's a unique and ethically fraught clause that doesn't appear in any of the other Operation Warp Speed contracts NPR has reviewed. Although the contract doesn't explicitly state that the company will vaccinate its workers ahead of people at higher risk of COVID-19, it could have that effect. And extending vaccination to family members heightened concerns that the provision would mean delays for other people prioritized for immunization.\n\nWhile vaccine manufacturers are no doubt essential, placing their workers in the highest risk group and allowing their families to get the vaccine at the same time they do is problematic, says bioethicist Ruth Faden, the founding director of the Berman Institute for Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University. She is also a member of the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts' Working Group on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nI am unaware of any context in which the family members of a critical class of workers have been included along with that critical class, Faden says. So let's take our health workers, right? Have you heard any discussion that immediate family members of even frontline health workers should get vaccines?\n\nIt's a rhetorical question.\n\nI haven't ... and that's because it doesn't pass an ethics smell test — as much as my heart breaks for the family members of health workers who have had to worry about what their loved ones are risking, she says. There are many more people at greater risk, for whom a stronger ethical case can be made.\n\nThere's a limit on how many doses Emergent can retain, but it's been redacted from the document. The contract says the company will also have to pay for the doses.\n\nWhen asked about the clause, the federal government and Emergent say company employees and their families won't get to cut in front of other people in line for the vaccine.\n\nVaccine manufacturers should coordinate with their state for any prioritization, according to the state's plans, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told NPR in an email. The HHS spokesperson didn't answer our question about how this part of the Operation Warp Speed contract came about.\n\nIt is expected that Emergent's employees will receive COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with the vaccine distribution plans of the states in which they reside, says Emergent spokesperson Nina DeLorenzo.\n\nThe company didn't answer NPR's follow-up question: If that's so, what's the point of the clause in the contract at all? Emergent's response was a restatement of the previous answer.\n\nBased on a review of the contract clause, Ameet Sarpatwari, assistant director of Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law, says it is intended to allow employees and their family members to get vaccinated when the company wants, regardless of public health officials' vaccine rollout queue.\n\nThe only reason that clause is in there is that they considered the possibility of jumping the queue and it allows them the option of doing so, he says, adding that Emergent's insistence that it intends for its employees to wait their turn doesn't mean much.\n\nI think the federal government did a disservice to the public at large, many of whom are wondering when they are going to get their vaccine and in some cases if they are going to get the vaccine by agreeing to this clause, he says.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices worked throughout 2020 to hammer out recommendations for who should get the COVID-19 vaccine and when. The CDC recommends prioritizing health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities before vaccinating front line essential workers like firefighters, for example. States then made their own plans based on the CDC's guidance.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration said that states should immediately make COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone 65 and older as well as people with health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. That's a change over previous recommendations to prioritize certain essential workers and people over 75 years old in the next phase of vaccination.\n\nSarpatwari says companies shouldn't be able to use their contracts to jump ahead in the queue policymakers designed because the decision as to who gets this scarce resource is already so ethically fraught.\n\nEvery dose matters right now, and we're trying to get them into the hands or into the arms of the people who need it the most, he says. And there's not a strong case that these are the people who need it the most.\n\nEmergent isn't the only vaccine maker that has looked at ways for its staff and their families to get access to shots.\n\nModerna has a different plan for immunizing a range of employees and affiliates, though it doesn't appear in the company's Operation Warp Speed contract.\n\nModerna announced Dec. 29 that it would be vaccinating board members, employees, contractors and their adult household members to provide an additional layer of COVID-19 protection and to reduce the risk of absenteeism and disruption due to a COVID-19 infection in an adult household member. Participating is voluntary, paid for by Moderna and separate from the 200 million doses the federal government has already agreed to purchase.\n\nFor transparency, the Company notified appropriate health authorities about the program in advance and is participating in all relevant monitoring and reporting obligations under the Emergency Use Authorization, Moderna said in a press release.\n\nModerna employees will sidestep state vaccine prioritization plans. But instead of cutting the line, the company is creating its own separate line with a small number of additional doses not available to the general public.\n\nThe supply is in addition to the commitments to the US, so the supply actually increases the capacity and number of individuals in [the] US who can be vaccinated, and in effect speeds up vaccination for those not in Moderna's program, Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan told NPR.\n\nPublic Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, first told NPR about the clause in Emergent's contract. Zain Rizvi, a law and policy researcher focused on pharmaceuticals at the organization has been combing through the Operation Warp Speed contracts for months. This one was posted as part of an Emergent financial filing. Others have been harder to come by because the federal government has been slow to respond to public records requests.\n\nIt just raises questions about the government deal-making process and what information the government is actually disclosing to the public as well, Rizvi says. I think it's a perfect example of why the government needs to be much more transparent when it comes to the terms of its deals with these giant pharmaceutical corporations.\n\nYou can contact NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin at slupkin@npr.org.
Omissions On Death Certificates Lead To Undercounting Of Opioid Overdoses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media Jake Harper/Side Effects Public Media\n\nIn a refrigerator in the coroner's office in Marion County, Ind., rows of vials await testing. They contain blood, urine and vitreous, the fluid collected from inside a human eye.\n\nIn overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.\n\nWe send that off to a toxicology lab to be tested for what we call drugs of abuse, said Alfie Ballew, deputy coroner. The results often include drugs such as cocaine, heroin, fentanyl or prescription pharmaceuticals.\n\nAfter testing, coroners typically write the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate — but not always.\n\nStandards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. As a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. The country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in February in the journal Addiction.\n\nWe have a real crisis, and one of the things we need to invest in, if we're going to make progress, is getting better information, said Christopher Ruhm, the author of the paper and a health economist at the University of Virginia.\n\nData from death certificates move from coroners and medical examiners to states and eventually the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes reports on overdose counts across the U.S. According to the CDC, more than 42,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2016, a 30 percent increase from the year before.\n\nBut that number is only as good as the data states submit to the CDC. Ruhm said the real number of opioid overdose deaths is closer to 50,000. He came to the higher estimate through an analysis of overdoses that weren't linked to specific drugs.\n\nOn a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. In some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said Ruhm. In the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.\n\nSome states do worse than others. In 14 states, between 20 and 48 percent of all overdose deaths weren't attributed to specific drugs in 2016, according to a breakdown from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nMany overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, Ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. According to Ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, Indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. He estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.\n\nIn some states such as Indiana, independent county coroners investigate deaths. Coroners are usually elected, and they aren't necessarily medical professionals. Other states, though, have medical examiners, who are doctors. Some even have a chief medical examiner who oversees death investigations for the whole state.\n\nStates that have centralized oversight with medical examiners tend to do better than those with coroners, said Ruhm.\n\nIn some places, death investigators don't list substances on a death certificate because they haven't tested for them. Brad Ray, a policy researcher at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said toxicology reports cost hundreds of dollars each, which could strain county budgets.\n\nAdditionally, toxicology reports are currently optional for Indiana coroners. So if you're not required to pay for it, and you're not required to report it, why would you? said Ray.\n\nIndiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and Gov. Eric Holcomb is expected to sign it. Starting in July, coroners will have to run toxicology screens and report the results to the state health department. The state will also help cover the added costs.\n\nMore accurate data will likely make the opioid problem look worse as the numbers go up. But Ray said realistic data could help the state access federal funds to tackle the opioid epidemic and keep better track of drug problems.\n\nSo we can see when trends are happening. We can see when there tend to be increases in cocaine and meth and decreases in opioids, if that happens, said Ray.\n\nMarion County's Ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. Her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.\n\nWe'll say 'drug overdose' or 'drug intoxication,' and then we identify the drugs, she said. So if it's five drugs that have caused or contributed to the death, then we put those five drugs down.\n\nBallew plans to travel the state and train other coroners to do it the same way.\n\nThis story was produced by Side Effects Public Media, a reporting collaborative focused on public health, in partnership with NPR and Kaiser Health News.

Twitter Suspends Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Account\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTwitter locked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene out of her account on the social media platform on Sunday, citing violations of a company policy that it recently used to remove thousands of QAnon-related accounts. The suspension is in effect for 12 hours.\n\nGreene has repeatedly endorsed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which has sought to portray President Trump as being undermined by a deep-state cabal.\n\nWhen reached on Sunday, a Twitter spokesperson told NPR that the Georgia Republican's account has been temporarily locked out for multiple violations of our civic integrity policy.\n\nThe company's policy was updated after the recent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — a deadly event during which Greene and others were seen not wearing face masks in a secure room where a crowd of people were sheltering.\n\nGreene's account is still viewable to the public. The newly elected representative's most recent messages on the platform repeat false claims that elections that resulted in Trump's defeat and key Republican losses in the Senate were flawed. Key election officials in Georgia, she said, had been begged by Republicans to fix our elections.\n\nTwitter affixed a warning notice to Greene's message about the recent national election stating, This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can't be replied to, Retweeted or liked to a risk of violence. Those limits on engagement were introduced as part of the social media company's new approach to messages that are deemed to violate its civic integrity policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Twitter announced that it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts that were used to share content about QAnon.
Biden's Plan To Release More Vaccine Is A Gamble. Is It Worth The Risk?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is planning to take a dramatic step aimed at increasing the amount of vaccine available to states.\n\nHis transition team says he'll change a Trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.\n\nInstead, the Biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. For people who've gotten initial shots, the Biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.\n\nThe two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.\n\nAccording to CDC, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.\n\nThe President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.\n\nSome public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health — who advises both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration on the federal COVID-19 response — tells NPR there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.\n\nThe Biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. They are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. They feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.\n\nThe Biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.\n\nWe have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, Biden's incoming press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing Friday. The president-elect has said he will use the Defense Production Act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.\n\nHowever, Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the Trump administration, defends its current policy.\n\nIf President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.\n\nA key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.\n\nThe head of the Association of Immunization Managers, Claire Hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. The goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. Get it, thaw it, give it. [Then] order the second dose. Don't try to store it at CDC, don't try to store it at McKesson.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that this is a good move. He says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.\n\nAs the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, Lipsitch says.\n\nThere is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. This is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.\n\nThe danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. It could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.\n\nRasmussen and others worry that a weak immune response could actually lead to the virus developing new mutations that are even more dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement earlier this week confirming the importance of the booster shots.\n\nBut many approve of the Biden policy announced Friday.\n\nThis strategy makes tons of sense, Dr. Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco wrote in an email to NPR. We know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.\n\nDr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials or ASTHO, calls the Biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. The big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.\n\nOur hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.\n\nIf it turns out there are production issues down the line, the Biden decision could be reversed, suggests Julie Swann, a supply chain expert and professor at North Carolina State University.\n\nI think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [If] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.\n\nPien Huang contributed to this report.
6 Takeaways From President Biden's Inauguration\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden.\n\nThat's going to take some getting used to after these past four years.\n\nThe new president was sworn in Wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. Biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing Americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the U.S. faces, as he sees it.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Biden's inauguration:\n\n1. A starkly different tone was set.\n\nIf there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that Biden struck. Gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of Donald Trump. Instead, America saw a staid and humble President Biden. Instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.\n\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, Biden said. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.\n\nFor a significant portion of the country, Biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the Trump presidency. Some Republicans even praised his speech. For another large group of Americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.\n\nOverall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to COVID-19 and threats, it seemed like Washington was headed for something of a return to normal.\n\nFor a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the U.S. Capitol on the first three Wednesdays of this January: one of the Jan. 6 violence, one of Trump's impeachment and then one of Biden's inauguration.\n\n2. Real unity will be tough to come by.\n\nTrying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, Biden did something Trump rarely did — reach out to those who didn't vote for him. And he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all.\n\nTo all those who did not support us, Biden said, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n\nCertainly, this was no Trump American carnage speech. But tone is one thing, and policy is another.\n\nA return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but only very narrowly. Biden will likely need Republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.\n\nAnd it won't solve the problem of the tens of millions of Trump supporters who are fed and believe a daily diet of false information — and who make up the base of the Republican Party.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n3. Biden laid out his priorities.\n\nSpeaking of those priorities, Biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in America. They include addressing COVID-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. He is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address.\n\nBiden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. But you can bet that Republicans will find plenty to disagree with Democrats about in how to solve those issues. And what of unity then? More importantly, what of solving those issues when Biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of Republican opposition?\n\nBiden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more.\n\nBut there's only so far those executive orders can go.\n\n4. Truth matters again.\n\nWhen hearing of Trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many Trump supporters dismissed the criticism that Trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: Oh, come on. All politicians lie.\n\nWell, not like what was seen these past four years. Trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to The Washington Post. That's an average of 20 per day.\n\nWhat usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. Then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. But Trump could not be shamed.\n\nThe news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. And Biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. But there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.\n\n5. Inaugurations may have changed permanently.\n\nBiden got out of the presidential limo and walked hand in hand with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, to the White House. For a brief moment, in a tight shot on television, it could have all looked like any other inauguration.\n\nBut it was not. The walk was drastically curtailed and more heavily guarded compared with past presidential inaugurations. And while there were some people on the street during the walk, there weren't throngs of people lining the streets.\n\nIt's very likely that inaugurations as we knew them have changed permanently. There may be a return of people to the National Mall and even a parade when the coronavirus pandemic finally clears.\n\nBut from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events.\n\n6. The presidency is overwhelming — for anyone.\n\nDespite his decades serving as a senator in Washington and even his eight years as vice president, Biden was clearly moved by the reality of his new position.\n\nTrump even appeared cowed Wednesday by leaving it. On Trump's exit from the White House, he stopped to talk to reporters. He looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind — and even thanked the media.\n\nAfter walking up to the White House, Biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. He then hugged his wife and held the embrace. They took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.
Gov. Wolf just set a lofty climate goal. What will it take to get there?\n\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf kicked off the new year with an ambitious climate change goal: reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.\n\nPennsylvania is the nation's fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. If cutting emissions to arrive at Wolf's targets is achievable, it will require a host of strategies.\n\n\n\nOne involves far more electric vehicles on the road. In the Pittsburgh area, less than 1 percent of car sales are electric, said Sarah Olexsak, manager of transportation electrification for Duquesne Light.\n\nThe power utility began greening its own fleet in 2017, purchasing electric sedans and trucks to use in lieu of ones powered by gasoline or diesel.\n\nStanding next to one of the electric trucks recently, Olexsak paused to listen to a faint stream of white noise emanating from it.\n\nThis is all you're going to hear, the sound of the fan and the batteries, she said.\n\nThat's less of a nuisance for residents when workers are fixing nearby lines. Plus, there are zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nDuquesne Light is also working with parking authorities and local businesses to help install chargers for the public, offering guidance on where to place them and whether to require payment for their use.\n\nYour car is going to sit eight-plus hours a day at a work site, Olexsak said. It's a great place to charge up.\n\nBetter planning and incentives to increase electric vehicle use would result in significant greenhouse gas reductions for Pennsylvania. That's one suggestion for cutting emissions included in the state's most recent blueprint for addressing climate change, the draft of its Climate Action Plan released by the Department of Environmental Protection every three years.\n\nWolf based his new climate goals off models identified in the plan, which use 2005 as a baseline year for emission levels. As coal-fired power plants shut down amid competition from cleaner natural gas and renewables, Pennsylvania is already halfway to his 2025 target.\n\nMaking that goal is feasible, said Carnegie Mellon University professor Jay Apt, a director of the school's electric industry center.\n\nWolf has joined other governors in setting similar short- and long-range targets.\n\nThe idea of having a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2050 will inform choices that we make now because energy investments are very long-lived, Apt said.\n\nA gas power plant, for example, will operate for decades.\n\nThat's a big shadow that an investment today casts, Apt said. Having a goal now that articulates out 30 years into the future is quite reasonable.\n\nMany in the environmental community were glad to see the governor set ambitious targets.\n\nIt's absolutely the goal we need, but the market by itself is not going to get us there. We really need to do it through policy, said Mark Szybist, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nEstablishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a limit on emissions is one option. The state could also boost its Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, a law that requires a certain percentage of the state's power mix come from renewables. Those ideas will be tough to get through a Republican-led Legislature.\n\nLawmakers this year are expected to debate whether to rescue the state's nuclear industry. Like coal, it's struggling to compete with gas and renewables. Nuclear reactors provide Pennsylvania's largest source of carbon-free power, but several are slated to close prematurely.\n\nKeeping those nuclear power plants operating as they are now is a very good low-pollution strategy, Apt said.\n\nIn announcing his climate goals, Wolf did not say if he would support such a plan. He did indicate he wants to go after more natural gas development while striving for lower emissions.\n\nSzybist with the NRDC said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. Gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.\n\nThe emission reductions we've seen the past few years, I think are not durable, Szybist said. They're vulnerable to going back up again unless we figure out energy policy that will really drive development of renewables.\n\nThe state has made progress on some policy fronts, joining a group of states developing a clean transportation policy, cracking down on methane leaks and releasing a plan for greater solar energy development.\n\nPolicy is most important to drive all this, but businesses and citizens can step up as well, Szybist said.\n\nDEP's draft climate action plan, which is expected to be finalized soon, accounts for what further action the state could take. It includes policies tied to nuclear, renewables, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and more options for emission reductions.\n\nYou're not going to reach the goal with just these strategies, said Robert Graff of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, who's also a member of the state's climate change advisory committee.\n\nThey only get Pennsylvania halfway to its 2050 target. But, he said, the plan is a starting point. He said he believes the governor's decision to announce those goals will get people to give the plan more consideration. The state received a federal grant to help develop it, and Graff said it's more thorough than in previous years.\n\nMaybe, technological advances in energy storage or capturing and storing carbon emissions will make an 80 percent drop easier to achieve, he said. It's also possible that at some point, the federal government could step in with sweeping policies aimed at reducing emissions, or that the public will become more willing to change carbon-intense habits by driving or flying less, for example.\n\nYou have to walk a narrow path between what's effective and what's economically feasible and also what will have less disruption to the way people like to live, Graff said.\n\nEditor's Picks
After Mass Shootings, Action On Gun Legislation Soars At State Level\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nThere's an all-too familiar fight that takes place after horrible events like those in Dallas and Orlando, centered around firearms and how — or even whether — to regulate them.\n\nGun-control advocates and Democrats call for tighter regulations. Gun-rights groups and Republicans argue that blame shouldn't be put on inanimate objects, but on the people pulling the trigger. Both sides dig in. And it seems that nothing changes.\n\nA frustrated Dallas Police Chief David Brown challenged federal lawmakers to debate gun control earlier this week, saying, Do your job. We're doing ours.\n\nState Vs. Federal\n\nWhile it's true that Congress has failed to pass new gun laws after mass shootings, despite Democrat-staged sit-ins, presidential pleas and other vocal efforts, the sense that nothing changes is wrong. At the state level, a lot changes in terms of laws.\n\nMore than 20,400 pieces of gun-related legislation have been proposed following mass shooting events in the past 25 years. Of those bills, more than 3,000 have become law, according to a working paper recently released by researchers at the Harvard Business School.\n\nIt's not that nothing changes after a mass shooting, says Deepak Malhotra, one of the paper's authors. A lot of the action on [gun control] happens across states instead of at the federal level.\n\nThe researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation — whether it tightens or loosens gun laws — depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.\n\nIf you have a Republican legislature in your state and you have a mass shooting, the net effect if you look at the actual bills that get passed is there's a significant increase in bills that loosen gun restrictions, Malhotra says.\n\nDemocrat-controlled states showed no such effect. Bills that tightened gun regulations did get proposed after mass shootings, just not at a noticeably higher rate.\n\nA good example of this is California, where the state's governor recently signed six gun-control bills into law, many of which were in response to the shooting in San Bernardino, where 14 people were killed.\n\nWe've covered a large spectrum when it comes to gun safety measures, says state Sen. Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, from high-capacity cartridges to domestic violence and temporary restraining orders.\n\nSix gun laws sounds like a lot, but for comparison, California passed 11 gun-related laws in 2013 and approved four others in 2014. It's not unusual for the deeply blue state to pass a number of laws tightening restrictions on firearms in a given year.\n\n'Instruments Of Defense'\n\nRepublican-controlled states are different. Gun-related legislation doesn't come up as often as it does in Democrat-led states, and when it does, the aim often isn't to tighten regulations, but to loosen them.\n\nTake Tennessee: Last July, a gunman killed four people and injured three more at a military recruiting station and a Navy building in Chattanooga — two places that were gun-free zones for everyone except police.\n\n[The shooting] confirmed even more the idea that gun-free zones left those servicemen and women as literally sitting ducks, says state Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden.\n\nIn response, the state has since approved five bills related to guns, including one sponsored by Holt that allows full-time employees of public universities to carry handguns on campuses, where guns were previously banned.\n\nWhen we put instruments of defense in the hands of law-abiding citizens, in my opinion, I think we see a decrease in criminal statistics, Holt says.\n\nSimilar opinions have been voiced in Florida, another Republican-controlled state, since the Orlando shooting. Nightclubs like Pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. At least one Republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in Florida.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists — similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.\n\nCertainly, it's not going to be an easy vote to win, says state Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando. But we put something forward that I believe is narrowly tailored for both parties to get behind.\n\nIt's hard to predict how the Republican-led legislatures in Florida and Texas will respond to the recent shootings. The scale of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. And the fact that the five victims of the Dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.\n\nIf history is any indicator, though, it's likely that both states will pass gun-related legislation in the coming year.
Trump Administration Proposes Major Changes To Bedrock Environmental Law\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Mone/AP Jim Mone/AP\n\nUpdated at 1:40 E.T.\n\nIn one of his most sweeping environmental proposals so far, President Trump says he wants to streamline an outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process that can delay major infrastructure projects for years.\n\nSupporters from the fossil fuel, construction, ranching and other industries welcome the move, which they've long sought. Environmental groups warn it would sideline the climate impacts of highways, pipelines and other projects, and they promise a legal challenge.\n\nThe proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which has not been updated in decades. As one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. It also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.\n\nAmerica is a nation of builders, Trump said announcing the move at the White House, whose gleaming new infrastructure used to be the envy of the world. Now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the U.S. like a Third World country. It's really sad.\n\nA key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country.\n\nUnder the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. That could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.\n\nEnvironmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.\n\nMary Neumayr, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.\n\nThis delay, she says, deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families.\n\nIndustry groups say streamlining NEPA regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. In a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.\n\nEnvironmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.\n\nThe proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to NEPA review. For example, it would exempt non-federal projects with little government funding.\n\nIn another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.\n\nThis is a clearly a conflict of interest, says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president at Center for American Progress. She was a managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration.\n\nIt's baffling that the Trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster, says Goldfuss.\n\nThe White House CEQ will collect public comments for at least 60 days before making the rule final. But there are hurdles that could keep it from taking effect.\n\nFor one thing, if Trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. Even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. And experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.\n\nThe law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,'  says Bruce Huber of Notre Dame Law School. If the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law.
A Former Immigration Judge On The Current Situation\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThe Trump administration zero tolerance policy has increased an already enormous backlog of cases for the nation's immigration courts. There are currently more than 700,000 cases pending. Paul Wickham Schmidt was an immigration judge for 13 years. He retired in 2016. Judge Schmidt joins us now. Thanks for being with us.\n\nPAUL SCHMIDT: It's my pleasure, Scott.\n\nSIMON: Is the immigration court system up to handling even more cases?\n\nSCHMIDT: No, they're not even up to handling the ones they have now.\n\nSIMON: Well, help us understand that. How long does it take, for example, for a case to work its way through the courts?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, when I retired, I was setting cases on the last day - I was on the bench June 30 of 2016. I think I was setting them for the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. I've heard they have more judges now, so maybe they've brought some of that in. But I think it's probably still 2020, 2021.\n\nSIMON: And why?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, there's too many cases and not enough judges. And the dockets have been mismanaged by the Department of Justice over the last three administrations - something I call aimless docket reshuffling.\n\nSIMON: What's that?\n\nSCHMIDT: Each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. And therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. And the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. So some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. And, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. But sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. So that disrupts dockets.\n\nSIMON: President Trump rejected a call for more immigration judges this week. He said, quote, we don't want judges. We want security on the border. How do you react?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, I don't think he understands the law and the constitution. According to the Supreme Court, everybody in the United States, regardless of status, has a right to due process under law. And you're not going to get due process from more border patrol agents. You're going to have to get judges of some type - give individuals fair hearings before an impartial decision-maker.\n\nSIMON: So the piercing cries of children that so many of us heard this week - those youngsters might not have the cases of their parents heard for - what? - two, three, four more years?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, that is if they could get out of detention. But, of course, the administration has announced that they're going to detain 100 percent of the new arrivals who cross at a place other than a port of entry. And they're going to expedite their cases. In fact, the president, as part of his executive order, ordered a new round of aimless docket reshuffling, which means those cases will go to the top of the front of the line. Other cases that are ready to be heard will go to the back of the line. And judges that are handling dockets here and in other places will, in all likelihood, be moved to the border to hear these cases leaving nobody to hear the cases on their dockets - in Arlington, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, wherever they regularly sit. So it will be a total mess in my view.\n\nSIMON: Retired Immigration Judge Paul Wickham Schmidt, thanks so much.\n\nSCHMIDT: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Biden Surrogate John Kerry: '70 Is The New 50'\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry has been making this joke at the last few events for Joe Biden: 70 is the new 50.\n\nKerry, a Biden surrogate, is alluding to the belief among some Democrats that the party should pick a nominee younger than the 77-year-old — and is batting it down.\n\nBut Biden draws a lot of his support from older voters, and at his events over the last few days, the crowds have been filled more with baby boomers than millennials.\n\nThat was largely the case Sunday when Biden kicked off his final full day of campaigning at Clarke University on the banks of the Mississippi River in Dubuque.\n\nAround the corner from the campus snack shop, Nicholas Wade, a freshman, wanted to see Biden in person, but he's supporting Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThey say in the primary, vote with your heart. And I like Elizabeth Warren's ideas the best, he said. But it's tough, because I think Joe Biden has the best chance of winning in 2020. I think sometimes he does struggle to connect with younger voters.\n\nRoss Benjamin, 30, traveled here this morning from just across the border in Wisconsin. He's planning to vote for Biden because he thinks Biden has the best shot to win over moderates and Republicans. But Benjamin says if he weren't worried about all that, he'd rather pick Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who last night packed an arena for a partylike rally featuring the band Vampire Weekend.\n\nI've seen both Warren and Bernie, and they really bring the energizing core to our generation, he said. If it wasn't about electability, it would be one of them two. I want someone who can actually get Donald Trump out of office, so I guess I'm sacrificing self-interest for the bigger picture.\n\nPeter Jarka-Sellers, 23, drove down from Minnesota last night to see Biden. He describes Biden as a good, decent guy whose life experiences really resonate with him. And he thinks Biden's policy platform is more realistic.\n\nWe're not going to get to do any of the things we want to do if [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is blocking them, and I think Biden will help us pick up some of the key Senate seats, so I'm trying to think how we can get the most done, he said. All of these people are saying stuff that's further than Congress will let them do. You're not going to get more than a public option [on health care].\n\nTucker LaBelle, a sophomore at Clarke, says he used to swing Republican and now is undecided between Sanders, 78, and Biden.\n\nA lot of people will say we need someone younger in the White House, but with the experience and history they have, it's kind of a no-brainer. They're legends, he said. I just like Bernie a little more over Biden because of the way he handles himself in public. I'm a communications major, and I focus on how people speak, and at that last debate especially, I saw a lot more personality out of Bernie.\n\nAt campaign events, Biden has heavily featured freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer as a surrogate, who in 2018 flipped a Republican district here in eastern Iowa at age 29.\n\nWhen it comes to Iowa, it is about the future of our state as well, not just our country, Finkenauer told NPR in an interview after the event. And making sure we have somebody like Joe who embodies the values I grew up with here in Iowa, where you care about your neighbors and you step up for folks, and you also get things done. And that matters — I don't care what generation you are. To see somebody who has done that his entire career, who has worked for working families, and that means everything to me, and that's what we've been talking about on the trail.
CEOs' Dilemma: Supporting Trump's Agenda, Opposing His Behavior\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUnder Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank set off a social media firestorm last February when he voiced some overly positive words about the new administration of President Trump.\n\nTo have such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset for this country. I think people should really grab that opportunity, said Plank, whose company makes sports apparel.\n\nOn Monday, Plank became the latest corporate CEO to publicly cut ties with the president, giving up his seat on a White House advisory council on manufacturing amid criticism over the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.\n\nThere is no place for racism or discrimination in this world, Plank said in a tweet.\n\nOthers quitting the council are Merck's Kenneth Frazier and Intel's Brian Krzanich. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry group, also announced his departure Tuesday, tweeting, I'm resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it's the right thing for me to do.\n\nAnd AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka also stepped down from the council.\n\nI think these leaders are waking up to the fact their continued silence in the face of mounting evidence of immorality is tantamount to consent, said Nicholas Pearce, clinical associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe departures underscore the dilemma facing corporate chief executives at a highly polarized and partisan time, said David Ulrich, professor of business at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and a partner at the consulting firm RBL Group.\n\nThey may share Trump's pro-business agenda, but find it difficult to ignore his personal behavior, Ulrich said.\n\nHow do you begin to manage the balance between the person and the policy? And I can imagine these CEOs are really struggling to find that right balance between those two things, Ulrich said.\n\nHe noted that corporations have a big stake in policy decisions being made right now, and giving up a seat at the table means having much less influence in Washington.\n\nIt's pretty easy for a CEO to say, 'These are my values. You violated them.' But the CEOs who are smart know, 'Once I back out of that opportunity to shape policy, the voice that I could have had is now lost,'  he added.\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday that he would have no trouble replacing the departed members of the advisory council and dismissed them as grandstanders.\n\nAnd some high-profile companies have said they are staying on the council.\n\nWe must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it, said Alex Gorsky, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering, and we will remain active champions for these efforts, said a spokesman for Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison.\n\nThe decision to leave is harder for some companies than others.\n\nAmong those staying on the council are the CEOs of several major companies that have substantial federal government contracts, including Lockheed Martin and United Technologies.\n\nGiven Trump's tendency to hit back hard against anyone who crosses him, such companies may be especially reluctant to anger the White House.\n\nIn this environment, it's easier for an executive to release a boilerplate statement condemning hatred than it is to open him or herself or their company up to the president's Twitter-ranting, Pearce said.
California Lawmakers Prepare For Trump, Hire Ex-Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nDemocratic leaders of the California Legislature signaled their intention Wednesday to fight any challenges to state policies by the incoming administration of Donald Trump by hiring as outside legal counsel former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe announcement came in a joint statement issued by California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\n\nWith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead, said the lawmakers.\n\nHolder will assist Gov. Jerry Brown, yet-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Javier Becerra and the Legislature to protect California's economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration. This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great.\n\nThe move comes amid escalating rhetoric from California leaders, all Democrats, since the election in which Trump lost the state by more than 4 million votes.\n\nLast month Rendon called the Trump administration a major existential threat. Days later, Brown delivered a full-throated warning that California has no intention of reversing its climate change policies.\n\nWe've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight, Brown told a group of scientists in San Francisco. We're ready to defend. California is no stranger to this fight.\n\nHolder was attorney general in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015. He's currently a partner in the law firm Covington & Burling. According to the Associated Press, the firm will be paid $25,000 a month for three months starting in February. The deal will be renegotiated afterward.\n\nBut it's not going over well with Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe state's incoming attorney general has spent decades in Washington working on federal policies, said Assemblyman Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, in a statement quoted by the Sacramento Bee. It's not clear why legislative Democrats needed to hire a D.C. insider to litigate the exact same issues.\n\nIn a statement offered by de Leon's office, Holder said he was honored to help the Legislature as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California's residents and policy priorities. I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the legislature.
Treating Opioid Addiction With A Drug Raises Hope And Controversy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nScientists and doctors say the case is clear: The best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.\n\nYet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the U.S. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.\n\nOne reason is the limited availability of the treatment. But it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. A phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. While doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.\n\nNow, the White House is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. In his 2017 budget, President Obama has asked Congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.\n\nThe White House is also highlighting success stories. At the National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit held in Atlanta in March, Obama appeared on stage with Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio. Oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. She tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. I personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, Oertle said in Atlanta. I couldn't tough it out. I know some people can. I couldn't do it. This last time has been the most successful recovery for me.\n\nHer experience isn't unique.\n\nI've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says Michael Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. We wouldn't do that with any other disease. If one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nBotticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. Researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.\n\nWe have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says Dr. Marc Fishman, medical director at Maryland Treatment Centers in Baltimore. He says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. Studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.\n\nShots - Health News We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment We Found Joy: An Addict Struggles To Get Treatment Listen\n\nStill, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. Their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.\n\nFor years, Juan Ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. When you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.\n\nA friend told Ramirez about a doctor in Baltimore who prescribed Suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. He liked the way Suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. He stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. Still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. I was still an addict, he says. It was just legal.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nThat line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including David Lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in Hagerstown, Md. The home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. In addition to beds, Lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. The emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. It's what worked for Lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.\n\nWhen he started his work as a recovery advocate, Lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. Soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's Suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting Suboxone. That to me just looks like heroin, Lidz says.\n\nSo he made a decision: He wouldn't accept anyone on it.\n\nToday, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. Now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on Suboxone, Lidz says.\n\nHe worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like Charles Testerman, who came to Lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. Testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. He drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. When he couldn't afford heroin, he bought Suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. It didn't work.\n\nI was doing Suboxone in the mornings, as well as Adderall to bring myself up. Then at night, I was taking Xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, Testerman says. It was just a constant cycle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nToday, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called The Stoner Farm, Anglicized from Steiner, the name of the family who built the place. Testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. I feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. It's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n\nFishman, the addiction doctor in Baltimore, knows there are people like Testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. But, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. He wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.\n\nThis doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. But we don't have the penicillin for addiction. These are not curative medications. In having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations I think would make us more credible.

If a Wealth Tax is Such a Good Idea, Why Did Europe Kill Theirs?\n\nEnlarge this image Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNOTE: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\n\nIn late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.\n\nIt's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.\n\nThe disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.\n\nEuro Flop\n\nNormally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.\n\nIn 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.\n\nUC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.\n\nHe argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.\n\nWarren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.\n\nAlso important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.\n\nBureaucracy and the Constitution\n\nBut having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.\n\nAnd a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.\n\nWhile the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.\n\nA Local Problem with a Global Solution\n\nIt's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.\n\nHis solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

Trump Took Fight For Border Wall To El Paso — Where O'Rourke Was Ready For Him\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump took his fight for a wall to the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday night, promising a crowd in El Paso, Texas, that he would press forward for its construction — even as news was breaking in Washington that a deal reached between congressional negotiators would fall far short of his funding demands.\n\nAnd in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, Trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by Democrat Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with Democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a White House bid that could especially challenge Trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a Southern border wall.\n\nBut the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that Trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. As another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on Capitol Hill emerged with a deal Monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's Department of Homeland Security funding bill). This will fund about 55 miles of fencing.\n\nOn stage, Trump claimed he didn't know the details and didn't want to hear about it, sticking to his robust talking points on the border wall.\n\nAs I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway, he said to raucous applause, underneath Finish The Wall banners.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Fox News conducted on the sidelines of the rally, Trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: We'll see what happens. About his push for a border wall, Trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. A wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. It's a moral thing, the president also said in the interview.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. And the selection of a rally in El Paso was no accident either — Trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the U.S. border town compared to its Mexican counterpart. However, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in El Paso.\n\nTrump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.\n\nThe president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in U.S. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. Multiple polls also showed most Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.\n\nIf Trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight Saturday — though Trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.\n\nThe whole rally largely stuck to Trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his State of the Union address.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\n\nBut Trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally O'Rourke, El Paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily Democratic city. Exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, Trump claimed that O'Rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.\n\nThat may be the end of his presidential bid, Trump said, mocking O'Rourke as a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.\n\nHe's supposed to win in order to run, the president jabbed. Beto was defeated, Trump said, referring to the race against Cruz, as the president boasted of his own undefeated record in his first bid for office.\n\nAccording to NBC News, O'Rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. And Bloomberg News reported that O'Rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. At various points during his own rally, Trump claimed that 69,000 people had RSVP'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. But NBC News reported that Trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.\n\nO'Rourke directly took on Trump over border security and Trump's desire for a wall or other physical barrier. He said El Paso was a peaceful and safe city because we treat one another with dignity and respect.\n\nWe know that walls do not save lives; walls end lives, O'Rourke also told those gathered at his rally.\n\nHe also criticized the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.\n\nWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 Democratic candidate said. We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\n\nWe will not take advantage of them, O'Rourke added about immigrants. We will not send them back to certain death. We will not believe that walls can or should keep them out. Instead, we welcome them with open arms.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rudy Gutierrez/AP Rudy Gutierrez/AP\n\nTrump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. Instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.\n\nThe Democrat Party has never been more outside the mainstream. They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, Trump said. He criticized Democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.\n\nI will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country, Trump said.
Trump And China: Intentionally Provocative Or Unprepared?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, Donald Trump directed some of his strongest words toward China. He called the Chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of America's leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on China.\n\nNow, as president-elect, Trump is sounding the same notes. He caused a veritable earthquake in U.S.-China relations just by taking a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. This challenged the bedrock of U.S. relations, the One China policy, under which the U.S. officially recognizes only the government in Beijing, though it also conducts business with Taipei.\n\nAnd at his confirmation hearing last week, Trump's choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, unleashed another salvo. Though it was just one line in a nine-hour hearing, he suggested a Trump administration would be willing to wage a showdown over China's recent island building in the South China Sea.\n\nWe're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island building stops, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP\n\nSince 2013, China has built seven islands in the South China Sea. An international tribunal last year rejected China's claims to those artificial islands — and its claims to much of the South China Sea. In the meantime, China has also militarized the islands by building airstrips and installing anti-aircraft guns on them.\n\nSince Trump is not yet in office, and Tillerson hasn't yet been confirmed, it remains unclear whether Tillerson's statement was a genuine policy position or just get-tough rhetoric as Trump and his team prepare to assume power.\n\nA number of Asia analysts believe Tillerson likely misspoke or overstated the positions a Trump administration will take.\n\nWhat I think he meant was that we will not let the Chinese use these new airbases on these reclaimed islands to establish dominance in the South China Sea, says Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nGreen, a former National Security Council senior director for Asia, says the Trump administration could increase the U.S. Navy's presence in the South China Sea and the frequency of patrols — strategies the Obama administration pursued, but only to a limited degree.\n\nMy guess is that [Tillerson] was referring to options such as that — but not stating that the U.S. would blockade or interdict Chinese ships approaching those islands, says Green.\n\nGreen says the lack of clarity may be due to the lack of seasoned policy makers in the Trump transition team and the limited input from the State Department.\n\nI think the process has been less conducive to a careful and thorough consideration of exact wording than in the past, he says.\n\nThe Chinese media was less charitable in its assessment. The China Daily called Tillerson's remarks a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies.\n\nSo was David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.\n\nThis is insane and totally unenforceable, not to mention very ill-informed, ill-considered, probably not logistically feasible, and highly provocative and war-risking, he says of Tillerson's comments.\n\nTaken at face value, the remarks call for a Cuban Missile Crisis-like blockade that would prevent the Chinese from accessing the islands they claim in the South China Sea.\n\nDoing that would be no easy task for the U.S. Navy.\n\nChina's Navy has been rapidly modernizing in recent years and while it is not going to be able to defeat the U.S. necessarily, they will certainly be able to punish U.S. forces in the region in a way they couldn't before, says Avery Goldstein, director of Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe danger is that a small incident in the South China Sea could quickly escalate into a major conflict.\n\nThere is another way to look at Trump's approach so far.\n\nAlmost every recent U.S. president has said on the campaign trail that he would take a tougher stance with China. That list includes Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nThis approach is not unprecedented, says CSIS's Green. Typically, what happens in every case is that within a few months or a year or two, the policy calibrates and they go back to the norm.\n\nGoldstein, of the University of Pennsylvania, says Trump might be using tactics he learned in the business world, where you often stake out your toughest positions in the beginning.\n\nPerhaps this is just an attempt to gain bargaining leverage so that at some point, you make a deal that is better than the one you would've gotten if you'd been flexible at the beginning, he says.\n\nIt might work. Or backfire.\n\nChina has come a long way in recent years and is increasingly assertive in the international arena. President Xi Jinping is no one's idea of a pushover.\n\nThe devil, says Goldstein, is in the details. All we have so far are comments and tweets. Until they take office and formulate and implement policy, we can't be sure.\n\nNishant Dahiya is NPR's Asia editor.
Off-Duty Police Officers Investigated, Charged With Participating In Capitol Riot\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNearly 30 sworn police officers from a dozen departments attended the pro-Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol last week, and several stormed the building with rioters and are facing federal criminal charges as well as possible expulsion or other discipline.\n\nThe officers are from departments large and small. There was veteran officer in Houston, the nation's eighth-largest department; a sergeant in the small town of Rocky Mount, Va., and a group of Philadelphia transit officers.\n\nFive people were killed in the riots, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer when she attempted to breach a barricaded door inside the Capitol.\n\nHouston police officer Tam Pham, an 18-year veteran, resigned Thursday in the wake of federal charges against him, Houston Chief Art Acevedo said in a tweet. Photos emerged showing Pham inside the Capitol during the riots holding a Trump flag alongside other pro-Trump extremists. Federal prosecutors are investigating.\n\nThere is no excuse for criminal activity, especially from a police officer, Chief Acevedo said. I can't tell you the anger I feel at the thought of a police officer and other police officers thinking they get to go storm the Capitol.\n\nIn Virginia, photos emerged showing Rocky Mount Police Sgt. T.J. Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker inside the Capitol with other rioters. Robertson told The Roanoke Times that he and officer Fracker did nothing illegal. Where I was at there was no violence. There was no fighting with police officers.\n\nFederal prosecutors say otherwise.\n\nEach officer has been charged with one federal count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Both were arrested and released without bond.\n\nIn a since-deleted Facebook post, Fracker wrote after the riots: Lol to anyone who's possibly concerned about the picture of me going around... Sorry I hate freedom? ...Not like I did anything illegal...y'all do what you feel you need to. And in screenshot of a Facebook post circulating, Robertson wrote: CNN and the Left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business ... The right IN ONE DAY took the f——— U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.\n\nAsked for comment, Town Manager James Ervin said in an email to NPR that the town supports their employees' rights to engage in speech and assembly but expects the actions taken while doing so to be lawful. Ervin declined to comment further, citing the criminal probe. The officers are currently on paid leave, Ervin says, as per town policy.\n\nThe federal charges and ongoing investigations are likely to further erode public trust in police and again raise concerns about oversight and accountability, especially in the wake of 2020's nationwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice following the killings of Black men and women by police officers.\n\nChuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told NPR the charges against off-duty officers are all the more reprehensible because many officers on duty at the Capitol acted heroically that day.\n\nPolice officers should know more than others that engaging in mob behavior is abhorrent. At a time when people are questioning police legitimacy, this isn't helpful. It's worse than that, it's despicable. It's despicable because you have 50 officers hurt and one who died. This is just unconscionable, Wexler said, adding, those officers who engaged in mob behavior should be held accountable and should not be police officers. Period.\n\nSue Rahr is the former King County, Wash., sheriff who now runs the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission.\n\nOne of the top philosophical statements we make to recruits is you are guardians of the democracy. You're not just there to investigate crimes, but you're there to actually uphold the democracy, because our country depends on the rule of law, Rahr told NPR. And what happened at the Capitol was completely against everything that the concept of the rule of law stands for.\n\nIn Texas, Bexar County Sheriff's Lt. Roxanne Mathai, an eight-year veteran of the force, is on unpaid administrative leave after posting photos of herself in the pro-Trump mob on a Capitol balcony after rioters stormed past police lines. She called it on Facebook one of the best days of her life. She also faces possible federal charges. A post on her Facebook page also says and we are going in... in the crowd at the stairs...not inside the capitol like the others. Not catching a case lol.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told KSAT TV: My intent is that she never set foot in this building again.\n\nMathai's lawyer, Hector Cortes, told the news station that her role in the chaos is really just attending a political rally for a president who she supports. A department spokesman, Deputy Johnny Garcia, told NPR that Mathai already was on administrative leave from a previous incident involving an inappropriate relationship with an inmate in the jail. Garcia declined to elaborate on either case since both are under investigation.\n\nThe New York Police Department is looking into allegations one of their officers was among the rioters. John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said on Thursday, We're taking outside tips, we're getting information from the FBI, adding that internal affairs is the recipient of any allegations that anybody who is an employee of the NYPD conducted any illegal activity.\n\nSeven off-duty transit police officers in Philadelphia also face scrutiny after they attended the Trump rally preceding the attack on the Capitol, NPR member station WHYY reports.\n\nThey are being investigated to see if they were involved in riotous behavior or for violations of our social media policies, said Chief Thomas Nestel of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.\n\nIn Seattle, two police officers who attended the rally are also under investigation. Interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz in a statement said that while he fully supports all lawful expressions of free speech, if any SPD officers were directly involved in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, I will immediately terminate them. While OPA investigates, these officers have been placed on administrative leave.\n\nIn Chicago, there are calls for the resignation of John Catanzara, who heads the powerful police union. Catanzara at first strongly defended the rioters, called them nonviolent and echoed the president's false claims about election fraud in an interview with NPR station WBEZ. He later apologized.\n\nIn Oklahoma, social media posts raise questions about Canadian County Sheriff Chris West, because of statements attributed to him on a since-deleted Facebook account. West said at a press conference that he only attended the rally and did not push past police or enter the Capitol. Last Friday, West said the egregious crimes on our beacon and bastion of last hope for our nation, breaking into that and terrorizing it, I rebuke all of that, every bit of it.\n\nBut KFOR TV in Oklahoma reports that a man named Bryan Harter claims he was in the Capitol with the sheriff during the insurrection, posting on Facebook, I was in DC for the protest at the capitol with sheriff west. I took a weeks vacation spent my own money and drove 40 hours round trip! After 23 years of military service, I felt it my duty to stand for us. For fair elections. Honestly they are lucky we just occupied. We literally pushed past the police said we are here and left. Burned nothing looted nothing. Now we are called terrorists. People better wake Up, before its too late.\n\nAnd in the deleted Facebook account, KFOR reported, Sheriff West appears to embrace the baseless claims of election fraud pushed by President Trump. If they're okay rigging an election and foreign help to steal the white house and control of WeThePeople, then I'm okay with using whatever means necessary to preserve America and save FREEDOM & LIBERTY.\n\nPolice training executive Rahr says she sent a memo to all her recruits and staff reminding them of the important role law enforcement can play in reassuring the public that our democracy can survive the politically divisive conflicts that are erupting. Rahr adds the majority of law enforcement officers in this country are just as ashamed and disgusted as I am because the storming of the Capitol is, there's there's no defense for that. There just isn't.\n\nNPR's Martin Kaste contributed to this story.
Evaluating Trump's Foreign Policy From A Conservative Perspective\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump is a Republican who hasn't had a particularly conservative foreign policy. He called the Iraq War the single worst decision ever made. He's lauded Russia, praised North Korea and said he'll withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Syria. This week, he came back from Hanoi with no deal with Kim Jong Un. There's the prolonged humanitarian political crisis in Venezuela and shifting - are they staying or going - policies of U.S. troops in Syria and Afghanistan. Is this administration's foreign policy unraveling?\n\nWe're going to take stock with two foreign policy experts who are conservatives. Danielle Pletka is with the American Enterprise Institute. Thanks so much for being with us.\n\nDANIELLE PLETKA: A pleasure.\n\nSIMON: And Christopher Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute in our studios - thank you for being with us.\n\nCHRISTOPHER PREBLE: Thank you for having me.\n\nSIMON: Let's start with North Korea and you first, Danielle Pletka. Does flying halfway around the world to get nothing suggest the administration just isn't doing its homework?\n\nPLETKA: Well, yes, frankly, it does. I mean, I think that a lot of people felt, let's say, tolerably comfortable with the idea that Donald Trump wanted to start things off with a person-to-person meeting with Kim Jong Un. But by the second meeting, it appeared that it was meeting for meeting's sake and that the North Korean leader was taking the president of the United States for a ride.\n\nSIMON: Mr. Preble - Mr. Preble, sorry.\n\nPREBLE: I don't think there's ever an argument against meeting, per se. I take Danielle's point, but there's also - it's also true that we don't have regular dialogue prior to this meeting last year. And so continuing that dialogue at some level seems to me like a good idea. I would hope...\n\nSIMON: Just at some level - what about below that?\n\nPREBLE: Right. Well, that's the point. Right, that's my point. So I do think that thinking that you can start this from the top down, that perhaps may be true, but you also need to have a working-level dialogue. And I would hope that that will continue even though this particular meeting in Hanoi did not produce any breakthrough.\n\nSIMON: But did just having these two summits and President Trump's almost rhapsodic praise boosted Kim Jong Un's prestige?\n\nPREBLE: I don't endorse the praise, but I don't - I also don't believe that meeting with a leader necessarily implies an endorsement of their behavior and their - the treatment of their people. The president, after all, has met with a number of other leaders who have horrendous human rights records, including, for example, our allies, the Saudis. So that by itself does not trouble me.\n\nSIMON: Danielle Pletka, I want to get you to talk about Venezuela, if I could - President Maduro refusing to step down despite international and U.S. pressure. Do you see a discernible U.S. policy there?\n\nPLETKA: Actually, I think Venezuela is a real success story for this administration and in a very conventional way, actually. You know, here we see that the administration actually did some homework. They built the foundations. They worked with our allies. They worked with the multilateral, in this case, the Organization of American States. They really have brought together, you know, a coalition of, at this point, dozens of countries that recognize the now constitutional leader of Venezuela, Mr. Guaido. And they are ratcheting up pressure in ways that are, I think, quite careful.\n\nI recognize that this is going to be a hard slog. Maduro and his backers in Havana are very, very committed to hanging on. They have that exploited the Venezuelan people and the economy much to their personal financial advantage. And they don't want to let that go. But I do think the administration has actually shown a lot of skill in this area. I've been very impressed. And they've been quiet about it as well, which is something that we so rarely see from Donald Trump.\n\nSIMON: I want to get you to talk about that, too, Mr. Preble, but let me insert would it help for the United States to give a pledge of no military intervention to assuage people who are concerned that that's where it's headed?\n\nPREBLE: Well, I think people are concerned about it, and I think they should be concerned about that. The United States has a track record of using military force and violating the sovereignty of a number of countries, not just in this hemisphere but around the world. So I think that it is important to emphasize that there is a constitutional process that Juan Guaido is - has a legitimate claim. And I think it's equally important that the Lima Group, not just the Organization of American States but an organization - a loose coalition of states not led by the United States has endorsed Guaido is significant. But I think the United States could complicate things if it implies, as some have, that ultimately the United States is going to determine this by force.\n\nSIMON: Let me ask you both and begin with you again, Danielle Pletka - has the United States abdicated a leadership role in the world? And has that - does that really assist the world at this moment?\n\nPLETKA: That's a very tough question. You know, I mean, I firmly believe that the world is a better place when the United States leads. You know, the world is not a place where when we step back that nobody else steps in. There are plenty of eager players on the global stage, whether it's the Chinese with the rules that they like to promulgate or the Russians or even regionally whether it's the Iranians or others. You really do see that there are actual challenges to our global leadership.\n\nThe question of whether we've abdicated, though, is a - much more than a Trump question because this really began in the Obama administration. President Obama was much less committed to the American global role. And, you know, let's set aside these questions of exceptionalism that's obsessed, you know, the front pages but just less committed to an American leadership profile abroad...\n\nSIMON: Leading from behind was the phrase I remember from Libya, yeah.\n\nPLETKA: Yes, a most regrettable phrase for a most regrettable - a badly managed, badly led and badly concluded operation in Libya. So, you know, this has been a trend. And the one thing I think is absolutely clear, and I expect that Chris will disagree with me about this, but the one thing I think is clear is that without presidential leadership, the American people don't actually understand or want to sign up to anything that we do overseas except perhaps global trade. And even there now, we see a question.\n\nSIMON: Christopher Preble.\n\nPREBLE: Well, actually, Danielle and I agree on the importance of trade, and I think the president has taken a bad step in the wrong direction on that. But in terms of U.S. leadership, we have to remember where this all started. After World War II, the entire world was shattered, and the few countries that were capable of doing anything about it, one of them was the Soviet Union. And so in that context, I was pretty happy to see the United States take a leading role. But it's striking to me that Danielle mentions Russia and China and even Iran regionally but not any of the other countries in the world - of which there are roughly 190 other countries in the world - which might actually take a more leading role, at least in their own region. And, again, that's why I point back to what's happened in Venezuela and the response of other countries in the region. I just...\n\nSIMON: Are you speaking of, let's say, for example, India and Southeast Asia?\n\nPREBLE: Right, sure, of course, India or in Europe, there are still a number of important, powerful players. You look at the way that the other parties to the Iran nuclear deal are continuing to abide by that deal and try to move it forward. These are countries that have identified what their interests are, and they do not necessarily align with the United States.\n\nSIMON: Christopher Preble is vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. You have a book out next month - Peace, War, And Liberty: Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute; thank you both very much for being with us.\n\nPREBLE: Thank you.\n\nPLETKA: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Feds To Waive Penalties For Some Who Signed Up Late For Medicare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images/iStockphoto Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nEach year, thousands of Americans miss their deadline to enroll in Medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. That failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.\n\nNow Medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from those late-enrollment penalties for anyone who kept the ACA policy after becoming eligible for Medicare Part B. For those 65 and older and for people with disabilities, Medicare Part B covers doctor visits and outpatient care.\n\nMany of these people who missed the deadline did not receive the information necessary ... through the marketplace to make an informed decision regarding Medicare enrollment, says a Medicare spokesman, explaining the policy change.\n\nAutumn deadline to request a waiver of the late-enrollment penalty\n\nPeople age 65 and older who have a marketplace plan or had one they lost or canceled, as well as people who qualify for Medicare because of a disability, but chose to stay with a marketplace plan, may qualify for the penalty waiver or a reduction. They'll now have until Sept. 30 to request the waiver, according to federal health officials.\n\nThis has been a problem from the beginning of the Affordable Care Act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for Medicare, says Bonnie Burns, a consultant for the consumer group California Health Advocates. Once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for Medicare, nobody told them to make that change.\n\nLisa Grimes' 49-year-old sister is one of those people. She receives Social Security disability benefits because of mental illness. She became eligible for Medicare automatically because of the disability benefits, but she had marketplace coverage at that time. (Grimes agreed to be interviewed as long as her sister was not identified.)\n\nGrimes' sister mistakenly opted to keep her marketplace plan and drop her Part B coverage, probably because her marketplace premium at the time cost half as much, says Grimes. That decision has kept Grimes, a St. Louis real estate lawyer, busy for months, unraveling the consequences.\n\nOnly after the sister's $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did she and Grimes learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join Medicare.\n\nThe rules are tricky, and mistakes are common\n\n\n\nOther Medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn't need Part B if they had a marketplace plan, or retiree coverage from a former employer, or health coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or via a current employer with fewer than 20 workers. Beneficiaries didn't realize that none of these is a substitute for Medicare Part B.\n\nGrimes says her sister couldn't afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. After that, the Social Security Administration denied her appeal to reinstate her Part B coverage with no penalty or wait period. Then she learned about the new Medicare waiver — from a Missouri counselor at the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\n\nIt took several hours for Grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. But with assistance from the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received Part B coverage without a late fee or waiting period. It was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.\n\nUsually people need to sign up for Part B within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to Medicare rules. Most people under 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits qualify for Part B after 24 months of benefits.\n\nUnder the ACA, people who qualify for Medicare will lose subsidies if they choose to remain in plans purchased on the federal or state exchanges. And being enrolled in one of those plans does not protect them from a permanent late enrollment penalty from Medicare.\n\nMarketplace insurers, who are often the first to spot when a member is turning 65, are barred under the health law from canceling coverage because that member may qualify for Medicare, Burns says.\n\nLast summer, Medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. The notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in Marketplace and Medicare coverage. Officials also began contacting individuals who already have both Medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.\n\nHow to get a waiver of the penalty\n\nYet many people have missed the warnings.\n\nThese are very complex rules, says Stacy Sanders, federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, which spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors' advocacy organizations to convince Medicare officials to address the problem.\n\nThe lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying Part B, Sanders says.\n\nIn March, Medicare began emailing letters about the temporary waiver to some people 65 and older who are enrolled in plans sold on the marketplaces run by the federal government. But others who may be eligible for a waiver are not getting those notices.\n\nCalifornia, which has the largest state-run marketplace, serving 1.4 million consumers, is planning a similar information campaign. So are some other states that run their own marketplaces, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.\n\nPeople who may be eligible for the waiver, officially called time-limited equitable relief, must submit a request by Sept. 30. You can find information on how to apply on the Medicare Rights Center's Medicare Interactive website or can call the center's helpline at 800-333-4114.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Remembering Adrian Cronauer, The DJ Who Inspired 'Good Morning Vietnam'\n\nCronauer, who died last week, hosted an armed forces radio show in Saigon during the Vietnam War and later was the subject of a film starring comic Robin Williams. Originally broadcast in 1988.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM)\n\nROBIN WILLIAMS: (As Adrian Cronauer) Good morning, Vietnam. Hey, this is not a test. This is rock 'n' roll. Time to rock it from the delta to the DMZ. Is that me, or does that sound like an Elvis Presley movie? Viva Da Nang. (Singing) Oh, Viva Da Nang.\n\nGROSS: That's Robin Williams in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam playing a fictionalized version of Adrian Cronauer. Cronauer died last Wednesday at the age of 79. In 1965, during the war in Vietnam, he was a DJ in Saigon on Armed Forces Radio hosting a Top 40 radio show called Dawn Buster in which he signed on each morning with the now-famous words, good morning, Vietnam. After returning to the States, he continued working in broadcasting. But with the money he earned from the movie, he went to law school.\n\nI spoke with him in early 1988 when he was a second-year law student at the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to become active in veterans' causes and served as an adviser to the State Department's Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Office. I asked him what the Armed Forces Radio station in Saigon sounded like when he got there.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nADRIAN CRONAUER: If you've seen the film, you'll notice at the very beginning there was a very dull, dry, boring, soporific announcement about how to get your hold baggage if you'd lost your duffel bag or your trunk out of Tan Son Nhut Air Base. That is as accurate depiction as is humanly possible of what the station sounded like when I got there. And one of my aims was just to make it sound more like a stateside station.\n\nGROSS: How did you sign on the first morning that you did your show?\n\nCRONAUER: The same as I did every other one. We would have a little bit of music from an album called Like Tweet by Joe Puma and the Audiobon All-Stars.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCRONAUER: And then I would say, good morning, Vietnam, and then start into the program that way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: Did you get an immediate reaction from the soldiers who were listening to your show?\n\nCRONAUER: No. The reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. We did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. First of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. But secondly, there was a reaction that I would get mostly when I went out into the field. We would get an occasional card and letter. But if I'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? And I'd say Cronauer. And they'd say, oh, yeah, I think I - and I'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. And I found out later on that many times the GIs, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if I'd do the good morning, Vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the GI equivalent of get stuffed, Cronauer.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) What did you play the most when you were on the air?\n\nCRONAUER: Whatever happened to be currently popular, again, looking at what were the popular songs in the States and assuming that the GIs who came over from the States would want to hear what's popular back at home. Our whole idea was whether it was in the music policy or the production that we did on the air, it was to make it sound as much as possible like a stateside radio station to give them a little link with home as a morale factor.\n\nGROSS: In the movie, the Robin Williams version of Adrian Cronauer is censored when he wants to read the real news that comes across the wire. All the news that comes over the wire is first presented to censors. And in the movie, the character witnesses a bombing at a restaurant that a lot of the Army men hang out in, and he's not allowed to mention that on the air. Similar things happened to you?\n\nCRONAUER: On the subject of censorship, the movie is very accurate, except in one small detail. We did not have censors on premises at the stations. It was done by phone. But there was indeed a restaurant called the My Canh floating restaurant. It was built on a boat that was moored in the Saigon River.\n\nAnd one evening, I had dinner there with some friends from the station. And after dinner, we were still hanging out in the area when the Viet Cong sprayed the boat with shrapnel from a Claymore mine. And then, about three or four minutes later, when everyone was panicking and trying to get off the boat, they aimed another Claymore mine directly at the gangplank and did a lot of carnage. And I heard the report of the explosion and the commotion and went back to see what was going on, tried to help out a bit and then went back to the station to see if I could put the item on the air.\n\nAnd I called the duty officer for permission to put the story on the air and was denied permission. And I asked for a reason. And he said, we have no official confirmation of this happening yet. And I explained that I had been there in person, had seen it with my own eyes. And the answer was still, no, we have no real confirmation of any casualties. And I said, sir, with my own eyes, I've seen heads severed from torsos. Barring the second coming, they will not get up and walk away. And the final answer was no. And the final reason was, well, suppose we're wrong.\n\nGROSS: So you didn't defy the order and then go on the air, right (laughter)?\n\nCRONAUER: No, I did not go and lock myself in the studio and put it on anyway. No. In fact, there are a lot of things in that movie that Robin does - if I had actually done them, I would have been court martialed, and I'd still be in Leavenworth.\n\nGROSS: When you were on the air, were there any signs in the control room that there was actually a war going on?\n\nCRONAUER: It was basically a traditional, ordinary, run-of-the-mill radio station control room. The only real reminder of the war was the fact that on the console beside the turntables was a loaded .45. Over in the newsroom, there was another one beside the teletype machines. And we were instructed that if it was necessary, we were expected to use it.\n\nGROSS: You were in Vietnam in 1965. And that was a year that the war really escalated. What were some of the things that you saw that made you realize that the war was really changing?\n\nCRONAUER: When I got to Saigon in May of '65, it was a sleepy, little French colonial town. And in one year's time, I saw it turn into a nightmare. The massive influx of American personnel, equipment, armament, money turned the city upside down. There were the - when I left, the black market was flourishing. The economy was in disarray. The traffic was unmanageable. The entire city was ridiculous. And although I found it a very enjoyable place to be when I first got there, in the context of a - that it was a war going on, it was - I was very glad to get out.\n\nGROSS: What was your reaction the first time you saw the completed movie?\n\nCRONAUER: For about five minutes or so, it was difficult to get used to the idea that, well, that's Adrian Cronauer up there, but I'm Adrian Cronauer. But he's me, but I'm here. And then finally, I just settled down and said, all right, relax. Enjoy the movie.\n\nGROSS: Well, Adrian Cronauer, I want to thank you very much for talking with me.\n\nCRONAUER: My pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Adrian Cronauer, recorded in 1988 after the release of the film Good Morning, Vietnam, in which Robin Williams played a fictionalized version of Cronauer. Cronauer died Wednesday. He was 79.\n\nTomorrow on FRESH AIR, can we eat meat ethically? We'll get a resounding yes from my guest, Camas Davis. After working for years as a restaurant reviewer and an editor, she apprenticed as a butcher on a family-run small farm and slaughterhouse in France. Then she founded a program to teach people about conscientious slaughtering and to inspire responsible meat production and consumption. She has a new memoir.

After Holland approves a case, it then goes to the desk of Maj. Gen. Kelly McKeague, JPAC's military commander. He has never denied a request, but he says the extreme scrutiny is more than justified. The work JPAC does, McKeague says, matters more than work the FBI might do in a death penalty case.\n\nThere's much more at stake, he says. It defines us as a nation.\n\nMcKeague then cites a quote attributed to Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States: The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself forgotten.\n\nThird, the process is mired in bureaucracy. The disinterments JPAC does approve must go through additional government layers to the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the Army for final approval. While these steps tend to be a rubber stamp — the Army has never turned JPAC down — DNA can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.\n\nHolland acknowledges that the best way to honor those individuals would be to identify them, and that the quickest way to do that would be to exhume them and use DNA. Still, he's conservative; he says he's handcuffed by Pentagon policy and hesitant to lose any more autonomy by pushing for more disinterments.\n\nAnd there's an additional complication: Disinterred remains that JPAC can't identify end up sitting in boxes on shelves in a closet. Most people agree that's not the way to honor soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice, and JPAC told NPR and ProPublica that the standard for disinterring U.S. service members is very high. They don't want to dig up remains unless they are pretty confident they can identify them.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the 45,000 MIAs and POWs the Pentagon believes are recoverable are interred as unknowns in American military cemeteries around the world.\n\nOne of them is Bud Kelder. He is buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, and his family still wants him to come home.\n\nBud lived through hell, says his cousin, Ron Kelder. Of his 26 years of life, the last seven months was sheer hell. That's not where Bud would want to be. Our government has a policy of returning everybody, leave nobody behind. I think they should honor it.
Flint Pediatrician Says Charges Against Ex-Governor Help 'Wounds Finally Close'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nThe Flint, Mich., water crisis resulted in charges Wednesday against former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who is now facing two counts of willful neglect of duty.\n\nThe misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. They come almost seven years after the city of Flint began taking in water from the Flint River in an attempt to save money. The water wasn't properly treated, and it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. More than 100,000 Flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead.\n\nDuring an arraignment Thursday, Snyder pleaded not guilty to the charges. Several additional officials are also facing charges over their alleged roles in the crisis, including the state's former health director and Flint's former director of public works.\n\nThe charges drew mixed reactions from people who have been working to help the city deal with the crisis and its aftermath.\n\nAccountability is great, but even with accountability, even if Rick Snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with residents, said LaTricea Adams, who heads Black Millennials For Flint, which advocates for the rights of Flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.\n\nMona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who was among the first to raise a red flag over the contamination, said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition that having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nYears ago, Hanna-Attisha began noticing that her young patients in Flint were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood following the change in the water supply. She called a press conference in September 2015 and warned residents, especially children, to stop drinking the water.\n\nMore than five years later, Hanna-Attisha is now the director of Flint's pediatric public health initiative. She is also the author of What the Eyes Don't See, a book about her experiences in the crisis.\n\nBelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nCan I ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong. What was going through your mind?\n\nIt was the summer of 2015. I was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. And she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that Mona, the water isn't being treated properly in Flint. And because of that, there's probably lead in the water. And that's the moment that my life changed. When I heard the word lead, it was a call to action. I respect the science of what lead does. I understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. And I also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. It's the last thing our kids in Flint needed. That's the moment I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating, I lost about 30 pounds. And I began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.\n\nWhat do you make of these charges now?\n\nIt's a bit of disbelief. It's been so long. And for so many people in Flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied — that there was never going to be this level of accountability. And as a physician in Flint, I never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. There [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. And as I began to practice more in Flint and interact with the families in Flint, I began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. Because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. And it's been open for about seven years. And having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nYou've written a book, and in it you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. Can you explain how you see that?\n\nSo many people ask me, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? And there's not one villain. There's not 10 villains. There [are] many villains. And this is what I say in my book:\n\nThere are lots of villains in this story. A disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. Many people stopped caring about Flint and Flint's kids. Many people looked the other way. People in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. While charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. Because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. The real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.\n\nAnd these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison Flint with policy. And I hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.\n\nWhat could that possibly look like now? Even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?\n\nThat has been my work since Day 1. From the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. You can think of what happened in Flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. And we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. So what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support Flint families — like child care, like Medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. Because what Flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. And people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.\n\nWould the crisis have happened had Flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?\n\nOf course not. Flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. It never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. There's a long history of racism in Flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.\n\nAs the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is.\n\nMy focus is to make sure that the kids of Flint have the brightest future possible, that we can not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.\n\nCatherine Whelan produced the audio version of this story.

Remembering A Congressman Who Bucked His Party On An Impeachment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nWhen I met Tom Railsback a few years ago, he told me he'd worried about going to a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Peoria in the fall of 1974.\n\nTom Railsback of Illinois was a middle-aged Republican congressman from a state in the middle of America when he was on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 that heard the case for impeachment against President Richard Nixon.\n\nMr. Railsback greatly admired President Nixon. His opening of the door to China, he told me, had to be the most brilliant foreign policy move ever.\n\nBut, when President Nixon refused to turn over records and recordings requested by Congress, Tom Railsback took to the floor to say, If the Congress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to exonerate, we'll be regarded as a paper tiger.\n\nTom Railsback worked with Democrats to draft an article of impeachment that charged President Nixon with abuse of his authority to obstruct the Watergate investigation. It was this article that won support from six Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. And when Richard Nixon realized he could not take Republican support for granted, he resigned in August of 1974.\n\nTom Railsback, as of this moment, is a dead duck, declared the Journal Star of Peoria, a city near his district.\n\nHow will this play in Peoria? was an old vaudeville phrase that people in the Nixon administration also used to ask if a policy would be popular in what they took to be the heart of America.\n\nSo, when the congressman was invited for lunch at the Peoria Chamber of Commerce just a few weeks later, he knew friends and neighbors who had supported him would be there, and be upset.\n\nBut I figured, he told me, you have to look the people you represent in the eye. Give them a chance to tell you you're wrong.\n\nTom Railsback remembered that when he walked into the Peoria dining room, it fell silent. Then he heard one person start to applaud; then a few more; and soon people all over the room stood up to applaud.\n\nPeople came up to shake my hand, he said, and tell me, 'Tom, I disagree with that vote. But you did what you thought was right, and I'm glad you represent me.' \n\nTom Railsback died this week at the age of 87. He was reelected to Congress after his impeachment vote, time after time after time.
In Japan, Pence Talks Trade And North Korea's Threat To The Region\n\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda is focused. The other major issue is trade. Pence met with Japan's prime minister.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling the Pacific Rim, where so much of President Trump's foreign policy agenda has been focused, especially with these tensions with North Korea. In Tokyo this morning, the vice president repeated what he had said the day before in South Korea.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The United States will continue to work with Japan and with all our allies in the region, including South Korea, to confront the most ominous threat posing this region of the world - the regime in North Korea.\n\nGREENE: Of course, North Korea is not the only subject on the vice president's mind. And NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following the trip and joins us from Tokyo. Anthony, good morning.\n\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\n\nGREENE: So trade is the other big issue here on this visit. The Trump administration, as we know, has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that was so prominent on the campaign trail. And they keep talking about, quote, bilateral agreements. What is the point of stressing that word?\n\nKUHN: The idea, David, is that the U.S. wants to renegotiate trade deals not with the whole region of Asia but with individual trading partners and that includes Japan. And Pence emphasized that they want a more level playing field, better terms of trade that gives American companies better access to the Japanese market, allows them to sell more products and create more jobs in the U.S.\n\nGREENE: So is Japan open to this? Is there a way that they can get something out of a new deal with the United States?\n\nKUHN: Well, you know, Japan feels that they worked so hard for so many years on the TPP. And they got a - what they thought was a pretty good deal. So basically they would like not to kill it off. They would like to keep the TPP alive with the other 11 countries, keep it in some form and then do a separate, perhaps, bilateral deal with the U.S. later.\n\nBut they are wary of any new deal that would challenge their protection of certain sectors, most importantly agriculture. Rice, as you can imagine, is a very politically symbolic industry in Japan.\n\nGREENE: So interesting too because Shinzo Abe, the Japanese leader, the first leader to meet with Donald Trump, gave him a golden golf club, I mean, has really been trying to develop this relationship and probably hoping that he has some sort of leverage.\n\nKUHN: That's right. But, you know, the relationship has changed a lot since President Trump or Trump back in the 1980s started railing against the imbalances in trade. You know, the Japanese economy has stagnated for more than two decades. And it's been eclipsed by China as the second largest economy.\n\nAnd Japan is just not seen as the economic threat and competitor that it was. And at the same time, you know, the importance of Japanese-invested factories that create jobs in places like Indiana, where Mike Pence was governor before, have become very important.\n\nNow, there are also new things. Japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when President Trump would like to build more infrastructure in the U.S. And also remember that in 2011 following the Fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, Japan shut down its nuclear plants. So now Japan is a very good market for U.S. exports of oil and natural gas.\n\nGREENE: So it almost sounds like Donald Trump had this line from the 1980s and maybe he's using the same line for a country that really has changed a lot?\n\nKUHN: Yes, that's true in China as well. He blamed both countries for devaluing their currency when it hasn't been the case for quite awhile. Trump is still very concerned about keeping the yen on, you know, the yen weak to the dollar - I mean, excuse me, strong to the dollar so that Japanese exports don't flood the U.S. market.\n\nGREENE: OK. NPR's Anthony Kuhn covering the vice president's trip to Japan, speaking to us from Tokyo. Anthony, thanks a lot.\n\nKUHN: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Appears To Back Off 2-State Solution In Meeting With Netanyahu\n\nMeeting Israel's prime minister, President Trump said he does not think a Palestinian state next to Israel is necessarily the way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, representing a shift in U.S. policy.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nNow let's look at what Donald Trump had to say about Israel as he stood alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.\n\nMICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: For decades, the U.S. approach to the Middle East peace process was based on the idea of two states for two peoples, the Palestinians and the Israelis. But Donald Trump is shaking this up.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.\n\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Laughter).\n\nTRUMP: I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one.\n\nKELEMEN: That's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chuckling in the background. When an Israeli journalist pressed him on this, Netanyahu said he didn't want to get bogged down in labels. The Israeli prime minister says he's looking for new ways to reach peace with the Palestinians.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nNETANYAHU: And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach, from involving our newfound Arab partners.\n\nKELEMEN: It's been dubbed the outside-in approach, and the idea is that Arab states will encourage the Palestinians to make peace with Israel, and Israel will get broad recognition in the Muslim world. David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy says Arab states may be working more closely now with Israel on security issues but don't want to stick out their neck for Netanyahu.\n\nDAVID MAKOVSKY: Right now, the Arab states have an under-the-table relationship with the Israelis, and whatever they get from Israel under the table they get for free, so to speak. So I don't know if they have an incentive to go above the table, and I don't know if that's going to bring the Palestinians in or not.\n\nKELEMEN: Makovsky doesn't believe the Trump administration is really backing away from the idea of a two-state solution. He says Trump's remarks were mainly for political tactical reasons to help out Netanyahu, whose critics at home made this a key issue.\n\nMAKOVSKY: In many ways, the question of whether we're going to hit a two-state solution is like saying, how are we going to get the runner home from third base when we don't even have a runner on first base yet?\n\nKELEMEN: Palestinians, though, are calling on Trump and Netanyahu to be clear about the alternatives - either a non-democratic Israel that treats Palestinians as second-class citizens or a country that no longer has a Jewish majority. We reached Hanan Ashrawi of the PLO's executive committee in Ramallah.\n\nHANAN ASHRAWI: If they want one state, let's deal with citizenship and equal rights. And we'll all become citizens of that one state, and we will act democratically.\n\nKELEMEN: Ashrawi says President Trump is going against the global consensus on the Middle East and listening so far mainly to right-wing leaders in Israel and to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose family has supported Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank.\n\nASHRAWI: They know that they cannot make any moves, or they cannot launch any kind of peace initiative if they want one without addressing the Palestinian question and talking to the Palestinian political leadership. And I think they will sooner or later. Right now, I think they're feeling their way. They're not sure. I'd much rather they study the file, they study the case before they jump to conclusions.\n\nKELEMEN: There are some signs that Trump may already be moderating his positions. He says he's still studying whether to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. Arab leaders have been privately urging him not to do that, and they've raised concerns about the Israeli government's plans to expand settlements in the West Bank. Trump had a message for Netanyahu on that today, too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made.\n\nKELEMEN: Netanyahu seemed to be taken aback and was making no promises to rein in building projects. He argued that this is not the core of the problem. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

China Cuts Tariffs On Autos, Possibly Easing Trade Tensions With U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption -/AFP/Getty Images -/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:18 p.m. ET\n\nChina is cutting tariffs on vehicles from the U.S., but the biggest benefits could go to German automakers — and Tesla, the American electric-car maker.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping signaled in a speech last month that the tariff cut would be coming. The foreign ministry confirmed it Tuesday: Tariffs will drop from 25 percent to 15 percent for imported cars. Tariffs on imported auto parts will fall to six percent.\n\nU.S. manufacturers and policymakers have been arguing for years that China should lower its tariffs. President Trump railed against the imbalance in trade tariffs in April, tweeting that they amount to STUPID TRADE. The U.S. imposes a tariff of just 2.5 percent on vehicles imported from China.\n\nThe tariff reduction is seen as an olive branch to the Trump administration. It comes as the two countries work to avoid a trade war after the tough-talk and tariff escalations last month.\n\nChina is a huge market for the U.S. auto industry. America shipped almost $10 billion worth of vehicles to China in 2017, according to the Commerce Department, plus another $3.5 billion in vehicle parts.\n\nBut much of that trade originates from companies whose headquarters are outside the U.S. BMW and Mercedes-Benz, for example, build cars in the U.S. to be shipped to China. BMW sold nearly 107,000 U.S.-made vehicles to China last year, while Mercedes-Benz sold more than 72,000, according to LMC Automotive.\n\nBusiness U.S. Puts Trade War On Hold While Talking With China, Mnuchin Says U.S. Puts Trade War On Hold While Talking With China, Mnuchin Says Listen · 4:34 4:34\n\nThe two biggest U.S. car companies, General Motors and Ford, don't rely as much on exporting to China. Instead, they build the majority of cars they sell in China in that country. The Chinese market is important for both of them — GM sells more cars in China than it does in the U.S. But because most of those cars are built and sold in China, the sales are not subject to the tariffs.\n\nThere is at least one U.S.-based car manufacturer that could win big from the reduction in Chinese tariffs. Tesla has been looking to break into the Chinese market, but the 25 percent tariff has put its already-expensive electric vehicles out of reach for most Chinese consumers. Tesla sold nearly 15,000 cars in China last year, according to LMC.\n\nChina says the new tariff policy will take effect in July.
Libertarian Candidates Pitch Themselves As Antidote To Partisanship\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\n\nLibertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees.\n\nBoth are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues.\n\nWe want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think that, said Weld, the party's vice presidential nominee.\n\nJohnson, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 before becoming the Libertarian nominee four years ago, said if they are elected, the two longtime lawmakers will almost act as co-presidents — sharing a staff and planning to do this as a partnership.\n\nTwo heads for the price of one, and that it would be a plus for the country, believing that, the former New Mexico governor said.\n\nI think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House, and we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party, the smartest people from the Republican Party and the best people from the Libertarian Party, Weld added.\n\nThe two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.\n\nA third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void.\n\nThe idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington, Weld said. That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.\n\nJohnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was beholden to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that smacks of pay-to-play.\n\nBut Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq.\n\nHe's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man, Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.\n\nJohnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though.\n\nA wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil, he told a questioner.\n\nJohnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that religious freedom, as a category was a black hole, and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding.\n\nI fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against, Johnson said. There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.\n\nShetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.\n\nMy head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up, Johnson said. This discrimination does exist.\n\nOn the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.\n\nWe both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists, Johnson said. We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists. We don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe.
New York, Illinois Governors Issue Stay At Home Orders, Following California's Lead\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 5:48 p.m. ET\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday afternoon issued an order for all Illinois residents to stay at home, as the deadly coronavirus has spread to a quarter of the state's counties and infected more than 500 people.\n\nThe stricter limits go into effect on Saturday.\n\nThey follow a similar order by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who issued a mandate earlier on Friday, and another by California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday. The governors of Connecticut, Nevada and New Jersey also say they want people to stay at home.\n\nWe know this will be hard, Pritzker said in a news conference, adding that the new rules are expected to last until April 7.\n\nThat gives us time to see whether or not this social distancing ... is having the desired effect of slowing the spread of COVID-19, he said.\n\nPritzker said essential services including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open, and restaurants will be allowed to continue take-out services. But most other places will have to shut down.\n\nHowever, he pleaded with people not to rush out to a grocery store or gas station to stockpile essential goods.\n\nHealth care professionals and other essential workers will be provided with safe child care, according to Pritzker, who offered no details on how such programs will work. Students will also continue receiving free meals, he said.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took what what he calls the ultimate step in his state to protect the public, signing an executive order mandating that 100% of workforce must stay home, excluding essential services.\n\nThe order, which Cuomo announced Friday, excludes businesses such as pharmacies and grocery stores, along with essential services such as utilities and Internet providers.\n\nWhen I talk about the most drastic action we can take — this is the most drastic action we can take, Cuomo said.\n\nIn addition to the workforce order, all nonessential gatherings of individuals in New York state are now canceled — of ANY size for ANY reason, Cuomo said via Twitter. The ban applies to any party, celebration or social event.\n\nYouTube\n\nNew York has confirmed more than 7,100 cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, making it by far the largest single source of the nearly 15,500 cases now reported in the U.S. As of Friday, 38 people in the state had died from the respiratory disease. Nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for killing at least 205 people.\n\nNew York has tested more than 32,000 people for the virus, including 10,000 in one day, Cuomo said. And he said the high number of new cases — New York added some 2,900 coronavirus cases from Thursday to Friday — should not in itself worry people.\n\nIt was the reality, he said. The tests are just demonstrating what was.\n\nBut in a separate part of his news conference, the governor also said his state must add more hospital beds and ventilators to accommodate the influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe rate of increase in the number of cases portends a total overwhelming of our hospital system, Cuomo said.\n\nNew York is working to boost its number of hospital beds, which currently stands at around 50,000. The governor's office says around 18% of the state's coronavirus cases, or 1,255 people, are currently hospitalized.\n\nI believe these policies will save lives. And I'm not willing to put a price on a human life, Cuomo said at a news conference late Friday morning.\n\nStaying at home doesn't mean not being permitted to exercise outdoors.\n\nIt's running. It's hiking, Cuomo said of the preferred activities. It's not playing basketball with five other people. That's not what it is. It's not laying in a park with 10 other people and sharing a beer. That's not what this is.\n\nThe New York order is similar to escalating steps taken in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home indefinitely to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nAs of noon ET Friday, Washington state had reported 1,376 coronavirus cases, and California had reported 1,030, according to a COVID-19 dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, which reports coronavirus numbers in near real time.\n\nCoronavirus: Know The Basics (And Wash Your Hands)\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people also experience fatigue, headaches and, less frequently, diarrhea. Cases can range from mild to moderate to severe. About 80 percent of cases so far seem to be mild, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nTo prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer if a sink isn't available. The WHO says people should wear face masks only if they're sick or caring for someone who is.\n\nWhat should I do if I think I'm sick?\n\nIf you think you've been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Many state and local health departments have set up hotlines to answer questions, so that's another good place to start. It's important that you don't expose others. Call your doctor before you go to their clinic so they can take necessary precautions.\n\nHow do I protect my home?\n\nWash your hands as soon as you walk through the door. Avoid sharing personal items such dishes, cups, utensils. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces like door handles and cellphones every day.\n\nHow do I self-quarantine? And what does it mean?\n\nThe CDC has a guide for caring for yourself at home if you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
Trump Officials Approve Tennessee's Controversial Request To Revamp Medicaid Funding\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nWith less than a dozen days left in power, the Trump administration on Friday approved a radically different Medicaid financing system in Tennessee. With this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from Washington, allowing Tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend Medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.\n\nInstead of the open-ended federal contribution to the funding of Medicaid in all other states — which increases with higher enrollment and associated health costs — Tennessee will instead get a capped amount of money, via an annual block grant.\n\nThe annual funding cap will increase if enrollment grows. What's different is that, unlike with other states, Medicaid funding to Tennessee won't automatically keep up with rising expenses.\n\nThe approval is a 10-year experiment, according to Friday's announcement by Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. They think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.\n\nBut Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center sees the move as a step backward for the state's Medicaid program.\n\nNo other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, Johnson says. It gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.\n\nTennessee is one of 12 states that have not approved expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act – a decision that's left tens of thousands of working adults in Tennessee without health insurance.\n\nWhether this change in the way Tennessee's Medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. The incoming Biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.\n\nImplementing such a fundamental change via an executive branch action rather than getting Congress to amend Medicaid law is also likely to be met with court challenges.\n\nIn any event, the changes to the state's program will take months to implement because the shift in policy requires final approval by the legislature, and officials in Tennessee must also negotiate quality of care targets with the administration.\n\nTennCare, the state's Medicaid program, says the new system would give it unprecedented flexibility to decide who is covered and what services it will pay for.\n\nUnder the agreement, TennCare will have a specified annual spending cap, to be based on historical spending, inflation and predicted future enrollment changes. If the state can operate the program at a lower cost than the cap and maintain or improve quality, the state then shares in the savings.\n\nTrump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. If Medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. If enrollment drops, it will get less money.\n\nThis groundbreaking waiver puts guardrails in place to ensure appropriate oversight and protections for beneficiaries, while also creating incentives for states to manage costs — while holding them accountable for improving access, quality and health outcomes, Verma said. It's no exaggeration to say that this carefully crafted demonstration could be a national model moving forward.\n\nThe agreement is somewhat different from traditional block grants championed by conservatives, the CMS notes, since it allows Tennessee to get more federal funding as enrollment grows. And while the state is given flexibility to increase benefits, it can't on its own cut benefits.\n\nHowever, opponents — including most advocates for low-income Americans — say the approach will threaten care for the 1.4 million people in TennCare — a group that includes children, pregnant women and the disabled. Federal funding covers two-thirds of the cost of the program.\n\nDemocrats have fought back against block grant Medicaid proposals since the Reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of Republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act. Even some key Republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.\n\nThe approval of Tennessee's request comes as Medicaid enrollment is at its highest-ever level.\n\nMore than 76 million Americans are covered by the state-federal health program — a million more than when the Trump administration took charge in 2017. Enrollment has jumped by more than 5 million in the past year as the economy slumped with the pandemic.\n\nMedicaid, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. As a result, the more money states spend on Medicaid, the more they get from Washington.\n\nThe newly approved demonstration project in Tennessee calls for CMS to work with the state to set spending targets that will increase at a fixed amount each year.\n\nThe plan also includes a safety valve to increase federal funding in the case of unexpected increases in enrollment.\n\nThe safety valve will maintain Tennessee's commitment to enroll all eligible Tennesseans with no reduction in today's benefits for beneficiaries, according to a CMS written statement.\n\nTennessee has committed to maintaining coverage for eligible beneficiaries and existing services while staying under the spending targets.\n\nIn exchange for taking on this financing approach, the state will receive a range of operating flexibilities from the federal government, as well as up to 55% of the savings generated on an annual basis when spending falls below the aggregate spending cap and the state meets certain quality targets, yet to be determined.\n\nThe state can spend that money on various health programs for residents, plus areas that Medicaid funding typically doesn't cover, such as improving transportation and education and employment for enrollees.\n\nTen years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the Trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.\n\nThe block grant is just another example of putting politics ahead of health care during this pandemic, says Johnson of the Tennessee Justice Center. Now is absolutely not the time to waste our energy and resources limiting who can access health care.\n\nState officials in Tennessee applauded the approval.\n\nIt's a legacy accomplishment, says Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. This new flexibility means we can work toward improving maternal health coverage and clearing the waiting list for developmentally disabled.\n\nThis means we will be able to make additional investments in TennCare without reduction in services and provider cuts.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

Why This Progressive Says She's Backing Biden In New Hampshire\n\nState Senator Marsha Fuller Clark tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro that she's focused on a candidate who can win over the general electorate and beat President Trump in November.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nDemocrats have just begun to cast their votes for who they think can take on President Trump in November. Coming up is New Hampshire, then on across the country. But where there was once a feeling of celebration at the wealth of nominees, there is now anxiety among some. No clear front-runner has emerged, even as the nominees have been winnowed down.\n\nJoining me now is Martha Fuller Clark. She's a state senator from Portsmouth, N.H. And she's just announced a surprising endorsement which may illuminate some of the tough calculations Democrats are making.\n\nWelcome to the program.\n\nMARTHA FULLER CLARK: Why, thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: In 2016, you endorsed Bernie Sanders. He represents the progressive wing of the party. But now you are backing Joe Biden, who certainly does not. Why?\n\nFULLER CLARK: It's a very different election in 2020. And I think the one significant question that we as Democrats have to ask over and over again - which Democrat is best placed to beat Donald Trump? That's why I am supporting Biden.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Why did you turn away from Sanders this time?\n\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think that Bernie deserves a lot of credit for having changed the conversation in terms of policy within the Democratic Party. That was very strong in 2016. But what he's promising - is it really realistic to be able to achieve those goals under his administration and his leadership? I don't think that that's viable in this country at this time from what I see and what I understand.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. If you're going to pick a moderate, though, why not an Amy Klobuchar or a Pete Buttigieg?\n\nFULLER CLARK: I think they don't have the same level of experience as Joe Biden, and they certainly don't have the credentials with regard to foreign affairs and international policies, which are so key and at great risk with our current president. So I also think that Joe Biden is very well-liked. He's very compassionate. He has great integrity. He's trusted by voters from all different political directions. That's really important if we're going to be able to win in November.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I think what I'm hearing you say is that for you - and I will say for probably many other Democrats - your personal policy preferences are sort of being left to the side. And what is more important is what the general electorate might go for - this idea of electability - not what you might want, but maybe what the country might go for.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Right. And I think the country is looking for a president who is going to be able to bring us all together, regardless of our backgrounds.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But polls show that for Democrats in New Hampshire, the most important thing is not policies. It is, as you say, beating Trump. But people have very different opinions on what's needed. And do you think that's why Democrats are so fractured right now? - because each candidate has some weaknesses when you look at that equation.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Right. There is no perfect candidate. What we're seeing over and over again is there still is a high number of undecided voters. It may be one reason why the turnout was less than had been predicted in Iowa. I think on another level that voters are exhausted by the trauma of Washington.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: When you're in the room with other Democrats, I imagine the debates must be pretty heated. People have their preferences. What does it sound and look like? I mean, are you worried about...\n\nFULLER CLARK: Well, I think...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...The unity of the party?\n\nFULLER CLARK: No. I think everybody is unified on the issue that we cannot allow Trump a second term and that everybody is going to come together at the end of the primary with whoever the candidate is.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We will have to wait and see. That is New Hampshire state Senator Martha Fuller Clark.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nFULLER CLARK: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

He's Not The Palestinian President, But He Played One On TV\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Schifrin/NPR Nick Schifrin/NPR\n\nThe streets are packed on a recent Saturday afternoon in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government in the West Bank. As he weaves through the families and shoppers, 24-year-old Waad Qannam is the center of attention.\n\nDana Adiq, 27, stops Qannam to call him strong, cultured and intellectual.\n\nTasneem Hushiyea, who is 25, asks for his plans to help young Palestinians.\n\nAnd 23-year-old Annas Karoty addresses him by his title: The president of Palestine.\n\nQannam smiles brightly, but also a little bashfully. He's not the real Palestinian president. He just played one on TV.\n\nIn June, he won a TV show called The President, a reality show similar to American Idol. But instead of voting for its favorite singer, the Palestinian audience voted via text message for its favorite would-be leader.\n\nQannam beat out a diverse mix of 23 other contestants, who held election rallies and critiqued sitting ministers. He is from East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope will be the capital of a future state, and is the son of refugees — two traits he says made him popular in the West Bank.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Schifrin/NPR Nick Schifrin/NPR\n\nWhen he won, he dropped to his knees and cried.\n\nI felt that that moment was the key to giving the youth a chance to participate in Palestinian politics, Qannam says.\n\nThe show, broadcast on the Maan satellite network, was popular — and he is recognized on the streets of Ramallah — in part because he's the closest Palestinians have gotten to choosing a leader in more than a decade. The real president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a five-year term.\n\nThe program The President sends a very strong message to the [Palestinian] leadership and says, there is a real need for the democratic process, Qannam says. The second message that it gives is the interest on the part of the youth to participate in making their ideas heard.\n\n\n\nSeventy percent of Palestinians are under 30, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, and many describe themselves as politically starved. They're frustrated not only by a lack of elections but also by a lack of political and economic development. Some accuse the Palestinian leadership of being focused only on keeping itself and its closest supporters in power.\n\nThose age 18 and older will get their chance to make their voices heard Oct. 8. That's when Palestinians are scheduled to hold their first contested elections in 11 years. They will choose 416 spots on local councils, which help elect mayors and other local officials and help administer services such as power and water.\n\nAs of now, the election will include both major parties — Fatah, which largely runs the Palestinian Authority from Ramallah, and Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States.\n\nBut there are no plans for either a Palestinian legislative or presidential election.\n\nKaroty, who met Qannam during the show's taping and considers him a friend, calls the current Palestinian leadership out of touch.\n\nIt is time for us to get rid of people who have been sitting for years and have not done much for the people, Karoty says. Concerning the ones that have been keeping their seats as mayors and others for many, many years, we want to get rid of those people.\n\nQannam — perhaps trying out a politician's answer — is more diplomatic.\n\nWe do not seek to cancel the role of the older generation, says Qannam, who is a member of Fatah. We rather want to encourage our role, to find a role for us.\n\nHe says he met with Abbas and urged him to install a quota among the municipal representatives for young members. He says he has not heard back.\n\nThe only time that I will feel that the youth have an impact in Palestinian politics, Qannam says, is when I see the youth of Fatah or other parties playing a practical role in the running of the affairs of the country.\n\nIn the nearby Amari refugee camp, 29-year-old Mohannad Samara doubts that will ever happen. Between customers at his mirror and glass shop, he explains that he's an Islamist and fears that Hamas and other Islamist groups won't be allowed to fully participate.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad said our victory comes through the engagement of the youth, Samara says. But if Islamist youth gets engaged in the upcoming elections, they will either get arrested or cornered.\n\nHe believes the Palestinian Authority, run by Abbas, and Israel will team up to block young Islamists, either by preventing them from voting, arresting their members or not respecting the results of the vote.\n\nIt will be the first and foremost the Palestinian Authority that will block the youth, he says, and whatever the Palestinian Authority cannot carry out on its own, Israel will do it for them.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Israel's internal security services announced it arrested Hamas' election committee representative, accusing him of being a threat to local security. Hamas accused Israel of trying to influence the election.\n\nQannam is trying to fight youth cynicism. He stands in a group of young Palestinians in Ramallah, and 16-year-old Jihad Adnan asks him how he will increase youth participation in politics.\n\nQannam tries to convince them their voices will be heard. He is only a few moments into his pitch when he's interrupted by Hushiyea. She says she is desperate to talk to any leader, even a TV president. She challenges Qannam and asks how he could prevent nepotism.\n\nQannam seems prepared for that question.\n\nThe only way to deal with the issue of nepotism, he says, is to make Palestinian institutions bigger and put the right person and the most qualified person in that job.\n\nHe smiles and admits he might even run himself.
Reporter: White House Knew Of Coronavirus' 'Major Threat,' But Response Fell Short\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.\n\nDan Diamond, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.\n\nDAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.\n\nI think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.\n\nThe president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.\n\nAnd then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.\n\nBut at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. As I was walking into the studio, Terry, I saw the European Union had put out a statement slamming the U.S. for taking this step without even informing them.\n\nGROSS: What are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.\n\nGROSS: We seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. The NBA suspended the season. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. So have we reached a new stage? And what does that mean?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in many ways, the World Health Organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. This virus is here. It is around the world. It is spreading. It is putting many people at risk.\n\nBut I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. A lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the United States.\n\nAt the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of Americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.\n\nGROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?\n\nDIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.\n\nCities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.\n\nBut at this point, we do not have, from the White House, any clear directive on what the country should do. And with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.\n\nGROSS: You know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the Trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. What went wrong?\n\nDIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.\n\nThe CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.\n\nGROSS: And it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.\n\nDIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.\n\nGROSS: Why didn't the U.S. use the World Health Organization's test?\n\nDIAMOND: If you or your listeners know the answer to that, I would love...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.\n\nGROSS: It's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the United States is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.\n\nDIAMOND: I think at this point, Terry, South Korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the United States has done in the past two months. South Korea can do 10,000 tests per day. At last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.\n\nGROSS: What do you think the impact is of the lost time?\n\nDIAMOND: I think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and I think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. We are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the United States. If there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.\n\nSome of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S DERVISH)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?\n\nDIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.\n\nAt the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.\n\nAnd I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.\n\nGROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.\n\nAnd when I look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. The president has driven a lot of those people away. That has weakened the response across government. It has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. And in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.\n\nGROSS: Are there cuts the Trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? For example, wasn't there a National Security Council health task force that was disbanded under Trump?\n\nDIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.\n\nGROSS: Something I found very interesting - and I'd love to hear your take on this - is that Tucker Carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on Fox News - he has been one of Trump's strongest advocates. And Trump seems to listen, you know, to watch Tucker Carlson's show. So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself. What do you make of that?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.\n\nThe president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. After a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WOJCIECHOWSKI'S TWIRL)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.\n\nSo how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.\n\nDIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.\n\nWhat's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.\n\nGROSS: What is it about his management style that's so alienating?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. But his critics would say that Alex Azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.\n\nGROSS: My impression is that he is anti-abortion. He has described HHS as the department of life. He described the Trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. He said that in a very admiring way. How has that affected him as the leader of HHS? And was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?\n\nDIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.\n\nWhat that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.\n\nGROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.\n\nDIAMOND: Oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.\n\nGROSS: OK. Thank you for the (laughter) clarification. So how does their desire to please Trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? And that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.\n\nDIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nMore recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Azar has been the point person on President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices. Azar has pitched himself as the fixer. He worked in the drug industry at Eli Lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.\n\nWhen the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, and he's been covering the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nSo you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?\n\nDIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.\n\nBut at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a look at Robert Redfield, who's the head of the Centers for Disease Control. And he was a well-known AIDS researcher, and you say he was a favorite of Christian conservatives when Trump appointed him in 2018. He helped fight HIV-AIDS in Africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nDIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.\n\nThose views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.\n\nGROSS: So is there a decision, for better or worse, that Redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the U.S. for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.\n\nGROSS: Vice President Pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. Seema Verma, who is the head of Medicare and Medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of Indiana. Jerome Adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the Pence administration. When Alex Azar was in Indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he became connected to Mike Pence.\n\nSo it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.\n\nDIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.\n\nWhile Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.\n\nBut I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' SMALL PLANET)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico. He investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nIn your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?\n\nDIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.\n\nAnd the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.\n\nThat story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back. I'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.\n\nGROSS: What's another?\n\nDIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.\n\nBehind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.\n\nGROSS: Like on fighting the virus, not on fighting for his job (laughter).\n\nDIAMOND: Yes, on fighting the threat to the American people, not fighting who has which title.\n\nGROSS: Is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the U.S.?\n\nDIAMOND: The information that I have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. One reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.\n\nIn a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.\n\nThe efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. There's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.\n\nGROSS: All right, well, thank you so much for your reporting, and thank you for being on our show.

Wolf sets goal for Pa. to cut greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAmy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGov. Tom Wolf has set a new goal for the state to combat climate change: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025.\n\nLong-term, the governor wants to see an 80-percent reduction by 2050.\n\nHe announced the goals Tuesday in Pittsburgh, saying they are based off the state's 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels.\n\nWe're about halfway there, which means we have work to do, he said.\n\nThe goals stem from the state's draft Climate Action Plan, released in November by the Department of Environmental Protection. The draft states that if every state and nation met comparable goals, global temperature rise could be kept below the 2-degree Celsius threshold that experts say is necessary to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change.\n\nIn his announcement, Wolf called for more wind and solar energy. He said he is open to beefing up the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — which requires utilities to buy certain amounts of power from alternative sources — though that would require the Republican-controlled legislature to act.\n\nWolf also cited recent efforts already underway to reduce emissions, such as a proposed rule to cut methane emissions from natural gas well sites and a new law bolstering in-state solar energy.\n\nWolf did not say whether the state should act to help the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power generation does not release carbon emissions, but it's struggling to compete with cheap natural gas and renewables.\n\nI haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, Wolf said.\n\nAsked about emissions tied to the state's growing petrochemical industry — including an ethane cracker plant under construction in Beaver County — he indicated his support for the industry.\n\nWolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like Shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.\n\nIf you want an either-or situation, I'm not your guy, he said. I want to do both. I want to have an energy efficient future, I want to have a strong environment and I want to have a good economy in Pennsylvania, and I think we can do all of those things.\n\nThe shift away from coal-fired electricity to natural gas power generation has helped the state achieve greenhouse gas reductions below its 2005 levels, according to the state's draft climate action plan.\n\nWe encourage policymakers, including Gov. Wolf, to support common-sense energy and climate-related solutions that encourage responsible natural gas production and use given the overwhelmingly clear benefits of this American resource, said David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade group for Pennsylvania's natural gas industry.\n\nMany environmental groups praised Wolf's emissions reduction goals, including the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nAndrew Williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for EDF, said Wolf's efforts to cut methane emissions are a good step. To achieve major reductions, he said he would like to see even more action.\n\nThere needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.\n\nA program like that would set a limit on the state's emissions and allow companies to buy or sell allowances based on what they emit. Other northeast states have joined together to form a regional cap-and-trade program, but Pennsylvania is not a member.\n\nSome environmental groups urged the governor to be far more ambitious in setting goals. Food & Water Watch, for one, said the state should aim for 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 with significant job growth in clean energy.\n\nWolf on Tuesday also announced the GreenGov Council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. The council has several of its own targets:\n\nA 3 percent reduction in overall energy consumption per year.\n\nReplace 25 percent of the state car fleet with electric vehicles by 2025.\n\nOffset at least 40 percent of the commonwealth's annual electricity usage with renewable energy.\n\nEditor's Picks
Trump Hosts Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump wants to see Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace deal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There is no reason there's not peace between Israel and the Palestinians, none whatsoever.\n\nINSKEEP: And today, President Trump hosts Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House. We're going to talk about this with Ghaith al-Omari, who is here in our studios. He served in various positions within the Palestinian Authority. Thanks for coming by.\n\nGHAITH AL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: Is President Trump, from a Palestinian point of view, an honest broker?\n\nAL-OMARI: You know, the issue of an honest broker is not an issue that the Palestinians think about too much. For the Palestinians, the U.S. is an effective broker. And that's much more important than things like honest or in certain such abstract concepts.\n\nINSKEEP: And so are you hopeful that President Trump is a person who could move Israelis and Palestinians toward a two-state solution or a solution? He doesn't seem to care what the solution is.\n\nAL-OMARI: What is very clear is that he is committed towards doing something. What is less clear is how he is going to do it. Things are complicated. The issues are complicated. There is no trust between the leaders. And on the Palestinian side, at least, there are domestic political problems that can be an obstacle and so in Israel. So unless we deal with these, I don't see how we can move forward.\n\nINSKEEP: I guess one of the domestic political problems is whether Mahmoud Abbas is really the leader of the Palestinians, given that Hamas has great power, and he doesn't control all the territory.\n\nAL-OMARI: That's one of the problems, the Hamas-PA split with Hamas controlling Gaza, the PA, the West Bank. But even within the West Bank itself, there are challenges to his legitimacy from his own political party. There has been no election for around 14 years now. So these are all issues that has to - have to be dealt with before we can actually make the difficult decisions needed for peace to be achieved.\n\nINSKEEP: So President Trump from the outside can seem to have evolved on this. He started out in the campaign saying, first thing when I'm elected, I'm going to move the Israeli - the embassy, the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which would effectively recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Then he backed off of that. Then he advised Israel against building more settlements. What's happening to the president?\n\nAL-OMARI: I think what's happening is when you sit in that office, you realize that there are complexities, there are national interest concerns that you simply don't see from the outside. And I think his policy, whether to this conflict or to the Middle East in general, has evolved as he saw the complexities and what is at stake for the United States in the region.\n\nINSKEEP: You think he saw the complexities. You think he actually has learned and changed here?\n\nAL-OMARI: What we see right now is indications that we have a more realistic, more grounded policy, at least that's the indications. Whether this will be turned into concrete policies, it's too early to tell. It's only been three months. But certainly the trajectory is very different from what we see - what we saw from Trump as a candidate versus Trump the president.\n\nINSKEEP: What's the role of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner?\n\nAL-OMARI: That's also quite vague at the moment. He's in charge of the file, but he has remained very silent about it. The day-to-day management is done by the president's peace envoy, Mr. Jason Greenblatt. Kushner remains as the overall figure. But we have not seen any direct engagement from him, so it remains a bit murky.\n\nINSKEEP: Assuming that this does end up as a two-state solution, if it were to, let me just ask one bottom-line question. There are people who doubt whether Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu is serious about endorsing a two-state solution even though he's formally endorsed it. Of course, the opposite question is posed to President Abbas.\n\nWhen I've moved around the West Bank, I see maps of Palestine - Palestine including all of Israel. Are Palestinians really ready to recognize Israel as a country, and as Israelis would want, as a Jewish state?\n\nAL-OMARI: I think if the right conditions are there, if the right package that includes resolution of all of the issues is there, Palestinians would be ready. Will they fall in love with Israel? Most likely not. Will we have a peace that is stable? I think so. Look at the peace that Israel had with Egypt and Jordan.\n\nEgyptians and Jordanians are no big fans of Israel, yet the peace itself stuck. If the two sides get their interests met - their interests for the Palestinians is about independence and dignity - they would be - you would have a stable peace deal. For the Israelis, it's about security and recognition. You get these components, you get a peace. Peace is not about love. It's about accommodation.\n\nINSKEEP: A cold peace, as people have said.\n\nAL-OMARI: A cold peace is better than a warm conflict.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Ghaith al-Omari, thank you very much for coming by, really appreciate it.\n\nAL-OMARI: Thank you for having me.\n\nINSKEEP: He is currently with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Critics Say Israel's Nation State Law Discriminates Against Religious Minorities\n\nIsrael passed a law last month that is still causing controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. The Druze religious minority held a weekend protest.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nIsrael passed a law last month that continues to cause controversy. The Nation State law defines Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Critics say this law discriminates against religious minorities like Muslims and Christians who make up about a fifth of the Israeli population. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv, this law is sparking protest from a religious group that's one of Israel's staunchest supporters.\n\nDANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: The Druze religious minority in Israel held an unprecedented protest this weekend. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's main square chanting the Hebrew word for equality - shivayon (ph).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Shivayon. Shivayon. Shivayon.\n\nESTRIN: The Druze are a religious group, an offshoot of Islam. They're ethnic Arabs. But unlike most other Arab citizens, they've committed to serving in the Israeli army. They get a lot of praise from Israeli leaders, and they're outspoken Israeli patriots, which is why it was unusual for the Israeli Druze community's religious leader, sheikh Moafaq Tarif, to say this at the protest.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nMOAFAQ TARIF: (Through interpreter) Despite our unquestioned loyalty to the country, the country does not see us as equal.\n\nESTRIN: After impassioned debate, Israeli lawmakers narrowly passed the Nation State law last month. The law downgrades the Arabic language in Israel from official to special status and commits resources to Jewish settlement. Critics say that could lead to an unequal distribution of land and resources. Palestinian-Arab citizens have long complained of discrimination, but the Druze community's outcry is something new.\n\nANWAR SAEB: They put all the Jewish under this law and others out of this law.\n\nESTRIN: Anwar Saeb is one of the senior Druze reserve army officers leading the protest. He heads a company that produces drones for the Israeli military. He served in the army for 27 years and commanded an infantry unit.\n\nSAEB: I was injured three times in Lebanon, in Gaza and in the West Bank - my hand, my chest and my ears.\n\nESTRIN: He's part of a Druze delegation that's been meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSAEB: I told the prime minister that we are not guests here. We are the real citizens, and we do actually the whole commitments. And we need to get all the rights.\n\nESTRIN: Netanyahu defended the new Nation State law yesterday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking in Hebrew).\n\nESTRIN: He said the law does not infringe upon individual rights of citizens but does prevent collective national rights for non-Jews. He said the law would ensure Israel accepts Jewish immigrants while preventing Palestinian noncitizens from gaining citizenship. Israeli columnist Shmuel Rosner says many Israelis support the law, partly in reaction to international activists leading a boycott campaign against Israel.\n\nSHMUEL ROSNER: A sense within Israel and among many Israelis that there is a growing tendency to delegitimize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, to somehow argue that even being a nation-state is in some way not legitimate. So many Israelis feel as if Israel is under siege, and they felt the need to make a statement.\n\nESTRIN: Netanyahu has tried to smooth things over with the Druze community. He's proposed laws to invest in the community and to guarantee benefits for religious minorities who serve in the military. But he has not agreed to a Druze demand to amend the Nation State law with language ensuring equality for all minorities. Druze representative Saeb is torn.\n\nSAEB: Now the country going very, very extreme to the right. It's not good for this country. This is a democratic country. It's a great country. I want to still live in Israel. It's my country. I love this country. My son today is in the army.\n\nESTRIN: Druze protesters have found allies among some former top military and defense officials, including from the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies who came to this weekend's protest. The Jewish Federations of North America, a nonpartisan umbrella group of U.S. Jewish communities, offered rare criticism of Israeli policy. It says the Nation State law is, quote, a step back for all minorities. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Living Well Now: What Does It Take?\n\nRandall Curren is a professor of philosophy at the University of Rochester. His work spans sustainability studies, the philosophy and psychology of well-being, social and political philosophy, and ancient Greek philosophy. You can follow his work here.\n\nParenting, teaching and leading all require us to believe in the prospects for living well on this planet — and to have confidence in our capacity to equip others to live well without destroying those prospects for others.\n\nThese roles require us to both hold these beliefs and to be spokespersons for the world — ones who can make our belief in a future of opportunity credible to those we must raise, teach and lead.\n\nWhatever forms these endeavors might take in the absence of such credible belief and confidence, they would not succeed in their proper ends. They would not enable the human beings we influence to live well together.\n\nHowever, as a society we have barely begun to think about what is essential to preserving opportunity to live well.\n\nOur policies have been dominated by the idea that a growing economy is what best enables everyone to find happiness in their own way, even as evidence has mounted that the damaging impact of human activities on planetary systems makes the explosive economic growth of recent decades unsustainable. The emergence of sustainability science, movement toward a post-carbon economy, and greater consideration of the environmental impacts of personal and institutional decisions are all signs that we are at least beginning to come to grips with the reality that we cannot persist in destabilizing the natural systems on which humanity relies without suffering severe and ultimately irreversible consequences.\n\nThe recognition that preserving opportunities to live well requires preserving the integrity of the natural systems on which we rely is a critical first step. Identifying the distinct forms of human impact and critical thresholds or planetary boundaries is an important further step that has been underway for some time. Nine such boundaries have been identified, including safe rates of biodiversity loss, nitrogen removal from the atmosphere, phosphorus flowing into the oceans, consumption of freshwater, and land cover converted to cropland. From a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the Paris climate accord.\n\nWithin the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. A central argument of my book, Living Well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously — and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.\n\nA central feature of Americans' understanding and promotion of opportunity to live well has been a focused on fair terms of access to employment. Promoting fair competition for employment and equal access to the education and training needed to acquire job qualifications makes sense.\n\nHowever, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. The evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. Comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. Nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.\n\nTo make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. And we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. Those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).\n\nSo what is inherently involved in living well?\n\nIn addressing this question, my geoscientist coauthor Ellen Metzger and I have had the benefit of collaborations with psychologist colleagues, Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. Their research in self-determination theory, conducted over the course of four decades with a network of 500 collaborators in 39 countries, has found that the experience of happiness is regulated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs to feel competent, self-determining, and positively related to other people in the activities of one's life. These are universal needs, observed across all stages of life and in every culture in which studies have been conducted, and they help explain the truth in the ancient ideal of eudaimonia, or human flourishing.\n\nAccording to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. My work with Ryan and Deci identifies three broad forms of potential — social, intellectual, and productive/creative — the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. Fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.\n\nA related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. Societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. It should be evident to any observer of life in the U.S. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most Americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may seem, we could be happier both now and in the future if we could overcome the blind faith in wealth accumulation that shaped the socially, politically and environmentally unstable world with which we must now contend.
Bloomberg Promises $15 Million To Help Make Up For U.S. Withdrawal From Climate Deal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christophe Ena/AP Christophe Ena/AP\n\nMichael Bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.\n\nAmericans will honor and fulfill the Paris Agreement by leading from the bottom up — and there isn't anything Washington can do to stop us, said Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who now serves as the U.N.'s special envoy on cities and climate change.\n\nMayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing [on to] a statement of support that we will submit to the U.N., Bloomberg said, and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the U.S. made in Paris in 2015.\n\nDozens of cities have said they are committed to the Paris climate accord, with at least 86 mayors signing a statement saying they will adopt and uphold the agreement's goals.\n\nUnder the Paris accord, the U.S. sent some $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund that is guided by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. The U.S. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but Trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.\n\nBloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the U.N.'s climate change agency.\n\nWe are grateful to Bloomberg Philanthropies for this generous contribution, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a news release about the funding pledge.\n\nWhile government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\n\nThe announcement follows Trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that nearly 200 nations agreed to in late 2015. As NPR has reported, the only other countries not part of the agreement are Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which argued that the Paris accord did not go far enough to curb global emissions.\n\nThe architects of the Paris Agreement included Christiana Figueres, who until recently led the UNFCCC.\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris deal sparked pledges of money and solidarity, Figueres said via Twitter on Friday, Thank you Trump. You have provoked an unparalleled wave of support for Paris and determined resolve on climate action. Deeply grateful.
Republicans Now Poised For Biden-Burisma Subpoena With Romney On Board\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nSen. Mitt Romney has cleared the path for his Republican colleagues to intensify their investigation next week into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter.\n\nThe Utah Republican said Friday that he'll go along with his fellow members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and authorize a subpoena as part of an investigation into what Republicans call potential conflicts of interest from Biden's tenure in office.\n\nRomney had wavered about joining the other Republicans on the panel, who control the majority but would have needed him to break a tie if all the Democrats present opposed a subpoena.\n\nOn Friday, a spokeswoman said that Romney and Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the committee, reached an accord that made Romney comfortable with going along.\n\nSenator Romney has expressed his concerns to Chairman Johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle, said spokeswoman Liz Johnson. He will therefore vote to let the chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.\n\nJohnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have been seeking interviews with witnesses and documents about Hunter Biden for several months. They've contacted the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and a political consultancy, Blue Star Strategies — among others — with requests for responses.\n\nJohnson and Grassley, who is not on the homeland security committee, have said they haven't gotten satisfactory responses to their formal requests, which is why Johnson's committee is expected to begin issuing subpoenas now that Romney is on board.\n\nJohnson wants to subpoena records and an interview from Andrii Telizhenko, a former consultant for Blue Star. The Wisconsin senator says he wants to find out more about accounts that Blue Star, which represented Ukraine, sought access to Hunter Biden in order to gain access to Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time, and to influence the State Department.\n\nThe Republicans' latest actions putting the Biden investigation back into the spotlight have followed Joe Biden's successes in the Democratic primaries, reviving his prospects of becoming the party's presidential nominee.\n\nThe Burisma connection\n\nHunter Biden made lucrative business connections at a time when Joe Biden was handling key foreign policy matters for President Barack Obama.\n\nThe younger Biden was paid as a member of the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and also received payments and, reportedly, gifts from Chinese business counterparts.\n\nThe Bidens traveled together to China aboard Air Force Two during the time Joe Biden was vice president. Johnson and Grassley also have asked DHS, which oversees the Secret Service, whether it has records about other trips they might have made.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign has been embarrassed by the consistent exhumations about that story, but the men haven't been accused of any lawbreaking.\n\nTrump's desire for Ukraine to launch an investigation into the Bidens' activities was one basis for the actions in the Ukraine affair for which he was impeached last year and then acquitted earlier this year.\n\nRomney has played a key role all throughout as one of a handful of Republicans who've been willing to break with Trump. Romney cast the lone GOP vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment in Senate.
Facebook Taps Former Obama Official As Vice President Of Civil Rights\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Facebook Facebook\n\nSocial media behemoth Facebook announced Monday it has created a new executive role at the company and that it will be filled by a veteran of the Obama administration.\n\nRoy Austin Jr. has been named vice president of civil rights with the mandate to oversee Facebook's accountability on racial hatred and discrimination on its platform. He's slated to start Jan. 19.\n\nNaming Austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.\n\nThe auditors had several recommendations, such as calling on Facebook to do more to rein in hateful speech on its platform, and stricter penalties for users who post items that violate company standards.\n\nThe auditors also advised Facebook to create a position to lead the company's efforts on civil rights, even after acknowledging the company had taken several positive steps in that direction. Those included barring advertisers from using tools that target housing, employment and credit ads at individuals based on gender, age or ZIP code.\n\nI am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, Austin said in a statement.\n\nTechnology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it's important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it, he added.\n\nFacebook said Austin will be based out of Washington, D.C.\n\nHe comes from the law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, where he was a partner focusing on criminal defense and civil rights law. Earlier in his career, Austin held several positions within the U.S. Justice Department, including senior assistant U.S. attorney in the Civil Rights Unit of the Washington, D.C., U.S Attorney's office, and deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from 2010 to 2014.\n\nAfter that Austin worked on the White House Domestic Policy Council in the Obama administration. He also worked on President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and was a member of Obama's My Brother's Keeper Task Force.\n\nLaura Murphy, a former American Civil Liberties Union executive, who was hired by Facebook to lead a two-year investigation into the company's polices, applauded Austin's hire.\n\nThe appointment of a Civil Rights Vice President is an historic, positive and timely milestone in the evolution of Facebook, Murphy said in a statement.\n\nRoy Austin is a great choice for this role; I worked with him extensively during his tenure at the White House. I urge Facebook to give him the latitude and resources to tackle the audit recommendations and any other civil rights issues that arise, she added.\n\nJust how much latitude Austin ultimately gets remains to be seen.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, has the final say in any decision made at Facebook.\n\nPressure has been building for Facebook to implement changes to its platform following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police on Memorial Day.\n\nThe audit was released in the immediate weeks following Floyd's killing, just as national protests calling for a reckoning on race, police brutality and social injustice were gaining momentum.\n\nAs NPR's Shannon Bond reported in July, the audit of Facebook came at the same time hundreds of companies pledged to pull advertising from the platform to protest its lax approach to policing harmful posts.\n\nBond also reported at the time that advocacy groups, including Color of Change, the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League held a conference call with Facebook executives to press for change, but hung up disappointed with the social media network's response.\n\nThey showed up to the meeting expecting an 'A' for attendance, Rashad Robinson, President of Color of Change told NPR at the time.\n\nEditor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.\n\nNPR's Shannon Bond contributed to this report.
President-Elect Trump Eyes Rex Tillerson As Possible Secretary Of State\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nThis weekend, reports emerged saying the CIA believes Russian hacking during the U.S. presidential election was intended to sway the election in favor of Donald Trump. The president-elect had this to say on Fox News this morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know why. And I think it's just, you know, they talk about all sorts of things. Every week, it's another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\n\nCHANG: Joining us now to talk more about Russian hacking and Trump's possible pick for secretary of state is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: So what do you make of Trump's reaction to the latest news on the Russian hacking?\n\nLIASSON: Well, it was pretty extraordinary. He rejected the consensus view of the intelligence community, that Russia wasn't just interfering in the elections to sow chaos, actually trying to put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump. He put out an official statement - not a tweet - where he insulted the intelligence community, said these are the same people who brought us flawed intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction. He also suggested this morning that President Obama might be trying to undercut his win, which, although it was decisive and even stunning, it was certainly not historic landslide, as Trump just described it, because his 306 electoral votes rank him 46th out of 58 Electoral College victories.\n\nThe other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. He said in that interview on Fox, he says I'm a very smart person. I don't need briefings every day. I don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. And that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about China or North Korea or Iran? Is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?\n\nCHANG: There was also some reaction from Congress this morning. We saw a statement from a bipartisan group of senators. They said this is not a partisan issue. What do you make of that?\n\nLIASSON: Well, what I make of it is there's not only a big breach between Trump and the intelligence community. There's also a breach between Trump and a bipartisan group of senators on Capitol Hill who say there should be hearings. There was the initial reaction from some Republicans where they didn't want to undermine Trump's victory, but other Republicans want to get to the bottom of this. They consider this a cyberattack. They don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. We also have the report that the Obama administration has asked for to be completed before Obama leaves office. That means it would probably come out right before Trump's inauguration.\n\nCHANG: OK. So now let's talk about the secretary of state nomination. The front-runner now, according to multiple news outlets, is oil executive Rex Tillerson. He's the CEO of ExxonMobil. No confirmation yet, but if Trump chooses Tillerson, what would that say about his foreign policy plans, and what does that signal to the rest of the world?\n\nLIASSON: I think it signals that he might be ready to break with 70 years of bipartisan foreign policy consensus about America's role in the world. Rex Tillerson has been described as the most friendliest-to-Putin American executive. Runs ExxonMobil - ExxonMobil would benefit, of course, if sanctions against Russia for taking Crimea were lifted. Vladimir Putin personally gave Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013. And I think it's raising some alarm bells on the Hill. We have Lindsey Graham and John McCain, two Republican senators, suggesting that Tillerson might have the hardest time of all the Trump national security nominations up in the Senate. They're going to ask him some very tough questions about Russia.\n\nCHANG: NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

How fitting is it that President Trump's first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?\n\nNot that the border crisis is one of Mr. Trump's self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. It may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president's nurturing, become something far more tragic.\n\nPursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.\n\nMr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
The government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.\n\nThat age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.\n\nAfter that, 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy.\n\nThe Times of London reported on four British women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women's families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.\n\nAyaan, 24, who had been at the institution for two years, said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued.\n\nI was left to fend for myself, she told The Times of London. The loan has caused so much anxiety.\n\nJust as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.\n\nIt's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.
TIJUANA, Mexico — Is Donald Trump a conceptual artist?\n\nThat's the intriguing possibility put forth in an online petition Tuesday that seeks to have the group of eight prototypes for Mr. Trump's controversial Mexican border wall designated a national monument.\n\nThe prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last October along the United States border near San Diego. The petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, MAGA (the acronym recalls the President's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as a major Land Art exhibition of significant cultural value.\n\nThe notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. They were designed to United States Customs and Border Protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. Aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture.
BERLIN — Seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, Sebastian Kurz, Austria's former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on Thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive Greens.\n\nWe chose a new path, Mr. Kurz beamed. It was a challenge for both sides, because the differences between the two sides are big.\n\nThe result, he said, was a new kind of compromise. We did not try to negotiate the lowest common denominator but consciously tried to unite the best of both worlds, Mr. Kurz said. That's how it is possible that both the Greens could keep their central campaign promises and so could the People's Party.\n\nWerner Kogler, the Greens leader, who will serve as vice chancellor, put it more bluntly: We were elected for different things.
As a boy, Bradley Scott Silverbush had a knack for breaking up schoolyard fights in his hometown, Syracuse. His strategy was simple: Collect $1 from the child who was about to be pummeled and split his winnings with the bully to end the dispute.\n\nFrom these grade-school negotiations Mr. Silverbush acquired some valuable information. I knew from second grade that I wanted to be a lawyer, he said.\n\nNow 60, he is a senior litigation member at Rosenberg & Estis, a top landlord law firm in New York. And he is still negotiating for the bigger kids on the playground; he lists among his clients Douglas Elliman and Carnegie Management.\n\nIt would not be difficult for many people to revile a landlord lawyer, yet over dinner at the Palm Too, a Midtown East steakhouse near his apartment, this lawyer with a penchant for racecars came across as unexpectedly likable as he told stories in sometimes off-color language about risks he has taken, like racing at 140 miles per hour on the interstate but talking himself out of a traffic ticket.
President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan urged China on Tuesday to seek a peaceful solution to its differences with Taiwan and stressed that the island's people want to maintain self-rule.\n\nSpeaking a day before China's leader, Xi Jinping, was expected to make a major speech about Taiwan, Ms. Tsai said that China must respect the freedom and democracy of Taiwan's 23 million people. Her remarks came amid a shift in the island's political landscape, with Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party having suffered major losses in local elections in November. Candidates who favor closer ties with China won mayoral contests in Taiwan's four largest cities.\n\nI must emphasize, the results of the past election absolutely do not represent that the will of the people at the grass-roots level seeks to give up our sovereignty, she said in a New Year's Day address. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory that must be united with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nThe Chinese government, Ms. Tsai said, must handle our differences peacefully and as equals.\n\nThat set of differences amounts to one of Asia's biggest potential flash points. Since Ms. Tsai came to power in 2016, China has ramped up pressure on her government. It has increased patrols by military aircraft, sent bombers to circle the island and sailed an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.
LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the Caribbean island of Mustique, still basking in the glow of his recent election victory, when the news came last Friday that President Trump had ordered the killing of a powerful Iranian general — without tipping off, let alone consulting, his British ally.\n\nThe British government was livid about the lack of notice, according to current and former officials, particularly because there are about 400 British troops deployed in Iraq, and Britain has historically been more closely aligned with the United States on combat operations there than any other country.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson held his tongue until Sunday evening, after he returned to London. Even then, he issued a carefully worded four-paragraph statement that said he would not lament the killing of the general, Qassim Suleimani, warned Iran against reprisals and said nothing about Mr. Trump's action.\n\nIt was a circumspect reaction for a politician not known for his circumspection, and it underscored Mr. Johnson's predicament as he confronts what is arguably the first foreign policy crisis of the post-Brexit era.
Patrick Chevallereau, a former French military officer now at RUSI, a defense research institution in London, said that the Trump call shows that the current president is in a mind-set to do anything — absolutely anything — before Jan. 20. There is zero standard, zero reference, zero ethics. He added: Everything else than himself can be destroyed and collapse, including us.\n\nThomas Wright, an Irish-born expert on America at the Brookings Institution, said that People are worried for real that Trump will come back. The months since the election have shown people just how bad a second term would have been — the guardrails off, a completely personalized government and giving voice to his authoritarian tendencies, he said.\n\nNow the rest of the world understands that Trump could actually make a comeback in 2024, so that is a shadow that he will cast over American politics, Mr. Wright said.\n\nWorld leaders all know that Trump is sort of crazy, but it's the extremity of his actions, the lengths to which he has gone, that he got 74 million votes and is not retiring but will be a force for the Republicans that is disconcerting, he added. People knew what Trump is like, but the importance is the shadow of the future.\n\nAlso troubling to many is the letter that the last 10 living secretaries of defense all signed urging the nation — and the military — to accept that the election is over and the time for questioning the results has passed.\n\nJean-Marie Guéhenno, a former diplomat and the former president of the International Crisis Group, asked on Twitter: Should we be reassured on U.S. democracy when 10 former defense secretaries warn against use of the military to dispute election results, or terrified that they believe taking a public stance has become necessary?

Pamela Anderson walks down a city street and uses her cellphone to book a ride. Along the way, she passes a newspaper and street signs that say, Hollywood Sexual Harassment Scandal Reaches New Lows and U.S. Senator Accused of Groping. When she gets into the car, she sees another sign that says, Ride-Hail Drivers Suspected of Rape. The car doors lock, and the driver turns around and suggestively asks, Shall we? Just then, #MeToo pops up on her phone's screen.\n\nWhen you accept a ride from a ride-hail app, you also accept the risks that come with it, Ms. Anderson says in a voice-over. Many ride-hail companies consider their drivers third-party providers, so they don't have to accept any responsibility or accountability for their actions. Always ride responsibly.\n\nThe 60-second ad, to be released Monday, is the third in a campaign introduced in 2015 by the National Limousine Association to promote Ride Responsibly, an initiative that encourages riders to think before you app.\n\nIt is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which happen to be its competitors. In November, for instance, two women sued Uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in Florida and California. And last month an Uber driver in Beirut, Lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of Rebecca Dykes, a British diplomat.
ILSI does not profess to have been perfect in our 40-year history, the statement said. Not surprisingly, there have been bumps along the way. This is why ILSI has analyzed best practices and has committed to ensuring scientific integrity in nutrition and food sector research.\n\nCoca-Cola said in a statement that it had also been changing the way it funded scientific research through greater transparency and by ending its practice of providing the lion's share of money for studies. In recent years, it added, Coca-Cola has sought to address mounting obesity in China by offering an array of new sugar-free beverages and through improved nutrition labeling on products. We recognize that too much sugar isn't good for anyone, it said.\n\nProfessor Greenhalgh's findings were based on interviews with Chinese officials and scientists, and a review of public documents produced by Coca-Cola and ILSI.\n\nShe said the industry efforts have been wildly successful, in part because China lacks a free media or watchdog organizations that might have been critical of the relationship.\n\nIn just a few decades, China has gone from a nation plagued by food shortages to one buffeted by soaring obesity and chronic diseases tied to poor diet. More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. In Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.\n\nThe increases closely follow growing prosperity in China that began in the 1980s as Beijing embraced market economics after decades of isolation. In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first companies allowed into the country, and ILSI arrived soon afterward. Seeking to identify influential scientists it could work with, the group found a partner in Chen Chunming, a leading nutritionist who was the founding president of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the forerunner of China's C.D.C.\n\nIn 1993, Ms. Chen became the head of ILSA-China and she remained a senior adviser to the organization until her death last year. Professors Greenhalgh and Popkin said that Ms. Chen was instrumental in stymying attempts to address soaring obesity by stressing the harmful impact of consuming highly processed food and sugary soft drinks.
What election objectors could cost their corporate donors\n\nAny remaining notions that the presidential transition would go smoothly were shattered this weekend when 11 Republican senators announced that they would not certify Joe Biden's Electoral College victory during a joint Congressional session on Wednesday. At the same time, President Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to find enough votes to flip the state to him, on a Saturday phone call that was recorded. (That said, the prospect of a constitutional crisis hasn't rattled markets: U.S. futures are up this morning.)\n\nThe group of senators, led by Ted Cruz of Texas, will call for an emergency audit of election results in disputed states, without citing specific evidence of fraud. (There's also Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had already promised to dispute the result.) Scores of Republican House members also plan to reject the count, attracting strong condemnation and setting off infighting in the party. And companies whose political arms donated to these lawmakers' campaigns now face accusations of funding their maneuvers.\n\nHow businesses are being linked with this gambit. The senators rejecting the election count include Steve Daines of Montana, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Roger Marshall of Kansas, who ran and won their seats in 2020. Their major campaign contributors included corporate political action committees, which collect and distribute employee contributions, based on data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Here are some examples:\n\nAn Exxon Mobil PAC contributed $10,000 to Ms. Lummis. In a statement to DealBook, the company said we congratulate President-elect Biden on his election. Ms. Lummis also received money from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce PAC. The trade association congratulated Mr. Biden on Nov. 7. It did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Chevron PAC donated $10,000 to Mr. Daines. The company acknowledged in a written statement that it engages with many people and organizations that take positions that are not always aligned with all their views, and said it looks forward to engaging with President-elect Biden and his team.\n\nMr. Daines and Mr. Marshall received $10,000 each from a Goldman Sachs PAC. The bank has warned that sowing doubt about the orderly transfer of power threatens the economy. It did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApollo Global Management's PAC contributed $10,000 to Mr. Hagerty. The firm did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe challenge isn't expected to delay the inauguration on Jan. 20, but it turns a routine process into a political showdown. Those who spoke up against the move did so in stark terms:\n\nThe voters have spoken, said Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah, in a statement also signed by some Democratic colleagues. Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican, circulated a 21-page memo to House colleagues explaining why the move sets an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\n\nThe former House speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement that the challenges strike at the foundation of our republic, adding that it is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act.\n\nAll 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in a joint op-ed that the time for questioning the results has passed.\n\nThe rebellion could affect future corporate donations. In a new ad, the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump Republican group, accused Mr. Cruz and Mr. Hawley — as well as Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have promoted the president's election fraud contentions but haven't committed to the certification challenge — of attempting to suppress millions of votes, and called out the corporate America titans who are funding them, naming AT&T, Charles Schwab and Citigroup. If that creates reputational issues, companies may think twice about donations to challengers in 2022 — and beyond.\n\nImage\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford goes into use. Britain began inoculations with the shot, which has also received emergency approval in India. Scientists are increasingly immersed in debates about vaccination policy, including whether to delay booster doses to give more first shots faster.
The British government on Friday issued new guidance encouraging health care providers to use two arthritis drugs to treat severely sick Covid-19 patients, following the release of promising data from a clinical trial that has not yet undergone formal scientific review.\n\nThe findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among Covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. Based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 I.C.U. patients treated early with these drugs. All of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.\n\nI think it's a huge result, said Dr. Anthony Gordon, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Imperial College London and the trial's lead researcher. Showing that drugs that are available and can be used to save lives, in this pandemic, is a wonderful achievement.\n\nThe results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced Covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (Most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
They could include a measure finalized this week to restrict the type of scientific studies the Environmental Protection Agency can use to develop new air and water protections, and another granting liability protection to companies that accidentally kill migratory birds.\n\nThe Trump administration has also rushed in recent weeks to lock in weak pollution rules.\n\nOne such action kept in place Obama-era standards on smog-causing emissions that, even when originally issued, fell short of the standard recommended by public health experts. Another imposed the federal government's first regulation to control planet-warming pollution from airplanes but did not require airlines to go beyond emissions limits that they had set for themselves. And a third updates regulations around lead pipes in a way that environmental critics said falls far short of an overhaul needed to ensure safe drinking water.\n\nThe new balance of power would also make it easier for Mr. Biden's cabinet appointees to win confirmation, as well as for Democrats to increase the budgets of federal agencies and pump money into clean energy research and development. It also would greatly increase the likelihood that Congress would incorporate portions of Mr. Biden's $2 trillion climate plan into new economic stimulus legislation as well as an infrastructure package.\n\nPassage of much major legislation, however, requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, so Democrats would still be forced to compromise with Republicans and would be limited in their ability to pass sweeping new laws, said Robert Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nVictories in both Georgia runoff elections would be important across the board, but it doesn't bring them the ultimate freedom they would have if they had a supermajority in the Senate, Dr. Stavins said.\n\nThe Biden team, meantime, said this week that it had underestimated the damage that the Trump administration had done to climate and environment policy and was keeping all options on the table to bolster federal agencies and the work they do.\n\nThere is hard work ahead to rebuild agencies and our capacities from the ground up and reposition the federal government to be a partner to our workers and communities again — rather than advancing policies that hurt our environment and economy, Gina McCarthy, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to lead a new White House Office of Climate Policy, said in a statement.
Do you remember the winter of debt?\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the U.S. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. You might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.\n\nBut no: Washington was obsessed with debt. The Simpson-Bowles report was the talk of the town. Paul Ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. And between the capital's debt obsession, the Republican takeover of the House, and a hard right turn in state governments, America was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.\n\nSome of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. And we were mostly right. Why only mostly? Because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. The obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.\n\nThat's the message I take from Olivier Blanchard's presidential address to the American Economic Association. To be fair, Blanchard — one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the I.M.F. — was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all MMT and say that debt never matters. But his analysis nonetheless makes the Fix the Debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.
The remarks also reflected the disarray that has surrounded the president's decision, which took his staff and foreign allies by surprise and drew objections from the Pentagon that it was logistically impossible and strategically unwise. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned within hours of the announcement, and the Pentagon chief of staff, Kevin M. Sweeney, said on Saturday evening that he was also leaving.\n\nWhile Mr. Bolton said on Sunday that he expected American forces to eventually leave northeastern Syria, where most of the 2,000 troops in the country are based for the mission against the Islamic State, he began to lay out an argument for keeping some troops at a garrison in the southeast that is used to monitor the flow of Iranian arms and soldiers. In September, three months before Mr. Trump's announcement, Mr. Bolton had declared that the United States would remain in Syria as long as Iranians were on the ground there.\n\nAsked on CBS News's Face the Nation if Mr. Bolton's comments amounted to an admission that Mr. Trump had made a mistake, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who at times has been one of the president's staunchest supporters, said, This is the reality setting in that you've got to plan this out.\n\nMr. Graham, who described the dangers of making the announcement first and then considering the longer-term implications, added, The president is slowing down and is re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives: Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back.\n\nThe move to reverse course on Mr. Trump's promised swift withdrawal picked up in recent days, even as Mr. Bolton worked to avoid openly confronting the president the way Mr. Mattis did. On Friday, in a briefing for reporters about a forthcoming trip to the Middle East by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a senior State Department official said there was no fixed timetable for the American withdrawal.
A bipartisan, if mildly conservative, group of senators has indicated that it will introduce legislation intended to increase the rule-making requirements on Wall Street regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Board.\n\nAs Senator Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has put it, the long-term growth of living standards depends on periodically lightening the regulatory load – the equivalent of scraping barnacles off the bottom.\n\nThe legislation would require more math and permit less flexibility by those regulators. But it would also limit Congress's own ability to require the government to embrace good governance values like transparency and honesty, if the S.E.C.'s most recent rule-making is any guide.\n\nThe senators have suggested that they would impose cost-benefit analysis requirements on America's financial regulators. No important rule could be passed without establishing that the dollar impositions on the financial industry would not be outweighed by the dollar benefits created by the rule.
WASHINGTON — Under increasing pressure to defend the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq, senior Trump administration officials offered new justifications but little detail on Tuesday, citing threats to the American Embassy in Baghdad and intelligence suggesting other imminent attacks that helped prompt the strike.\n\nDemocrats stepped up their criticism of intelligence that the administration provided immediately after the drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The administration's formal notification to Congress, which remains classified, provided no information on future threats or the imminent attack, officials who have read it said.\n\nSeveral said it was improperly classified, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called it vague and unacceptably unspecific. Lawmakers pressed for more answers on Tuesday at an intelligence briefing by administration officials.\n\nIranian forces or their proxies were days from attacking American personnel when President Trump decided to strike General Suleimani, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters at the Pentagon. Mr. Esper added that General Suleimani had traveled to Baghdad to coordinate attacks following up on a two-day siege of the United States Embassy there last week by pro-Iranian demonstrators. He declined to elaborate but called the intelligence exquisite.
To do this, the cabinet and Congress must deploy the 25th Amendment and impeachment in sequence.\n\nFirst, Vice President Pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment in order to make a declaration that Mr. Trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This would immediately suspend, but not remove, Mr. Trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint Mr. Pence as acting president. The 25th Amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.\n\nSecond, the House should quickly draw up and pass articles of impeachment. And then the Senate should hold a fair — but immediate and efficient — trial both to remove President Trump from office and, as important, to disqualify him from serving in public office in the future. Precedent suggests that the Senate would likely need to hold two separate votes on removal and disqualification, although the disqualification vote may require only a simple majority to be approved, as opposed to the two-thirds vote necessary for removal from office.\n\nDisqualification is necessary given Mr. Trump's anti-democratic response to the 2020 election and the continuing danger that he will pose to constitutional norms if allowed to flirt with a return to power in 2024. Indeed, the importance of disqualification in this case is such that the Congress should proceed with impeachment even if Mr. Trump's term in office has already concluded.\n\nA public vote and rapid trial in the Senate would give much-needed legitimacy to actions to remove Mr. Trump from office. By forcing Republicans to stand up for democracy and against the president's actions, it would also reaffirm bipartisan support for the fundamental principles of American democracy. Further, while the 25th Amendment is intended mainly for illness or other objective incapacities, impeachment offers an appropriate moral response to the president's conduct, including incitement to violence and attacks on basic democratic norms.\n\nWhy do this with only about two weeks left in President Trump's term? Because we must defend our democracy for all Americans, now. And we must preserve our democracy for future Americans. We must ensure a field of potential Republican presidential hopefuls in 2024 who have integrity. And we must reassure the world, and especially would-be authoritarian regimes, about what United States policy will be on questions of freedom and self-rule now and in the future.

And we need to march on the Capitol today — Let's have trial by combat. Let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. God bless you, and God bless America. We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history: whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election. All of us take our responsibility seriously. Let's go! I would urge my colleagues, don't take perhaps the easy path. And the Electoral College is the mechanism by which the people select the president. But if Congress gets to decide which states get to vote in the Electoral College, then clearly, Congress is selecting the president, not the people. On the steps of the back side of the Capitol, we're seeing protesters overcome the police. The police are now running back into the Capitol building. Take that House! Take it now! My challenge today is not about the good people of Arizona — [gavel banging] And it will stand in recess until the call of the chair. We'll pause. Protesters are in the building. Thank you.

Bowser of Washington on Wednesday night issued an order extending the city's public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support President Trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation's capital. The order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety. The directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20. It came hours after Ms. Bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday. In a statement explaining the extension, Ms. Bowser pointed to the pro-Trump protesters who came to the city for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns, Ms. Bowser wrote. They have breached the security of the Capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the Capitol. She added that, President Trump continues to fan rage and violence by contending that the Presidential election was invalid, and said, some persons can be expected to continue their violent protests through the inauguration.

This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said as the Senate reconvened. Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the majority leader after Democrats won both of Tuesday's runoffs in Georgia, said that January 6, 2021, was a date that would live in infamy, invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt's phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. He called Mr. Trump's supporters who stormed the building goons and thugs. Moments earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the rioters unhinged and referred to the siege as a failed insurrection. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation, he said.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images President Trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard to quell violent protests at the Capitol, according to a person with knowledge of the events. In the end, it was Vice President Mike Pence, defense and administration officials said, who approved the order to deploy. It was unclear why Mr. Trump, who is still technically the commander in chief, did not give the order. The mobilization was initiated with the help of Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials, according to the person with knowledge of the events. Kash Patel, the chief of staff to Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary, responded: The acting secretary and the president have spoken multiple times this week about the request for National Guard personnel in D.C. During these conversations, the president conveyed to the acting secretary that he should take any necessary steps to support civilian law enforcement requests in securing the Capitol and federal buildings. The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard, an Army official said Wednesday, and Virginia's governor dispatched members of the Virginia Guard along with 200 Virginia State Troopers to quell the violence in the nation's capital.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump. The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office. This is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Both the Senate and House would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. Most of those calling for Mr. Trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were Democrats, but there were some exceptions. Governor Phil Scott, Republican of Vermont, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump should be ousted. The fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress.

Pete Marovich for The New York Times Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump's account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington. Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump's tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. Facebook later said it had assessed two policy violations against Mr. Trump's page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. Twitter said it was acting as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C. This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets, the company said on Twitter. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked. The tweets that were removed repeated Mr. Trump's false claims of election fraud and expressed praise and sympathy for those who had forced their way into the Capitol and disrupted Congress's certification of the election results.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, condemned President Trump on Wednesday night for the breaching of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, saying that the president bore direct responsibility for the violence that disrupted the counting of electoral votes by Congress. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States, Mr. Romney said in a statement. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. Mr. Romney, the lone Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Mr. Trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by Mr. Trump's supporters in recent days. Videos showed one of the president's followers confronting Mr. Romney before a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport earlier this week. He was later heckled by Mr. Trump's supporters aboard a flight. In his statement, Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was because of a selfish man's injured pride. He said that Mr. Trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history, he said of Mr. Trump's supporters. That will be their legacy. Former President George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the Capitol. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name. It is a sickening and heartbreaking sight, Mr. Bush said. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement.

Will Oliver/EPA, via Shutterstock In what could be interpreted as an attempt to stoke the flames of a Capitol mob which has begun to disperse, President Trump sent a tweet at around 6 p.m. in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to remember this day going forward. These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, he tweeted. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever! Twitter later took down the tweet, saying that it had violated the company's rules. Mr. Trump also posted a video in which he repeated his baseless claims of widespread election fraud on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. All three social media sites removed the video.

Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images A woman who was shot inside the Capitol building after it was overrun by a pro-Trump mob has died, Washington D.C. police officials said on Wednesday. The woman has not been identified and no information has been released about who may have shot her. Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department said earlier that she was a civilian and that his officers were leading the investigation. The woman was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for the police department, said in an email. Mr. Sternbeck said he did not yet know who shot her or have any other details. A video posted to Twitter earlier on Wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the Capitol. The woman in the video seemed to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. The woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. A man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of police could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her. Where's she hit? people yelled as blood streamed around her mouth. Read more\n\nJan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET 'I thought we'd have to fight our way out,' a congressman says.

Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Within minutes of the mob breaching the Capitol complex, rioters were pounding on the doors of the House gallery, where a group of lawmakers were trapped. I thought we'd have to fight our way out, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq. Mr. Crow said he moved other members away from the barricaded door inside the gallery, helped them don gas masks, told them to take off the lapel pins assigned to all House members and took out his only possible weapon — a pen. After 15 minutes, he said, Capitol Police and SWAT team members on a rescue mission hustled the members out by clearing a path outside the gallery, above the House floor. With police in the lead, guns drawn, the lawmakers entered a scene of chaos and mayhem, Mr. Crow said. Some police rushed to barricade doors to block rioters. Others pinned protesters to the ground to allow the lawmakers to pass. We heard yelling through the halls, said Mr. Crow, who described bringing up the rear to ensure all the members made it to safety. As police led the members down stairwells and into the subterranean maze of tunnels to a secure location, Mr. Crow said he called his wife, who had been watching the terrifying scene on television from Colorado. Mr. Crow said lawmakers were determined to resume their work in the Capitol on Wednesday night, if possible, once the buildings were cleared of remaining threats.

The logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters, Ms. Cancian said. The best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the Administration for Children and Families, declined to speculate on Southwest Key's grants. In response to a question asking if the agency had a plan if the charity were to lose its grants, a spokeswoman said the agency was always planning for unforeseen events.\n\nA Southwest Key spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the Office of Refugee Resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from Texas, Arizona or California. He said the charity was focused on providing the best care possible for children.\n\nLast year, the government cut off the contracts of another major shelter provider, International Educational Services, over suspected financial improprieties. Juan Sanchez, who founded Southwest Key and still runs it, also helped establish I.E.S., although he has not had a role there for decades.\n\nThe closing of I.E.S. facilities was carried out haphazardly, straining the system for months. As many as 620 children needed to be rehoused; most landed in Southwest Key facilities.\n\nComprehensive Health Services, a for-profit company based in Florida that ran one of the temporary shelters, leased three former I.E.S. shelters, all in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and then received a new government contract. Many original staff members were rehired.
Mr. Johnson followed on Monday evening to announce the lockdown in England that many had predicted was inevitable.\n\nIt's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Mr. Johnson said in a televised address.\n\nThough the weeks ahead may be some of the hardest yet, he said he believed Britain was entering the last phase of the struggle, because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favor of the British people.\n\nPeople in England were being encouraged to obey the new rules immediately, though some of the new restrictions will not be given legal force until Wednesday morning and there is likely to be a vote in Parliament, which is being recalled specially on the same day.\n\nMinisters had been celebrating the deployment of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not only cheaper than the one from Pfizer-BioNTech but also much easier to store. They said it could help turn the tide in Britain's battle against the virus.\n\nBut Britain is involved in a high-stakes race to roll out its mass vaccination program before its overstretched health service is overwhelmed by the new variant. Already, non-Covid treatment is being postponed, again, and images of ambulances stacking up in the parking lots of some hospitals last week illustrated the challenge faced by the country's weary health workers.
THE BOAT PEOPLE\n\nBy Sharon Bala\n\n352 pp. Doubleday. $26.95.\n\nTwo pieces of Canadian history lie behind Sharon Bala's debut novel, The Boat People. The first involves the arrival — in August 2010 — of the merchant vessel Sun Sea at Equimalt naval base in British Columbia, carrying hundreds of Sri Lankan asylum seekers. The second involves the internment of almost 24,000 Canadian citizens of Japanese origin in the Slocan Valley by the British Columbia Security Commission between 1941 and 1949.\n\n\n\nThe arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower Mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, Sellian, and Priya Rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. Grace Nakamura, an adjudicator for the Immigration and Refugee Board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, Kumi. The latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a Greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. It's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: Bala vilifies the Canadian Border Services Agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, Stephen Harper, and sings the praises of the Canadian Tamil Congress, which appears here as the Tamil Alliance.\n\nImage\n\nThe compassionate lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. The novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. Bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the small of things, hands, wounded children — all designed to elicit sympathy. Stock characters crowd the narrative. One of them, Grace's world-weary colleague Mitchell Hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. Bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (there can be a gap between policy and practice) to Border Services (the agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country's official boundaries).
LOS ANGELES — As California's deadliest wildfire was consuming the town of Paradise in November, some of the state's top power company officials and a dozen legislators were at an annual retreat at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort on Maui. In the course of four days, they discussed wildfires — and how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the devastation, if any.\n\nIt is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by California's investor-owned utilities. The largest, Pacific Gas and Electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. The most devastating of those, the Camp Fire, destroyed thousands of homes in Paradise and killed at least 86 people.\n\nRealizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. Their goal: a California law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates. After an earlier lobbying push, legislators have already voted to protect the companies from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires, and utilities are seeking the same for 2018.\n\nThe utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. In addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to California's energy sector.
While Mr. Warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first Democrat to be elected to the Senate from Georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved Ossoff-Perdue race and its implications for the next two years in American politics. Whichever party wins that race will control the Senate, with Republicans counting on Mr. Perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain Mr. Biden's policy ambitions.\n\nMs. Loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line Trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. In recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with Mr. Trump in northwest Georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to Mr. Biden when Congress meets on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.\n\nMr. Trump's refusal to acknowledge his defeat also robbed Ms. Loeffler of what might have been her best argument in what is still a slightly right-leaning state — that she would be a check on the liberal excesses in a government fully controlled by Democrats.\n\nEven before polls closed on Tuesday, senior Republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of Mr. Trump's denial.
In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.\n\nMr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast.\n\nThe Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty.\n\nLike other Chinese provincial leaders, Mr. Luo has had some dealings with Hong Kong, especially over investment and business. He held talks with his predecessor, Mr. Wang, at least once, leading a delegation from Shanxi Province to Hong Kong in late 2018. On that visit, Mr. Luo also met the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, to discuss investment opportunities. But he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017.\n\nWhen Mr. Luo stepped down as party chief in Shanxi, in November, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province's political ecology and overhaul its economy, two tasks that Mr. Xi may also want him to take on in Hong Kong. Mr. Luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of Mr. Xi and other central leaders.\n\nMr. Wang and Mr. Luo are among the roughly 200 members of the Chinese Communist Party's elite Central Committee, which gathers roughly once a year to discuss policy and review the performance of China's political leadership.
Kyle Glanville should have been thrilled. All 70 of the outdoor seats at Go Get Em Tiger were taken, only three days after he and his partner opened the cafe in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nHe was not. Everybody was at a laptop wearing headphones, Mr. Glanville said. He strode inside, unplugged the device that provided free Wi-Fi and tossed it into a bin in his office.\n\nHe wanted a courtyard where people talked to one another, not a silent office for remote workers. And while anyone with a cellphone hot spot could connect without his help, he had made himself clear. On a recent weekday morning, almost a year and a half later, the courtyard was still full of people, but this time they were talking to one another. Only one was at his laptop.\n\nRemote workers have staked out coffee shops for years, but small-business owners say their ranks are rising. In 2016, 43 percent of American employees spent some time working remotely, according to a Gallup survey; the number who telecommute at least half the time has grown by 115 percent since 2005, said a report last year from FlexJobs and Global Workplace Analytics. Add in the self-employed, and the crowd gets even bigger. And while some still embrace the home-and-pajama model, a large contingent hits the corner cafe.
Chris Hughes was raised by Lutheran parents in Hickory, N.C., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. Every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and Mr. Hughes carried that tradition into adulthood. But in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his Facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.\n\nI grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda, he told me in early February, explaining why he wanted to get the most value out of philanthropy. We were sitting in the East Village office of the Economic Security Project, an organization Mr. Hughes co-founded with two other activists, Dorian Warren and Natalie Foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nMr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. The social network's colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes's career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.\n\nIn his new book, Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn, out this week, Mr. Hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and Facebook's success — technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms — have created a winner takes all economy in which only a small group of people succeed.
Want this email in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.\n\nTensions, and oil prices, rise after U.S. move against Iran\n\nAmerica's killing of Iran's top security and intelligence commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, this morning has sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Tehran. And markets are taking notice.\n\nU.S. officials said General Suleimani had been hit in a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport. He was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades, the NYT notes. (Here's a smart long read on his importance.)\n\nCritics of the killing worry that it will cause huge trouble for the U.S. and allies like Israel, including putting America closer to war with Iran. Managing the trouble this strike seems likely to produce will further weaken the United States and entangle it in peripheral conflicts disconnected from U.S. security, said Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank in Washington.\n\nHow the markets are looking:\n\n• Oil prices were up 4 percent after news of the strike emerged, with Brent crude reaching nearly $70 a barrel.
A lawyer advising President Trump in recent weeks has resigned from her law firm after it was revealed that she participated in the call where Mr. Trump pressured Georgia officials to help him reverse the state's election results, the firm said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawyer, Cleta Mitchell, has been advising Mr. Trump despite a policy at her firm, Foley & Lardner, that none of its lawyers should represent clients involved in relitigating the presidential election.\n\nCleta Mitchell has informed firm management of her decision to resign from Foley & Lardner effective immediately, the firm said in its statement. Ms. Mitchell concluded that her departure was in the firm's best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests. We thank her for her contributions to the firm and wish her well.\n\nMs. Mitchell's resignation was the latest evidence of the problems Mr. Trump has created for law firms throughout his time in office, as their employees and clients object to ties with the president.
Some progressive groups have protested Ms. Raimondo's selection, arguing that the Biden administration should look to a populist Democrat instead. In a Jan. 6 announcement, the Revolving Door Project and Demand Progress criticized Ms. Raimondo as a corporate insider who locked in liability protection for businesses but stripped funding from low-income areas of Rhode Island during the pandemic.\n\nA progressive Democrat could wield the powers of the Commerce Department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.\n\nSome critics have asked whether Ms. Raimondo has the technical background to devise and carry out a strategy to deal with technology challenges from China. In addition to denouncing deindustrialization and promoting business in Rhode Island, she does have firsthand experience with China's economic challenges: Her father was laid off when the watch factory where he worked in Providence, R.I., moved to China.\n\nHistorically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. But given the growing importance of the U.S. competition with China, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.\n\nMichael Smart, a managing director and trade expert at Rock Creek Global Advisors, said a large part of the Biden administration's affirmative agenda in response to China, which includes efforts to make the American economy more competitive, would fall within the Commerce Department's jurisdiction.\n\nWilliam Reinsch, the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Biden and his team had placed a lot of emphasis on competing more effectively with China, including efforts to augment American industry that could be run through the Commerce Department.\n\nWhen you're in a race, there's only two ways to win. One is to trip the other guy, and the other is to run faster, Mr. Reinsch said. And to Biden's credit, he's really focused on running faster.
Trump's problem is that, until Thursday, that's what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.\n\nThe result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride.\n\nOne possible outcome is that a spooked Iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. Suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the Islamic Republic's thinking, says the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad. For 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. It may now take its time to reassess that view.\n\nThe alternative? Iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like Hezbollah for political deniability. It could try to take hostages at the American Embassy in Baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could use its influence in Iraq to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what Suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies observes. And it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing Trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.\n\nThe next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran's malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it's carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.\n\nThe clearer we are in limning the courses of hope and fear, the likelier we are to achieve a stable balance between them.
One of the biggest firms in the rent-to-own home business is now on the federal government's do-not-sell list.\n\nFannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance giant, said on Tuesday that it had stopped selling properties to the firm, Vision Property Management, after conducting a review of the firm's rent-to-own program, which operates in more than a dozen states.\n\nThe mortgage finance company will also impose restrictions on future sales of foreclosed homes to firms that engage in abusive forms of seller financing — which includes selling homes on either rent-to-own leases or in long-term installment agreements known as contract for deed.\n\nThe policy change by Fannie could put a big crimp in the business model of certain investment firms that have sprouted up since the financial crisis. These firms buy foreclosed homes on the cheap and sell them to people unable to qualify for a conventional mortgage.
The targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone at Baghdad International Airport was an impressive display of American military prowess. And it liquidated a destabilizing figure: The general was the commander of the Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. In the scheme of things, he had it coming. Yet killing him made little strategic sense for the United States. In some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of American foreign policymaking.\n\nPresident Trump ordered the strike directly, prompted by the death of an American contractor on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Iraqi Shia militia. Mr. Trump did not bother to consult congressional leaders. As with his other displays of martial fiat, his immediate impulse was probably to shock the liberal domestic audience, vicariously make himself feel tough, and assert raw executive power by going around the normal channels of decision making.\n\nPresidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had considered taking out General Suleimani but rejected it — not for lack of nerve, but for fear of undue escalation and an unnecessary war with Iran. The fundamental facts on the ground have not changed, and in the kind of robust interagency, national security decision-making process that the National Security Council staff is supposed to supervise, such concerns would have been systematically raised, dissected and discussed, and a consensus reached to inform presidential action. No such process seems to have occurred here.\n\nThe Pentagon has claimed, facilely, that General Suleimani was hit because the Revolutionary Guard was planning attacks on American targets in the region. But in a proper interagency review, the intelligence community could have pointed out that decapitation is a patently unreliable means of pre-emption — particularly when the organization in question is the Revolutionary Guard, an integral part of a well-honed security state with considerable depth of command talent.
In December, President Trump made an extraordinary declaration about U.S. involvement in Syria: We have won against ISIS. Now, it's time for our troops to come back home. Ignoring advice from his generals and advisers, Trump said that the U.S. would leave Syria. Defense Department officials said that they were ordered to do it within 30 days. [explosion] Then came a flurry of criticism, even from inside his own party. I believe it is a catastrophic mistake. This is very disappointing. It needs to be reconsidered. Then, the resignations. First, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis quit. And America's chief diplomat in the fight against ISIS, Brett McGurk, soon followed. Now, the timeline for a full withdrawal is unclear. I never said we're doing it that quickly. He went on to say that the U.S. will leave at a proper pace while continuing to fight ISIS, a shift from — They're all coming back, and they're coming back now. The nearly eight-year-long war in Syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. [explosion] So, how did we get here and what are U.S. forces doing in Syria? In 2011, uprisings rippled through the Middle East. Leaders fell in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. And after months of anti-government protests in Syria, the U.S. had a message for President Bashar al-Assad: This morning, President Obama called on Assad to step aside. He didn't and the conflict escalated. In 2012, Obama warned Assad against using Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons against his own people. That's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. A year later, Assad's army launched a chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] In response, the U.S. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. But a new threat was also emerging — ISIS. In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated. They warn that an American departure will weaken U.S. influence in the region and may embolden Russia, Iran and Turkey, who are also on the ground. The other worry? The move may inspire some ISIS fighters to return to Syria.

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nFacebook and Twitter temporarily locked President Trump's accounts this week after he inspired the rampage on the Capitol, and they are considering permanent bans.\n\nIt's worth asking whether the major internet properties should revise their rules for him and other people with large online followings who regularly spread bogus or harmful information.\n\nThere are a small number of influential people, including the president, who have repeatedly been instrumental in stoking misinformation about the election or spreading unproven treatments for the coronavirus.\n\nIf the internet companies want to give everyone a voice and create healthier online spaces, perhaps Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should subject the prominent band of habitual online misleaders to stricter rules. This could dial back some of the internet's dangers by penalizing those who do the most harm without stifling a vast majority's free expression.
WASHINGTON — This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times.\n\nA year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students.\n\nIn a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point's enrollment.\n\nAccording to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.\n\nThe department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
Boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a legal settlement with the Justice Department stemming from the 737 Max debacle, the government said on Thursday. The agreement resolves a criminal charge that Boeing conspired to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the company and evaluates its planes. With less than two weeks left in the Trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a Biden Justice Department would view a settlement off the table. President Trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of Boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company.\n\nElon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, is now the richest person in the world. An increase in Tesla's share price on Thursday pushed Mr. Musk past Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people. Mr. Musk's net worth was $195 billion by the end of trading on Thursday, $10 billion more than that of Mr. Bezos's. Mr. Musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion over the past 12 months, thanks to a rally in Tesla's share price, which surged 743 percent in 2020. The carmaker's shares rose nearly 8 percent on Thursday.\n\nWayfair, the furniture and home goods e-commerce business, said on Thursday that all of its U.S. employees would be paid at least $15 an hour. The increase, which took effect on Sunday, applies to full-time, part-time and seasonal employees. More than 40 percent of Wayfair's hourly workers across its U.S. supply chain and customer service operations received a pay bump.
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has abruptly sent the aircraft carrier Nimitz home from the Middle East and Africa over the objections of top military advisers, marking a reversal of a weekslong muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring Iran from attacking American troops and diplomats in the Persian Gulf.\n\nOfficials said on Friday that the acting defense secretary, Christopher C. Miller, had ordered the redeployment of the ship in part as a de-escalatory signal to Tehran to avoid stumbling into a crisis in President Trump's waning days in office. American intelligence reports indicate that Iran and its proxies may be preparing a strike as early as this weekend to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nSenior Pentagon officials said that Mr. Miller assessed that dispatching the Nimitz now, before the first anniversary this Sunday of General Suleimani's death in an American drone strike in Iraq, could remove what Iranian hard-liners see as a provocation that justifies their threats against American military targets. Some analysts said the return of the Nimitz to its home port of Bremerton, Wash., was a welcome reduction in tensions between the two countries.\n\nIf the Nimitz is departing, that could be because the Pentagon believes that the threat could subside somewhat, said Michael P. Mulroy, the Pentagon's former top Middle East policy official.
However, reconciliation bills must follow a set of complicated requirements known as the Byrd Rule. The simplest way of thinking about them is that legislative provisions have to be budgetary to be allowed. That means that the process isn't ideal for writing large-scale health reform, experts say, but it may be the best tool Democrats have to pass laws with their slim majority.\n\nThe Democrats have to deal with Robert Byrd and his nattering little rule that hasn't gone away, said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at McDermott+Consulting and a former health aide to Senator Chuck Grassley who worked on reconciliation bills during his Senate tenure.\n\nLegislators have often turned to reconciliation to pass health policy when their majority is slim. Democrats used it in 2010 to pass final tweaks to the Affordable Care Act after losing their supermajority. Republicans used it in a failed effort to repeal the health law in 2017 and in a successful attempt later the same year to make changes to the tax code.\n\nThere are six areas of health policy where congressional aides and health policy experts could see Democrats focusing their efforts this year. Smaller policy reforms are expected to be easier, both legally and politically, while more ambitious policies may not easily slot into reconciliation's strict rules — or the political preferences of enough Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAffordable Care Act expansions\n\nCongress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the Affordable Care Act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. One priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help. Another is rewriting formulas to peg the size of the subsidy to a more generous health insurance plan, a way to increase the amount of assistance.
On Monday, Mathilde Krim died. She was a biologist who spoke five languages; who contributed, in her 20s and 30s, to more than a dozen papers on cancer and virology; ran the interferon lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering; served on a team that developed a method for determining sex in utero; smuggled guns to opponents of British rule in Palestine; threw John F. Kennedy's 45th-birthday party at her East Side townhouse; married twice, had a daughter and later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her historic work in AIDS research and advocacy. At the news of her death, the internet paid relatively little attention.\n\nInstead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with Aziz Ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. The woman, who used the alias Grace, recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at Mr. Ansari's downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and Uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, Babe. We are meant to infer that the comedian's self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there's no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of Syrah.\n\nGrace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. Mr. Ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. He continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life.
Members of Congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward, Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. Our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient War Powers Act notification and by the administration's briefing today.\n\nThe day after Iranian missile struck bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, Republicans and Democrats in Congress split sharply over the president's approach on Iran and the way forward. Amid back-to-back classified briefings by top administration officials for members of the House and Senate, most Republicans praised Mr. Trump effusively on Wednesday for targeting General Suleimani and for his restraint in responding to Iran's action.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the president had shown patience and prudence.\n\nAs a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing, if need be, he said. I believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life. But he's rightly prepared to protect American lives and interests.\n\nBut a couple of Republicans joined Democrats in raising grave questions about Mr. Trump's strategy, concerns that only sharpened after the briefings on Capitol Hill by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel.
I don't really remember when I pulled the black Everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. Was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? Or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? Or the fall, when I began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while I was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?\n\nRecalling the pants' entrance into pandemic life is difficult because this particular pair of pants — priced at $98, made of an Italian wool trademarked as GoWeave — is supposed to transcend any one season. What this means is that it is not right for any season. They are too hot in summer, too flimsy in the winter, easily soaked by spring showers and … well, they are OK in the fall.\n\nThe fabric feels cheap, though. I hate the fabric. I hate the fit. They squeeze my thighs when I pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. They are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. And yet, beginning in September, I have been wearing them at least three times a week.\n\nThis is, as I have been telling anyone who will listen, a hate-wear. I am now hate-wearing clothing.
How Mr. Trump sees the killing of General Suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on Iran is unclear, and on Friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the United States and Iran do not spiral out of control. General Suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war, Mr. Trump said. The president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. But his policy toward Iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nWhen Iranian operatives blew holes in oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June and launched drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities in September, Mr. Trump opted in both cases against a direct, immediate military response. Still, one day after the drone strike targeting General Suleimani, the Pentagon announced it was sending around 3,000 more troops to Kuwait as a precaution against growing threats to American forces in the region.\n\nLindsay P. Cohn, a professor of political science at the Naval War College, said that Mr. Trump appears to be convinced that General Suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the Middle East. It satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.\n\nHe doesn't want to get entangled. But he doesn't want to look weak, said Professor Cohn, adding that her opinions did not necessarily represent those of the Defense Department.\n\nThe president's mercurial approach to Iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including European NATO allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Arab nations in the Persian Gulf region uncertain about Mr. Trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from Iran.
The phrase Jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides American foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in Mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, American foreign policy tends to work.\n\nThe Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the United States military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.\n\nBut far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (No blood for oil is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.\n\nBut when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.\n\nYes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that's what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.\n\nWe would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.\n\nAnd prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It's easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. By the paper's calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.\n\nThe actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.\n\nPeople are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.\n\nThere are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building.\n\nSo let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.
You follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice, Ms. Doggart posted on the Facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.'Oh no. Wait. We were mistaken. It's actually the opposite thing you should be doing!'\n\nBut others reacted with sadness, wondering whether better information earlier on might have prevented their children's allergies. It is a bit disheartening and frustrating, Heather Eslinger, a physical therapist in Colorado Springs whose children have nut allergies, said in an interview. It is hard to accept that things may have been different had we known then what we know now.\n\nWhile national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. For starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. As a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.\n\nI gave my 5-month-old a bit of my toast and peanut butter and we ended up in the emergency room, said Lori Dombek, 58, a web developer in Gorham, Me., whose son is now 22. Peanut allergies are nothing to fool with.\n\nBut scientists say the new guidelines are based on the latest science. A large clinical trial studied hundreds of British children at risk for peanut allergies, giving them either peanut-containing food regularly from infancy or withholding all foods with peanuts.\n\nBy the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.\n\nThe trial's results were very very unambiguous, said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, chairman of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's food allergy committee and one of the authors of the new guidelines. The fact that the guidelines changed over time makes them more credible, not less, he said.
Battered by a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, local jails and state prison systems around the United States have resorted to a drastic strategy to keep the virus at bay: Shutting down completely and transferring their inmates elsewhere.\n\nFrom California to Missouri to Pennsylvania, state and local officials say that so many guards have fallen ill with the virus and are unable to work that abruptly closing some correctional facilities is the only way to maintain community security and prisoner safety.\n\nExperts say the fallout is easy to predict: The jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease-ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls.\n\nMovement of people is dangerous, said Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who has been tracking coronavirus cases in correctional settings. We've got really good examples of overcrowding equals more infection and greater risk of outbreak. We've got lots of evidence that even transferring people from one facility to the next is very dangerous.
Lightning killed fewer Americans last year than any year on record, marking a steady downward trend that experts attribute to more awareness, better lightning-proof construction and fewer people working in farms and fields.\n\nLightning killed 16 people in 2017, the fewest deaths since accurate records began in 1940, the National Weather Service said. This broke the previous record low of 23, set in 2013, weather service meteorologist John Jensenius said.\n\nThe number of people killed by lightning in recent years a far cry from annual lightning deaths decades ago: In the 1940s, for instance, hundreds of people were killed each year by lightning. In 1943 alone, 432 people died.\n\nIn 2001, the weather service launched a lightning safety campaign, which included the now well-known phrase when thunder roars, go indoors. At that time, the nation recorded about 55 lightning deaths a year.\n\nOver the past decade, an average of 27 Americans were killed each year from lightning strikes, Jensenius said. While we don't like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging, Jensenius added.\n\nJensenius said increased awareness prompted better lightning safety policy for outdoor sports and recreational organizations.\n\nAnd when lightning does strike, Jensenius said, better medical treatment and access to automatic external defibrillators has helped save the lives of lightning strike victims. Roughly 90% of people struck by lightning survive.\n\nThe highest number of lightning deaths occurred in Florida, which recorded five fatalities. Alabama followed with three and Colorado, Texas and North Carolina had two each. The other two lightning deaths occurred in Ohio and Puerto Rico. All but one of the victims were male. On average, 79% of lightning victims are male, based on data from 2006 to 2016.\n\nThe sharp drop in lightning deaths over the past 75 years  coincides with a shift in population from rural to urban regions, wrote meteorologist Ronald Holle in an article in the Journal of Applied Meteorology.\n\nIn the 1940s, there were many, many more small farmers who were out working in fields, which meant many more chances to be struck by lightning, Jensenius said.\n\nIn addition to better lightning safety awareness and medical advances, all phones were corded decades ago, leading to quite a few deaths due to people speaking on the phone. Additionally, there has been better lightning protection, suppression and grounding in electrical and phone lines, he said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the blame for the escalating hostilities between the U.S. and Iran on former President Barack Obama, accusing the previous administration of trying to appease the theocratic regime and arguing that the deal aimed at delaying Iran's development of nuclear weapons only succeeded in funding regional terrorism.\n\nWe're trying to correct for what was the Obama administration's appeasement of Iran, Pompeo said Sunday on the ABC News' This Week.\n\nThis is a regime that has been acting against America for an awfully long time. And we are suffering from eight years of neglect and we're trying to push it back. We're trying to contain them, he said.\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate for a U.S. airstrike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the well-known leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, near the Baghdad airport last week.\n\n'I want to have peace':How Trump went from a vow to avoid conflict to an order to kill Iran general\n\nThe attack that killed Soleimani came after Iran-backed militias stormed the U.S. Embassy in response to an earlier U.S. airstrike that killed at least two dozen militia fighters in sites in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said that strike was in retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq that killed an American contractor and left four U.S. service members wounded.\n\nSpeaking on CNN's State of the Union, Pompeo said the administration is prepared for anything the Islamic Republic of Iran may do in response to Soleimani's death.\n\nHe referred to the developing conflict as a war, which he said began when Obama and the European Union adopted the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under that deal, Iran agreed to scrap its nuclear weapons program for at least 10 years in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of previously frozen funds.\n\nFrankly, this war kicked off – people talk about the war – this war kicked off when the JCPOA was entered into, he said.\n\nPompeo said that under the terrible nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of, hundred of thousands of people died in Syria and Shiite militias grew more powerful.\n\nThese are things that were ongoing activities, resourced and funded by the trade and the money that was provided under the JCPOA, he said on This Week.\n\nThat was the deal we inherited. It's a place we found ourselves, and we're working diligently to execute our strategy to convince the Iranian regime to act like a normal nation, he said.\n\nCritics of Trump's Iran policy dispute Pompeo's take on who is to blame for the current state of affairs, arguing Trump set the U.S. on the path to conflict with Iran by pulling out of the nuclear agreement.\n\nFormer Obama adviser Ben Rhodes said Iran had been complying with the nuclear deal and that Iran did not launch any rocket attacks on U.S. interests after the deal took effect.\n\nTrump pulled out and Iran resumed nuke program and rocket attacks, Rhodes tweeted.\n\nPompeo said the U.S. strategy to contain Iran included a diplomatic, economic and military components, as well as an enormous coalition of regional allies.\n\nDespite the secretary of state's belief that Trump's Iran strategy is absolutely working and that the world is a safer place with the killing of Soleimani, critics said the actions further destabilized the region and risk an all-out war with Iran.\n\nI really worry that the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East. He promised we wouldn't have that. And I think we're closer to that now because of his actions, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on This Week.\n\nMore:Iraq votes to expel U.S. troops after Iran Gen. Qasem Soleimani's killing\n\nSchumer did not think Soleimani's death made the world safer and he questioned whether Trump was prepared for the Iranian response.\n\nAnd let's face it, this president has made a mess of foreign policy. North Korea, they're much stronger than they were when he started. In Syria, he messed up. Every encounter he has with Putin, he loses, Schumer said. And so, I am really worried, and that is why Congress must assert itself.\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate have introduced a resolution barring the administration from taking military action against Iran without further congressional authorization.\n\n‪Let's not mince words: the assassination of Qasem Soleimani was an act of war undertaken without Congressional authorization, in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America, wrote Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Barbara Lee, D-Calif., in a statement announcing the House resolution.\n\nPompeo said the administration had all the authority we need to do what we've done to-date and promised it will continue to do things appropriately, lawfully, and constitutionally.\n\nBut Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday on CBS News' Face the Nation that Trump does not have authorization from Congress to go to war with Iran and the killing of Soleimani – which he called an assassination – potentially sets us on a course to do just that.\n\nMurphy said the Trump administration's Iran policy has been a disaster from the very beginning, arguing Iran was more powerful now than when Trump took office. He said Obama and former President George W. Bush also had the opportunity to kill Soleimani but did not act on it despite the fact that he was carrying out attacks on U.S. forces, because they believed ultimately that would get more Americans killed.\n\nThe Democratic senator said the negative consequences of Soleimani's death were already being felt as Iraq's prime minister and Parliament have called for U.S. troops to leave the country after nearly two decades.\n\nHe also accused Trump of violating the War Powers Act by not consulting with congressional leaders before the strike. The administration has justified the attack on Soleimani on the grounds that he was plotting future attacks on U.S. troops and interests. But Murphy said the burden of proof is on the administration to show lawmakers that the Iranian general represented an imminent threat.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was one of the Democratic lawmakers to be briefed after the attack.\n\nI accept the notion that there was a real threat, Warner said on NBC's Meet the Press. The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., agreed it was accurate to say Soleimani was plotting against American interests.\n\nBut it's also true that Soleimani has been plotting against the United States for decades. The question is, did the plotting here rise to the level that required his elimination from the battlefield? Schiff said. I don't think the intelligence supports the conclusion that removing Soleimani increases our security.\n\nSchumer called the information he had seen from the administration very unsatisfying.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on both the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, said Trump's actions had been defensive.\n\nHe is not saying Congress, I need 100,000 American troops to invade Iran. That's why all this talk about war powers and congressional authority is so silly, Rubio said. The president's not talking about invading Iran. He's talking about responding to anything Iran may do in the future. And the president has not only the full authority to do that, but an obligation to do that.\n\nRubio said Trump was forced to act in the face of information that there is an imminent and credible threat that could cost the lives of potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of American servicemen and women and other personnel in the region.\n\nAny president would have an obligation to act. And this president did, Rubio said.
USA TODAY\n\nThe partial government shutdown entered its 12th day on Wednesday, as congressional leaders planned to meet with President Donald Trump.\n\n'Hoping for the best, planning for the worst'\n\nBy Ernest Johnson\n\nEveryone affected by the shutdown is a real person, including myself. I have bills, just like everyone. And while I'm just a single guy, others are single parents, have families, are caring for elderly parents, among others. The shutdown has created 800,000 permutations of this example. Just like many Americans, I'm struggling to make ends meet.\n\nNot knowing how long the shutdown would last — and anticipating it might last more than two weeks, and that if we get back pay, it might not be for a couple weeks, as well — I chatted with Ally Auto Finance and asked whether my account was in good enough standing to request a deferment due to the furlough and not having income. Ally allowed it, but a deferment is a pay the interest in January and February is the difference of a full payment, so I'm still paying $160 this month, but next month it'll be about $360.\n\nTalker:Is Warren the candidate Democrats have been waiting for? Some doubt it\n\nThose of us affected by the shutdown are your friends and neighbors, our children go to the same schools, we attend the same religious centers, and we are all focused on providing for our families and the communities in which we live. We do not go to work waving flags with Go Team Red or Go Team Blue. My co-workers and team members have common goals of providing the most efficient, quality service to the public who depend on our services.\n\nI'm still waiting on unemployment insurance to be approved, then I can know how much I'll need to borrow from friends come Feb. 1 for rent and bills due early that month.\n\nWhen you see our #ShutdownStories, please understand that we are regular people. We are nervous, stressed, afraid, worried and concerned about all this, and we are simply expressing our feelings. Personally, I would be fine working with no pay (knowing I will get back pay), just so I can keep my services, responsibilities and commitments to the public. I do not know how all of this will end, all I know is that I will just put one foot in front of the other and make it through another day. Hoping for the best, planning for the worst.\n\nErnest Johnson is a federal employee in Wyoming. You can follow him on Twitter: @SciFiCowboy_v2.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nThe New York Times, editorial: For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room.\n\nJonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority.\n\nThe Washington Post, editorial: In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation's immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nWhy is border security any more critical now than it was two years ago when Donald Trump became president? Has Trump made it worse over the past two years? Republicans had two years to get Trump his wall and they didn't.\n\n— John Bertelson\n\nSenate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have no incentive to end the shutdown. As long as they think the shutdown will hurt Trump politically, they could not care less how much the shutdown hurts the country and its people.\n\n— Robert Johnson\n\nIn two years, Trump couldn't get a dime out of a Republican majority Congress for his silly wall. So now he tells his true supporters it can magically happen by constitutionally mugging the nation?\n\n— Dannie Leroy Porath\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
WASHINGTON – While the nation was watching how Attorney General nominee William Barr would answer questions on his record and views on policies, an 8-year-old boy in the audience seemed to steal the spotlight.\n\nBarr's grandson, Liam, caught the attention of lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats alike, who offered him snacks, a chance to sit with them and even a bit of career advice.\n\nBefore the hearing began Tuesday morning, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., sat down with the 8-year-old, who donned a green tie and dress shoes, in the chairs of lawmakers and chatted about making snowballs in snow-covered Washington and flying on Air Force One.\n\nI had a great conversation with Liam this morning, Kennedy wrote on Twitter. I'm looking forward to getting to know his grandfather, William Barr, during the Attorney General hearing today.\n\nAs William Barr walked into the hearing room to start hours of questioning, he stopped in front of Liam and jokingly tried to take his nose. He started off his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee by introducing his family. His three daughters are attorneys and both of Liam's parents work as lawyers for the Justice Department.\n\nBarr, while listing the list of attorneys in his family, introduced Liam as a future Justice Department employee to a crowded room of laughter.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and chair of the committee, interrupted Barr, telling the 8-year-old boy, Think about medical school, Liam. Somebody needs to make money in the family.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gave a little different career advice to Liam, given how many of his relatives had worked in the Justice Department.\n\nHe ought to consider, at least for some balance, being a public defender, Durbin said.\n\nLawmakers continued to poke fun at Liam's future throughout the hearing and commended him for sitting patiently through hours of questions about Barr's thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller, Russia, counter-intelligence investigations, torture, gun policies and President Donald Trump.\n\nHis feet dangling in the air, unable to reach the ground, Liam sat in the front row of the audience and used a pen and notepad to get through the all-day affair.\n\nHe wrote a sweet letter to his grandpa, telling him, I love you so much. You are doing great so far. Liam wrote that he was having so much fun.\n\nLiam ended the letter to his grandpa with a misspelled last thought on how things had been going thus far: P.S. I think Rusha's people are fine. It is the government is the problam.\n\nAfter six hours on the Hill, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., paused before resuming questioning to say she was sending a care package from the dais that included a bag of chips, a Snickers candy bar and a granola bar to Barr's grandson for making it so far into the hearing.\n\nHe deserves a medal, Feinstein said.\n\nThose online joked that Liam had become the star of the hearing and more attention was being paid to the 8-year-old boy than to Barr's policy decisions in the past.
Mark Mellman\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nEnforce the norms is not exactly a captivating bumper sticker, but it is a compelling rationale for removing President Donald Trump from office, immediately.\n\nWe are a nation of laws. We are also a nation of norms, and those norms undergird our democracy. Without them, our laws and institutions would be insufficient to protect the republic our Founders bequeathed us.\n\nSince 1950, there have been well over 200 successful coups worldwide, not because those countries had weak anti-coup laws, but rather because they suffered weak democratic norms.\n\nIt is not against the law for a president to knowingly and repeatedly lie to the country, even though regular and extensive dishonesty from a president makes a mockery of democratic decision making.\n\nUntil President Donald Trump spent his term making 30,000 false and misleading statements, strong norms dictated honesty. Recall the Republican obsession with Ambassador Susan Rice correctly quoting an incorrect early intelligence community assessment of the events at Benghazi. As far as the GOP was concerned unknowingly repeating an inaccurate statement supplied by executive branch agencies, was sufficiently egregious to render her unfit for membership in the president's cabinet.\n\nNorms are as important as laws\n\nPresident Trump rightly claimed that the law governing conflicts of interest specifically exempted him. The importance of the norm against presidents using their official positions to enrich themselves was articulated by no less than President Trump's favorite Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, who, as a Justice Department official, wrote that it would obviously be undesirable as a matter of policy for the president or vice president to engage in conduct proscribed by conflict of interest rules, whether or not they technically apply.\n\nNo law, strong norm.\n\nWhile federal law does proscribe candidates from receiving anything of value from a foreign national, no law prohibits a president from asking foreign powers with whom the United States is in conflict to intervene on his behalf in U.S. elections.\n\nBefore President Trump begged Russia and China, as well as Ukraine, for electoral help, the norms against such behavior were so strong that no candidate would have dreamed of making such requests.\n\nLawyers continue to debate whether the president ordering a state election official to find 11,780 votes, the number he needed to change the result in Georgia, constitutes a crime, but the widespread condemnation of the conversation by Republicans makes clear it violated a strong norm. No law prevents a president from employing hate speech, though until Trump, presidents didn't.\n\nBut even strong norms erode if they are not enforced.\n\nSen. Jon Tester: Members of Congress who incited Capitol riot must be held accountable\n\nDuring impeachment, Republican senators hid behind irrelevant legalisms. Their argument that Trump's behavior was not criminal altered, perhaps permanently, the Founders' intent in defining high crimes and misdemeanors as grounds for removal from office.\n\nWhen the Senate exonerated Trump, they made it more likely that he and potentially, future presidents would ignore the norms that enable our democracy to function. And what was the result? More of the same, but worse. This time the president incited political violence, leading to homicide.\n\nTrump retains too much power to stay\n\nRepublicans claimed Trump would be chastened by impeachment, even absent a conviction. They were wrong. Instead Trump was emboldened, and every senator who voted to acquit bears some responsibility for the Trump's ensuing attack on democracy, culminating in last week's coup attempt.\n\nNow they're arguing it's too late to take action, and besides, this time, Trump really has learned his lesson.\n\nIt is not too late to enforce the norms. It is not too late to make a clear and unambiguous statement about the limits of presidential behavior. Failure to do so could damage democracy for decades to come.\n\nBipartisan path: Pence should threaten the 25th Amendment and Congress should impeach to purge Trump stain\n\nPresident Trump abused his office for personal gain, sowed hatred, lied to America, attempted to subvert the electoral process, and finally incited insurrection and violence. He deserves to be punished for each of those violations of the moral order, even if they are not violations of criminal statutes. But more important, we the people deserve the protection afforded by the norms that ensure our democracy — protection we can only secure by removing Trump, thereby enforcing those norms.\n\nIf instead we just wait out the next week until Joe Biden is inaugurated, what will Republicans say if Trump uses his last minutes in office, acting within his legal limits, to pardon the very insurrectionists arrested for attacking the capitol, further eroding democratic norms?\n\nThen, it will be far too late.\n\nMark Mellman, president of The Mellman Group and past president of the American Association of Political Consultants, has helped elect 30 senators, 12 governors and dozens of House members, and was pollster to Senate Democratic leaders for more than 20 years.

Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWe're looking at a quirky new year for financial aid applications for college. Parents and students face the prospect of filing two FAFSAs in 2016. Yes, two times the bury-your-head-in-paperwork fun in one year.\n\nIt's a one-time blip because of an upcoming change in the rules for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The new rules kick off for the 2017-18 school year when filling out FAFSA forms will start on Oct. 1, 2016.\n\nFor students heading to college in the 2016-17 school year, though, the timetable remains the same as in past years when the FAFSA filing season starts Jan. 1. So it's time to get moving on the first FAFSA round for the year.\n\nFiling the FAFSA is one of those headaches that's a necessary part of college life. And let's face it, when you mix the federal government with academics, well, let the jargon fly.\n\nBut filing the FAFSA is essential to receiving financial aid from the federal government, state government and most colleges and universities. It's a free form that covers one school year at a time.\n\nHow much aid you can receive, though, can vary considerably even within the same family each year.\n\nSmall changes in income, student assets and the number of children in college can have a big impact, said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert who is now publisher and vice president of strategy for Cappex.com.\n\nHere are five things to know about FAFSA:\n\nNo. 1: File as early as possible once the forms are available.\n\nYou can file the forms online now for 2016-17. Do not drag your feet and say, maybe, wait to file until you've actually completed your tax returns. Do not wait for an acceptance email or letter from a given college, either. See Fafsa.ed.gov.\n\nThe actual deadlines vary by state. If your legal residence is Michigan, for example, the deadline for the 2016-17 school year is March 1. A chart at the FAFSA site lists deadlines by state. Iowa, for example, lists July 1 by midnight central time. Earlier priority deadlines might exist in Iowa for certain programs.\n\nKaren McCarthy, senior policy analyst for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the biggest mistake that parents and students make is that they wait until the last minute possible fill out the FAFSA form, instead of filing as soon as possible.\n\nThey do not file early enough because they think they have lots of time to do it, McCarthy said.\n\nBut some financial aid is awarded, for example, on a first-come, first-served basis. Some schools have earlier deadlines.\n\nOne tip: Many states offer College Goal Sunday programs in January, February and March. Such sessions provide free help to complete the FAFSA form.\n\nSee collegegoalsundayusa.org. Or see MICollegeGoal.org for a list of events across Michigan, most of which run in February. Or you can call 800-832-2464 on weekdays for information on the Michigan programs.\n\nAnother good resource: U.S. Department of Education's toll free hotline is 800-433-3243.\n\nSome local high schools also hold financial aid nights or other events to help parents and students learn about FAFSA.\n\nNo. 2: Don't over-inflate your investments.\n\nWhen it comes to FAFSA forms, money in a retirement plan, including a 401(k) and IRA, is not counted as part of your assets or investments, Kantrowitz said. You also do not need to include the net equity in your primary home. You would count equity in a vacation home or rental property on the FAFSA form.\n\nIf you take a distribution from your 401(k) plan that year, of course, that money would be counted as income for the FAFSA form.\n\nMillennials get an extra boost to save for cars and homes\n\nKantrowitz said one of the big mistakes people make involves listing money in retirement plans among assets, thereby inflating your wealth and possibly reducing the student's chances for financial aid.\n\nIn general, it can help to gather your paperwork before trying to sit down and complete the form. You can file estimated figures in advance of actually filing your 2015 income tax return. So you'd need your final pay stub for 2015, W-2 forms and 1099s.\n\nIf you use estimated tax information to fill out a FAFSA, you must correct that information after you file your tax return. You can use the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool, which is available within the online FAFSA, to access IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA and transfer the data directly to FAFSA from the IRS.\n\nYou'd need records of other taxable income, including unemployment benefits, too.\n\nIf you've filed the 2015 tax return early or you wait to file the FAFSA form until you do, you'd gather that 1040 tax form too.\n\nThe FAFSA will require Social Security numbers. And for dependent students, the FAFSA will also require the parent's Social Security Number. A student's driver's license is optional -- and recommended -- to provide a way to verify the student's identity.\n\nNo. 3: Take time to read the instructions carefully.\n\nUnfortunately, it can be easy to plug in an answer online when you really don't know the answer. But this isn't like some standardized testing. You don't get extra points for guessing.\n\nCatherine Berrahou, director of financial aid and scholarships at Walsh College in Troy, said the online form for FAFSA does give helpful hints and tips, if you don't understand a question.\n\nWhat's a common error? One question involves what you paid in federal taxes, she said, but sometimes a parent or student will fill in the adjusted gross income. That's not correct, as income tax is not the same as income, according to a warningon a U.S. Department of Education blog.\n\nOr some could mistakenly leave blank the area to report a parent's income from work.\n\nBerrahou recommends that students go back within a day or two after filing the form to make sure the application was not rejected. If it is rejected, she said, take extra care and provide the necessary information soon.\n\nAnother common mistake? Take care to fill out the exact name that's listed on the student's Social Security card. If you're daughter's birth name is Jane and that's what's on Social Security records, don't fill out Jenny if that's what she calls herself now. Do not use nicknames.\n\nDid you just win a college scholarship? Or not? Marketing can be deceptive\n\nOther tips: Do not forget to sign the FAFSA forms. If you're a dependent student, you also need to report information relating to your parents.\n\nNo. 4: Divorced? Some families first must determine what parent to list on FAFSA.\n\nFamily life can add a different twist to the FAFSA mix.\n\nAnita Myles, senior vice president for Edvisors.com, said it's essential to review the rules in cases when parents are divorced or when there are other special family situations.\n\nFor example, if the student's grandparent legally adopts the student, the grandparent will be required to complete the FAFSA, according to the Filing the FAFSA book that's free online at www.edvisors.com.\n\nIf the student only lives with the grandparent -- and was not adopted by the grandparent -- the grandparent is not considered to be the parent when filing the FAFSA form. But at the same time, any financial aid provided by the grandparent to the student should be reported as untaxed income to the student on the FAFSA, Kantrowitz said.\n\nIn the case of a divorce, the dependent student would need to review which parent he or she has spent the most time with in the past year. If time was split evenly, Myles said, the parent for FAFSA would be the one who provided the most financial support.\n\nNo. 5: Be prepared come October to have all this fun again.\n\nA new start time for the FAFSA season hits for the 2017-18 school year when filling out FAFSA forms will start in October.\n\nThe strategy is twofold: High school seniors and others could apply for financial aid in the fall around the same time as they fill out applications for colleges. Plus you'd have the 2015 tax return to use when filing the FAFSA for the 2017-18 academic year.\n\nRick Castellano, a spokesperson for Sallie Mae, said the October kick off could take some of the mystery out of getting appropriate tax information so early in the year. The earlier kick off could encourage some families to take time to file the FAFSA.\n\nThe last thing you want to do is miss out on free money for college, Castellano said. You don't want to leave that free money on the table.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.
USA TODAY is keeping track of the news surrounding COVID-19 as a pair of vaccines join the U.S. fight against a virus that has killed 384,000 Americans since the first reported fatality in February.

Sign up for our Coronavirus Watch newsletter for updates directly to your inbox, join our Facebook group or scroll through our in-depth answers to reader questions for everything you need to know about the coronavirus.\n\nIn the headlines:\n\n►Coronavirus deaths in the U.S. have hit another one-day high at more than 4,300. The nation's overall death toll from coronavirus has eclipsed 383,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. It is closing in fast on the number of Americans killed in World War II, about 405,000. The U.S. recorded 4,327 deaths on Tuesday; Arizona and California are among the hardest-hit states.\n\n►California has lifted a stay-at-home order for 13 northern counties with improving hospital conditions, but most of the state's population remains under tight restrictions in the pandemic. The state on Tuesday lifted the order in the Sacramento region – a rare turn of good news as California pushes through what Gov. Gavin Newsom called its most intense surge of the coronavirus.\n\n►Scientists have identified a mutation that may decrease the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. The mutation, first spotted in South Africa two months ago, has since spread to 12 other countries.\n\n►South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said a task team under the African Union has secured 270 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the continent, the largest such deal for the region. Ramaphosa said the doses will come from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca.\n\n►Recent analysis of late-stage trials found China's COVID-19 candidate vaccine, CoronaVac, has an overall effectiveness of 50.38%, the Butantan Institute said Tuesday in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While the vaccine meets the threshold for regulatory approval, it's a disappointing descent from early results that showed it was 78% effective.\n\n►Los Angeles County is asking residents to wear masks at home if they go out for work or to get groceries, the Los Angeles Times reported, as the region nears 1 million virus cases. In addition, the L.A. City Council approved a motion Wednesday instructing city departments to prioritize issuing citations during normal duties to people not wearing masks.\n\n📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 23 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 384,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 92 million cases and 1.97 million deaths.\n\n📘 What we're reading: U.S. hospitals are on the brink – but COVID-19 isn't slowing down. Absolutely, it's what we feared, the chief health care officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges told USA TODAY. Read more here.\n\nAs virus rampages through Southern California, many health workers reject vaccine\n\nEven as the coronavirus is running rampant through large swaths of Southern California, a substantial number of health care workers -- who are first in line for the vaccine -- are rejecting the shots.\n\nAbout half the hospital workers offered the COVID vaccine in Riverside County, southeast of hard-hit Los Angeles County, have turned it down. With a population of 2.5 million, Riverside County on Tuesday became the eighth county in the nation to exceed 200,000 coronavirus cases.\n\nSome of them are saying, 'You know, not yet,' that they just want to see how things go, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari told the Palm Springs Desert Sun. Some are just not giving any type of reason on why they're not taking it.\n\nOperation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui resigns but will stay on through Biden transition\n\nMoncef Slaoui, who has helped lead the Trump administration's vaccine development effort, is resigning but has agreed to stay on in an advisory role for 30 days to support the transition to the Biden administration.\n\nSlaoui has long said that he would resign as head of Operation Warp Speed around the end of 2020 or early 2021 when he felt like he had contributed as much as he could to the vaccine development. The emphasis has now shifted to distribution and delivery, which is under the purview of General Gus Perna.\n\nLast week, Slaoui said he would stay longer than initially planned to ensure the success of three more large clinical trials underway, testing candidate vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Oxford University and Novavax.\n\n– Karen Weintraub\n\nWhat will COVID-19 look like in the future? Possibly another common cold, study says\n\nSARS-CoV-2 could join the ranks of mild, cold-causing … human coronaviruses in the long run, according to a model developed by Emory University and Penn State University scientists.\n\nThe model, published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science, compares the deadly virus to four common cold coronaviruses plus the SARS and MERS viruses, which surfaced in 2003 and 2012, respectively.\n\nResearchers determined from the model that if the coronavirus continues to circulate in the general population and most people are exposed to it from childhood, it could be added to the list of common colds.\n\nStudy authors concede the model makes some assumptions about the coronavirus and common colds that are not known yet, but a take-home message is the critical need for broad-scale vaccination may wane in the near term, said study author Ottar Bjornstad, who teaches entomology and biology at Penn State University.\n\nSome states speed up vaccine distribution while others push back on federal changes\n\nFacing a slower-than-hoped coronavirus vaccine rollout, officials around the nation shifted gears Tuesday to accelerate the elivery of shots to more people. The U.S. government is asking states to speed up COVID-19 vaccinations to people over 65 and others at risk instead of holding back vaccines for a second dose.\n\nThe change had immediate effects in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo expanded the vaccine eligibility requirements to follow the new CDC guidelines. Idaho will implement the guidelines Feb. 1, Gov. Brad Little said. Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also said they're immediately expanding vaccination guidelines to include patients 65 and older.\n\nHowever, other states are pushing back on federal guidance, citing supply concerns. Rhode Island Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken referenced those in saying the state does not plan to expand vaccinations to people 65 and older. Iowa's health department said the state may consider adopting new guidelines once we have reasonable confidence that supply meets the demands of this broader eligibility criteria.\n\nHospitals face COVID-19 surge, staff shortages and rising deaths\n\nFour states with the largest share of hospital beds occupied with COVID-19 patients – California, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia – are struggling to keep pace with the unprecedented surge.\n\nIn Los Angeles, public hospitals are preparing to shift to crisis mode, and the county has instructed ambulances to not send patients to overburdened hospitals if they can't be revived in the field. More than two dozen Georgia hospitals have no available beds in intensive care units, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhile public health officials are optimistic widespread vaccination will provide a glimmer of hope this spring, there's no respite now for doctors and nurses in overburdened emergency rooms and intensive care units.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
The venue was packed with more than a thousand people waiting to see Pete Buttigieg, and a chant had broken out for the Democratic presidential candidate a few minutes before he took the stage.\n\nKasey Peters, inside the hall, did not chant along. He did not hold up a sign for the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, like some around him, or outwardly applaud Buttigieg's remarks. The 31-year-old compliance analyst was there just to listen.\n\nThe Saturday event was only Peters' second time seeing a candidate in person this Iowa caucus cycle. He saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts nearly a year ago, when she first announced her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Peters had effectively tuned out the crowded race since then, and he's still undecided.\n\nThings will change in the weeks ahead, as Peters goes to other candidate events and reads up on policy proposals.\n\nNow that we're getting closer to caucus, I'm diving in, he said.\n\nWith a month to go before the Feb. 3 caucuses, Iowans like Peters appear to be everywhere. Multi-candidate events draw large turnouts from fervent supporters, but there are also those in the first-in-the-nation caucus state who are not sure which candidate to support. They're only now beginning to venture out to see the candidates in person, despite the inundation of political ads on television and nearly 2,000 public events candidates have hosted in Iowa in 2019.\n\nI am one of the undecided, declared Jenny Burton, a social worker who attended the West Des Moines Buttigieg event. Burton noted that she had met author Marianne Williamson in Des Moines a few days earlier. Burton is actively considering multiple candidates, including Williamson and Warren.\n\nI'm trying to get in with anybody who's coming to the community, Burton explained about her caucus strategy in the weeks ahead.\n\nBurton added about the candidates: I respect all of them, almost equally. That's why it's so difficult for me to narrow it down to one.\n\n'Undecideds' spark hope for low-polling candidates\n\nIn September, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, while 63% said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\n\nAn Iowa Poll released in November showed an uptick in decision-making: More respondents — then at 30% — said they had a first choice and their minds were made up. But 62% who said they had a first choice also said they could still be persuaded.\n\nThat indecision has been a lifeline for several presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, despite a shrinking debate stage that has limited some candidates' exposure.\n\nDave Waters of Boone saw Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey speak in Adel on Dec. 20. The senator, who failed to make it onto the debate stage in Los Angeles the day before, was on Waters' list of possible picks.\n\nWaters said he has usually decided which candidate to caucus for by now.\n\nThere's too many good ones, Waters said about his dilemma this time.\n\nSome likely caucusgoers are in no rush to figure things out.\n\nJim Oxendale, who saw Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at a Dec. 22 event in Ida Grove, said he won't make a final decision until the last 15 minutes before the caucuses.\n\nI think this is a very serious thing, said the 70-year-old Oxendale, who also lives in Ida Grove. And it makes me nervous to commit to somebody too early because we're a long way from February.\n\nAfter hearing former Vice President Joe Biden speak in Tipton on Saturday, West Liberty resident Faye Petersen said she is beginning to think that perhaps he's the one.\n\nEven so, Petersen added, she is still undecided — she also likes Klobuchar, Booker and entrepreneur Andrew Yang — and she fully expects to change her mind at least a few more times before she attends her caucus.\n\nI will make it up before then, she said, dismissing any pressure to choose.\n\nEvery darn one of them is way better than what we have, Petersen said.\n\nStill a lot of candidates to choose from\n\nPeters, who attended the Buttigieg event in West Des Moines, said he tuned out for most of last year because there were so many candidates in the race. That number has dropped only a little, from a high of more than two dozen to 15 candidates.\n\nPeters said while his interest in Warren has subsided, he likes Buttigieg. He is also intrigued by former Rep. John Delaney from Maryland.\n\nHe's someone I'd like to look a little more into, Peters said of Delaney. … He's kind of been someone I've paid attention to the whole time he's been in the race.\n\nPeters said he knows several friends who are undecided like him. He said some have expressed interest in Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Yang.\n\nEverybody is still exploring, he said.\n\nRachel Foubert is also undecided, but that wasn't always the case.\n\nThe 25-year-old teacher had committed to caucus for Kamala Harris. Now that thesenator from California is out of the race, Foubert is actively looking for the next person to support. She attended a Biden event in Williamsburg on Dec. 27, in part because it was close to her home in North English, about 30 miles away.\n\nBut Foubert has found no favorites yet that resonate with her the way Harris did. So she plans to see as many candidates in person as she can. The Biden event was the first for her. She said she was drawn to Biden's experience with foreign diplomacy.\n\nI just want someone who can beat Trump, Foubert said.\n\nSometimes the decisions come unexpectedly.\n\nMathew Kelly came to see Buttigieg at a town hall in Knoxville on Sunday with his young daughter. Kelly said he liked Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and he planned to give himself some time to make a decision.\n\nI think I just need to hear them speak and do more research, he said before Buttigieg addressed the crowd.\n\nAfter the event, Kelly signed a card committing to caucus for Buttigieg.\n\nRegister reporters Brianne Pfannenstiel and Austin Cannon contributed to this report.\n\nBarbara Rodriguez covers health care and politics for the Register.

Michael O'Hanlon\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhat should America's next president, Democrat or Republican, do about Afghanistan? With an electorate tired of forever wars and a new Pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with Russia or China, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete U.S. departure is palpable.\n\nInstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.\n\nBy the time America's next president is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, America's role in the Afghanistan War will be approaching its 20th anniversary. Afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the Soviet invasion there in 1979.\n\nWe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\n\nAmericans are understandably tired of this war. It has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first Obama term.\n\nHowever, the recent Washington Post story alleging that officials engaged in Pentagon Papers-like deception of the American public about the mission is badly misleading. Whether it was the initial Bush administration strategy on Afghanistan, the McChrystal review early in the Obama years, or any of the subsequent Obama/Trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\n\nNonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. Even more to the point for Americans, the United States has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within Afghan borders. The United States probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\n\nThe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. The good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\n\nA future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\n\nThe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. By laying out a plan designed to last for several years, Washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual Afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter Obama and Trump years.\n\nThe number of U.S. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. The size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the Afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. But for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\n\nPeace process:U.S. presidential hopefuls owe Afghan women their support\n\nThis idea for a smaller but enduring U.S. military presence in Afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the Democratic base. But Democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating President Donald Trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in Syria.\n\nOf course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.\n\nAl-Qaida remains present in Afghanistan and just over the border in Pakistan, where drones flying from bases in Afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. The presence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Afghanistan has been growing, too. Neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the United States.\n\nEven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of America's and NATO's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. Thus, Trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-Qaida and ISIS.\n\nWe cannot fight without boots on the ground\n\nSome will say terrorism in and near Afghanistan can be checked even without an American military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the Taliban. Perhaps any future al-Qaida or ISIS presence on Afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the Indian Ocean. Or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in Afghanistan.\n\nBut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\n\nWith 5,000 American troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in Afghanistan, the United States could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at Bagram near Kabul in the nation's center, near Kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either Khost or Jalalabad in the east. It also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in Kabul, to help the Afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\n\nIt's time to leave Afghanistan:Take the deal, President Trump; 18 years is enough\n\nThe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. It would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the Afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\n\nCommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to Pakistan and the Taliban that the new U.S. president would not be expecting a Hail Mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. Perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\n\nThe United States needs a policy that recognizes Afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, U.S. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. That overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Beyond NATO: A New Security Architecture for Eastern Europe.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Boy Scouts of America faces mounting legal liability as lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by leaders and volunteers continue to roll in, thanks in part to loosening statutes of limitations across the country.\n\nToday, lawyers with Abused in Scouting filed suit in Washington, D.C., on behalf of eight men who say they were abused as kids by Scout leaders and volunteers. The District in May eliminated time restrictions for sexual abuse survivors to pursue civil litigation and opened a two-year window for survivors under the age of 40 to file suit regardless of the date of the incident.\n\nSeparately, attorneys Gilion Dumas and Ashley Vaughn plan to file suit in California on behalf of 14 plaintiffs with similar claims. That mass action suit comes days after California's Assembly Bill 218 took effect, allowing victims of child sexual assault to file suit until age 40 and opening a three-year window for those abused as children to sue for past incidents.\n\nAttorney Paul Mones, who along with Dumas won a landmark $19.9 million verdict against the Scouts in 2010, said he expects a flood of litigation in California.\n\nWith the advent of all this consciousness of abuse in Boy Scouts, and all the things that happened in the last few years, there's going to be a tidal wave of cases against them.\n\nMones filed suit on behalf of a 17-year-old client in December in San Bernardino County Superior Court and estimates his firm has an additional 75 suits filed against Boy Scouts and as many as 200 more in the works.\n\nMore:Nearly 800 accuse Boy Scouts of failing to protect them from sex abuse as new lawsuit is filed\n\nMore:Boy Scouts, Catholic Church, more face new lawsuits as NY Child Victims Act window opens\n\nIn a statement, Boy Scouts expressed outrage that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our program to abuse innocent children.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America is committed to fulfilling our social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, the statement reads. The BSA has a multi-layered process of safeguards informed by experts, including the following, all of which act as barriers to abuse: a leadership policy that requires at least two youth-protection trained adults be present with youth at all times and bans one-on-one situations where adults would have any interactions alone with children – either in person, online or via text; a thorough screening process for adult leaders and staff, including criminal background checks and the prompt mandatory reporting of any allegation or suspicion of abuse.\n\nCalifornia and D.C. join a wave of states and territories that are extending time for survivors of child sexual abuse to press charges and seek civil damages. Since 2009, lawmakers in 38 states have introduced such bills, according to a USA TODAY analysis. Twenty-nine states have enacted laws, including New York, where at least a dozen cases have been filed against the Scouts since the new law took effect in August.\n\nThe push to extend statutes of limitations or eradicate them altogether came about in part through better understanding of how long it can take survivors grappling with trauma to come forward. The average age of disclosure is 52, according to CHILD USA, a think tank that focuses on preventing child abuse and neglect. Some people never disclose what happened to them.\n\nGrooming is very powerful. The predators who learn how to groom know how to isolate people and know how to do it very well, said Dave Henson, one of the eight John Does in Monday's suit in D.C.\n\nHenson, now 39, said he was abused by an assistant Scout leader over a span of five years, starting when he was 11. The grooming was so meticulous, Henson said, that he didn't realize the late-night touching that turned into penetration was abuse until years later, when he told his high school sweetheart.\n\nI wanted to be open and honest with her, and said, 'Hey, I've had a homosexual relationship, and she kind of looked at me weird. I explained to her what kind of happened, she again looks at me and said, 'You didn't have a homosexual relationship; you were abused.'\n\nEven after her revelation it didn't really sink in. I didn't really understand why I had all these emotions of shame and guilt, which led to drinking, a lot of drinking, Henson said. That's why these windows and statutes of limitations are so important, because it takes so long sometimes to come to that realization.\n\nHenson's attorneys are hoping to set a new precedent for survivors who live in states that have not opened so-called look-back windows or changed their statutes. The group, which has been running TV and Google ads encouraging victims to come forward, says it has signed more than 1,600 clients since last spring, many of whom live in states with restrictive statutes of limitations.\n\nAll eight of the plaintiffs in Monday's suit, including Henson, live in states that have not yet opened windows.\n\nThe problem with Boy Scouts is this is a national organization, and it's really a national problem, said attorney Aitan Goelman of D.C.-based Zuckerman Spaeder, an Abused in Scouting member firm. To have such disparate treatment of survivors based on an arbitrary geographical factor is not fair. It's not just.\n\nGoelman says D.C. is a proper venue for the suit because a congressional charter incorporated Scouts in the nation's capital in 1916. The charter also required an annual report to Congress on the activities of the organization.\n\nThe suit, along with nearly all reviewed by USA TODAY, alleges that Boy Scouts knew it had a rampant child sexual abuse problem as far back as the 1920s but concealed the issue to protect its wholesome image. In several cases, survivors accuse the Scouts of failing to stop known abusers from returning to their ranks and abusing again.\n\nDumas said her firm has successfully brought cases in Montana, Iowa, Idaho and Oregon on claims that Boy Scouts committed fraud by concealing their knowledge of the threat of sexual abuse within the organization.\n\nA suit filed in Arkansas in November alleges abuse against two former Scouts who say they were assaulted by a leader who had previously been reported to the Boy Scouts of America for abuse in Georgia. According to the suit, the leader had been added to the ineligible volunteer files but was later allowed to become a leader in Arkansas.\n\nBoy Scouts could have gotten ahead of this early on but literally chose not to, said Mones, who says his client in San Bernardino was abused up until 2018. I believe they've been trying to look at that problem, but the problem is that it's a day late and a dollar short.\n\nThe organization has begun to show the strain of mounting legal bills. Last year, reports began to emerge of a potential bankruptcy filing. Boy Scouts has denied a filing is imminent but said it is exploring all available options.\n\nIn October, the organization raised annual membership fees from $33 to $60, and last month it confirmed it had mortgaged the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, one of its most prized properties where troops from across the country go for days-long treks. It said similar liens are in place for other properties, according to the Associated Press, including its headquarters in Irving, Texas, and bases in Florida, Minnesota and West Virginia.\n\nOn Jan. 1, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints followed through on its plan to pull hundreds of thousands of Mormon youth out of Scouts in favor of its own program. That withdrawal means an 18% drop in already declining membership for Scouts, predicted to dip below 2 million for the first time since World War II.\n\nCara Kelly is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team, focusing primarily on pop culture, consumer news and sexual violence.

Reddit has banned a popular subreddit used by supporters of President Donald Trump, as more tech companies crack down in the wake of riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a statement, Reddit confirmed the subreddit r/donaldtrump was banned for repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAccording to a cached version of the subreddit, the channel had more than 52,000 members.\n\nReddit's site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals, said the social media platform in a statement. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed.\n\nSocial media:President Trump blocked from posting to Facebook, Instagram 'indefinitely'\n\nMichelle Obama:Former first lady calls for Trump to be permanently banned from social media\n\nDetails of the ban were first reported by Axios.\n\nIn the aftermath of riots in D.C. during which a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, social media companies have taken a more aggressive approach to statements from Trump. Facebook said it is planning to block Trump from the social network and Instagram indefinitely.\n\nWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post Thursday.\n\nTwitter temporarily blocked access to Trump's account, requiring him to delete tweets related to events at the Capitol. Meanwhile, video game streaming site Twitch disabled Trump's account. TechCrunch reports Snapchat also disabled Trump's account.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.
AP\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears might be ready to split with quarterback Jay Cutler.\n\nTop receiver Alshon Jeffery's future is in question. Change could be coming to the coaching staff, too.\n\nThe Bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the NFC North with a 3-13 record. They got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.\n\nNow, it's time to regroup.\n\nIt was all bad, linebacker Pernell McPhee said. I'm happy we're out of 2016.\n\nThe Bears are 9-23 in two seasons under John Fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.\n\nIt didn't help that 19 players finished the season on injured reserve, including Cutler and guard Kyle Long. Jeffery and linebacker Jerrell Freeman also served four-game suspensions for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nIt added up to the Bears finishing with their highest loss total since 1969 and missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years.\n\nI want to go to the playoffs, Long said. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin' playoff game in Chicago — can you imagine that?\n\nIt hasn't happened since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC title game. The Bears enter this offseason with the No. 3 pick in the draft and some big issues to address on their roster.\n\nWHO'S THE QB?: The biggest question facing the Bears? That's easy.\n\nThe Bears' all-time leading passer, Cutler has no guaranteed money left on the seven-year contract extension he signed in 2014. At 33, he was limited to five games because of a thumb injury and then a torn right labrum that led to him being placed on injured reserve.\n\nThen again, the Bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. That's an issue they need to address, whether they keep Cutler or bring in another veteran.\n\nJEFFERY'S FUTURE: Though it's not clear if he will still be with them, Jeffery guaranteed a Super Bowl championship for the Bears next year. He even compared them to the New England Patriots.\n\nWe're just like them, the only difference is just a few plays here and there, he said.\n\nJeffery played for the $14.6 million franchise tag this season. The Bears could tag him again if they don't agree to a multiyear deal, though that would be an expensive option to use on a receiver with a PED suspension and a history of injuries.\n\nIt would be easier to part with Jeffery if the Bears knew what they had in Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in 2015. But he was limited to four games because of a fractured left fibula after missing his rookie year with a stress fracture in his left shin.\n\nI'll be just fine, said White, who hasn't started running. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back.\n\nON STAFF: While Fox said last week he wasn't planning to make changes to his staff, he didn't quite slam the door on it, either.\n\nMaybe he and general manager Ryan Pace will provide more clarity on the status of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains when they meet with the media on Wednesday.\n\nThere was a report of friction between Fangio and Fox a few weeks ago. Fangio might also get interviews for head coaching jobs.\n\nLoggains came under scrutiny in his first season as Chicago's offensive coordinator.\n\nGETTING HEALTHY: The Bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.\n\nCutler, Long, White, nose tackle Eddie Goldman and linebackers Lamarr Houston and Danny Trevathan all wound up on IR. Other important players shuffled in and out of the lineup because of injuries.\n\nI think I'm just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year, said Long, who is recovering from ankle surgery and will undergo a less invasive shoulder operation. I'm going to look like the Christmas Story kid. It'll be summer months, I'll be in like three North Face (jackets). But, yeah, honestly, it's football. It's a tortured existence from a physical standpoint.\n\nBUILDING BLOCKS: There were some bright spots for the Bears.\n\nLinebacker Leonard Floyd showed promise with seven sacks after being drafted No. 9 overall, though he did suffer two concussions late in the season.\n\nJordan Howard broke Matt Forte's franchise rookie rushing record with 1,313 yards. Rookie Cody Whitehair looks as though he has a home at center.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
The bright orange Kenneth Cole suitcase circled the baggage claim carousel at Dallas Love Field with what looked like an antenna.\n\nA piece of wire was all that remained of the retractable handle on the hardside bag.\n\nI pushed it into the Southwest Airlines baggage claim office to file a claim, short on time and unsure of what came next. It was the first time an airline damaged my bag. Delayed bags, I knew the drill. Lost bags, too, as an airline permanently lost a bag of mine several years ago.\n\nHere's what I learned: Travelers have options when it comes to damaged bags, and knowing your rights will put you in a better position to resolve the claim.\n\nIf you have a claim, that is. An airline's definition of damage, backed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, may differ significantly from a passenger's definition. Normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.\n\nEvery airline damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. And it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking a designer bag.\n\nIf you have a Louis Vuitton (bag) and it goes through the (conveyor) belt system, it is not white glove service,'' said Lisa Ouimette, an analyst in American Airlines' central baggage services office. These are belt loaders. If you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.''\n\nAirlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zippers, as well as poor quality bags and bags that were damaged when checked in.\n\nSo what is covered?\n\nDamage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. The latter is a big problem in cold weather, Ouimette said. (So are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)\n\nWe anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,'' she said.\n\nPassenger rights if an airline damages your bag\n\nMore than 87 percent of U.S. travelers don't file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by AirHelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. The three main reasons: They didn't think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights and they did not know how to file a claim.\n\nAirlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline's control, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection division.\n\nThe cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. Many use Dallas-based Rynn's Luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.\n\nIf a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a like bag or passengers will be reimbursed. The reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the DOT says, subject to liability limits.\n\nFor flights within the United States, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is $3,500. The limit on international flights, per the Montreal Convention, is about $1,600, the agency says.\n\nAirlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the DOT.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're going to get $3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (The higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)\n\nMy suitcase wasn't new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. I worried that Delta Air Lines, which I was flying the next day out of Dallas, wouldn't accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.\n\nSouthwest baggage representatives in Dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn't doubt I needed a new bag. But they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (I never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)\n\nThey asked how old my bag was, where I purchased it and how much I paid for it. They took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. They couldn't find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. I didn't recall how much my bag was or where I purchased it but estimated it at between $150 and $200. A repair never came up.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. One was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. The hardside bag wouldn't fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so I initially passed.\n\nAmerican's Ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. She ordered a bunch for American for the busy holiday season. Many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.\n\nI was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me if I bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of Dallas the next morning. I didn't have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.\n\nIn the middle of the baggage claim office, I unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.\n\nI wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport's Uber pick-up area. I didn't make it. The wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.\n\nI fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn't work. They were apologetic, again. I repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag I bought, never setting a price limit. I didn't buy one in Dallas; a generous friend I was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.\n\nJust before Christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, I bought a bag I'd had my eye on, a $245 Away carry-on bag . It was nowhere near as big as the Kenneth Cole one Southwest broke, but my friend's bag took care of my big-bag needs and I was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.\n\nMy claim was finally resolved the day after Christmas in Phoenix. I landed at Sky Harbor International Airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from Providence.\n\nI submitted my receipt for $260, which included taxes. It took the agents time to find my claim because I didn't have my damage incident report'' and they were having computer issues.\n\nA supervisor offered $200, a figure noted in my report by the Dallas agents. I told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.\n\nWe'll split the difference, how's that?'' she asked.\n\nAt 1 a.m., I walked out of the office with a check for $225.\n\n5 things to do if an airline damages your bag\n\n1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.\n\n2. Don't rip off your baggage tags. The airline will need them.\n\n3. Be calm and courteous. A banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn't going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.\n\n4. Know the approximate value of your bag and where you purchased it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.\n\n5. Jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it's not resolved immediately. Airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. Not getting the answers you want? Ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline's central baggage services office.\n\nMajor airline policies on damaged bags:\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nMore:Travel nightmares: What to do if you miss your flight
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday and said he might declare a national emergency at the border after Democrats refused to yield to his demands for money for a border wall.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump abruptly ended the White House session after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she did not support his border wall.\n\nHe just got up and said we have nothing to discuss, and he walked out, Schumer said. He just walked out of the meeting.\n\nSchumer called Trump's behavior unbecoming of a president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Republican lawmakers disputed the Democrats' account and said the meeting ended after Democrats refused to offer a counterplan to reopen the government.\n\nTrump gave Schumer and Pelosi the floor to state their case, but they want to argue, said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nTrump treated the Democrats politely, McCarthy said, but they reacted with embarrassing behavior.\n\nTrump confirmed that he walked out of the session, writing on Twitter, Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\n\nThe end of what was supposed to be a new round of bipartisan talks came on the 19th day of a partial government shutdown – the second-longest in history – that was triggered by Trump's demands for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and Democrats' refusal to give him the money.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump said he was still considering declaring a national emergency on the border if negotiations with Democrats fail to yield a deal on funding for the wall.\n\nI think we might work a deal (on the government shutdown), and if we don't, I may go that route, he said. I have the absolute right to do (a) national emergency if I want. … My threshold will be if I can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\n\nAn emergency declaration theoretically would allow Trump to use military money to build the wall. Democrats and some Republicans have questioned the legality of such a move, saying an emergency declaration would be challenged in court.\n\nBefore Wednesday's failed bipartisan meeting, Trump and Pence traveled to the Capitol for a closed-door luncheon with Senate Republicans.\n\nAfterward, Trump reiterated that he might pursue a national emergency declaration to get funding for his wall if Democrats don't agree with the fact that our country really has problems with crime.\n\nTrump portrayed a sense of unity among Republicans, though some have suggested opening portions of the government while negotiations over the wall continue.\n\nThere was no discussion about anything other than solidarity, Trump said. The Republicans are totally unified.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also stressed that Republicans remain solidly behind Trump in the budget standoff. But at least three GOP senators – Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – have publicly said the Senate should at least consider a House plan to reopen the government.\n\nThe operations of the Department of Interior and the National Park Service or the operations of the IRS and whether or not tax refunds go out don't have anything to do with border security, Murkowski said Tuesday. So let's bifurcate these issues. Let's set them aside. Let's allow for the operations, these governmental functions in these six other departments, allow for them to continue.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 240-188 Wednesday to approve a bill that would fund the Treasury Department and the IRS so Americans' tax refunds wouldn't be delayed because of the shutdown. Eight Republicans voted with Democrats to pass the bill.\n\nThe House will take up three bills to fund the remaining shuttered departments this week. None of the measures is likely to get a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nThe White House threatened to veto all four bills, saying they are unacceptable without a broader agreement to address the situation on the border.\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, Christal Hayes and Trevor Hughes
WASHINGTON – The warnings about climate change are dire: bigger floods, larger fires, larger storms.\n\nMost experts agree there's little to prevent these catastrophes without swift action on climate change.\n\nEnter Rep. Kathy Castor, the Florida Democrat that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has chosen to chair the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.\n\nA Capitol Hill veteran and clean energy champion with a background as an environmental lawyer, the Tampa Democrat plans to shine a light on the very climate issues many Democratic candidates ran on in November to win back the House.\n\nOver the next 15 months, the panel will make policy recommendations, push for legislation and cast a spotlight on the growing dangers of man-made global warming that's spelled out in a chilling a federal report released in November.\n\nWe are in a race against time, Castor, 52, told USA TODAY recently.\n\nThe committee already faces obstacles:\n\n• Republicans, who have consistently downplayed the effects of climate change, say the panel is unfairly partisan (nine Democrats vs. six Republicans).\n\n• Progressives, who support a comprehensive approach known as the Green New Deal, worry the committee won't be aggressive enough.\n\nThe panel will only be able to do so much.\n\nIt won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. It ultimately will have to rely on standing committees to adopt its recommendations. And any ambitious measures are unlikely to win passage in the Republican-held Senate or be signed by President Donald Trump who has dismissed global warming as a hoax and made environmental deregulation a cornerstone of his economic agenda.\n\nCastor spoke with USA TODAY about the charge of her committee and the challenges it faces:\n\nQ: Much of the information on climate change is out there. So what do you hope to accomplish with this new committee?\n\nCastor: We're going to press for dramatic carbon pollution reduction. We want to win the clean energy future to defend the American way of life and avoid catastrophic and costly weather events that have dire impacts.\n\nQ: What are some of the issues you want to pursue and how will you work with the standing congressional committee to achieve them?\n\nCastor:Right off the bat, we will tackle fuel economy standards, make sure the Commerce Committee and the (Transportation and Infrastructure Committee) are focused on that. The Financial Services Committee has to do a flood insurance reform bill. We will be involved in that as well.\n\nQ: You mentioned flood insurance. Representing a coastal district, you know what flooding and storms can do. Should we rebuild along the shore?\n\nCastor: We shouldn't be insuring at taxpayer expense homes and businesses that have been destroyed repeatedly on the shore. Folks know full well that they're in hurricane's path or flood's path and they do that on their own. I'm concerned the (flood) maps are not up-to-date, that states and local communities are not acting fast enough to adopt policies to revise maps.\n\nQ: Is there a concern you may getting in the way of standing committees who are already charged with environmental protection and climate change issues?\n\nCastor: No, we're going to be complimentary. This is a collaborative effort. It's just being elevated because the threat to our way of life is at stake. It's all hands on deck.\n\nQ: What's your response to Republicans who say the panel will be stacked with Democrats and have too much latitude to go after issues beyond its scope?\n\nCastor: Look, we've had so much delay and Republicans have had their heads in the sand here in the Congress. I've just been through a time in the minority on (the) Energy and Commerce (Committee) where they refused to have even one hearing on the climate or hear any legislation dealing with the escalating cost of climate of extreme weather events. And I do see our jurisdiction as being very broad. We're talking about the planet.\n\nQ: How will the committee go about highlighting the consequences of climate change?\n\nCastor: We intend to tell the stories of communities that are taking action despite the inaction from the Congress and the Trump administration. There are some conservative, rural areas that are going renewable and reducing carbon pollution and we're going to shine a light on their good work. And for bad actors that know better, we intend to make sure they're famous as well.\n\nQ: Even if the House passes ambitious measures, their chance of becoming law is slim given the positions of the president and the Senate. So why try?\n\nCastor: We don't have time to wait. Whatever we can press to accomplish as soon as possible, we will do that.\n\nThe politics:Climate change: Democrats see Trump, GOP inaction as 2020 opportunity\n\nRelated:Once Democrats take charge of the House, addressing climate change will become top priority again
WASHINGTON — A presidential candidate is accused of arranging hush money to conceal a mistress in a sensational story ripped straight from the tabloids.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSix years ago, federal prosecutors put two-time Democratic presidential contender John Edwards on trial for just that and ended up failing to convict the North Carolina politician. Now, the Common Cause watchdog group wants the Justice Department, the Federal Election Commission and Congress to investigate a $130,000 payment that President Trump's lawyer is alleged to have arranged weeks before the 2016 election for a former porn actress in an attempt to cover up her purported affair with Trump.\n\nCampaign-finance experts say these cases are tricky to prove, and Washington politics — the Justice Department, the Federal Election Commission and Congress are all controlled by the president's party — seem likely to doom any probe into whether federal laws were violated.\n\nI have real doubts that the Department of Justice has the independence and the fortitude to go after this, said Peter Zeidenberg, who served as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section during George W. Bush's administration.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Session's decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in the 2016 election already has caused a deep rift in his relationship with Trump.\n\nMore:Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed by Mueller's team as part of Russia investigation\n\nI think Jeff Sessions is scared to death about losing his job, Zeidenberg said. He's trying to curry favor with the president at every turn, and I think that he would think that this a bridge too far for his agency to investigate the reported payment.\n\nIn its complaints to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Common Cause argues that the alleged payment to Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, likely violated federal campaign-finance laws as an unreported, in-kind donation to Trump's campaign.\n\nCampaign contribution limits in effect during the 2016 election capped direct donations to a candidates at $2,700 for a primary or general election. In addition, corporations are prohibited from giving campaign donations to congressional and presidential candidates.\n\nOn Tuesday, Common Cause also sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees, asking them to take up the matter.\n\nJustice Department officials did not immediately respond Tuesday to an inquiry about the Common Cause request. An FEC spokesman said agency officials cannot comment on complaints.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer identified by the Wall Street Journal as having arranged the payment to the actress through a limited liability company, said the complaints lack merit.\n\nThe Common Cause complaint is baseless along with the allegation that President Trump filed a false report to the F.E.C., Cohen said in an emailed statement.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Cohen has said the president vehemently denies a relationship with Daniels. Cohen also released a statement from Daniels denying an affair or the receipt of a payoff from Trump.\n\nThe Journal unearthed a corporate document showing that Cohen created a limited liability company, Essential Consultants LLC, in Delaware on Oct. 17, 2016, less than a month before the election. A bank account linked to that company sent the payment to the client-trust account of Daniels' attorney, the newspaper reported.\n\nLast week, gossip magazine In Touch Weekly ran a previously unpublished interview with Daniels from 2011 who described an affair with Trump that began in 2006, a year after he had married Melania Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the alleged payment to Daniels came in October 2016 as Trump's campaign grappled with release of an Access Hollywood tape in which Trump talked about groping women. Daniels also had been in talks with ABC's Good Morning America that fall to discuss Trump, the Journal reported.\n\nThe timing of this payment is strong evidence that this was payment for the purpose of influencing an election, rather than concealing the affair from Trump's family, said Paul Ryan, Common Cause's vice president for policy and litigation.\n\nIt was a decade-old relationship he had with her, Ryan said of the alleged affair. So, why then?\n\nMore:Porn star Stormy Daniels' alleged affair with Trump takes new twist with old interview\n\nMore:Analysis: Why the latest allegations of a Trump affair are unlikely to hurt the tabloid president\n\nIn Edwards' case, his lawyers argued $1 million in secret payments to Edwards' pregnant mistress by Edwards' donors were aimed at shielding his wife, Elizabeth, who died of cancer in 2010, not hiding the information from voters.\n\nThe six-week corruption trial against Edwards ended with acquittal on one count, and the jury deadlocked on five other charges.The Justice Department opted not to retry him.\n\nThese are fact-sensitive cases that are tough to prove, Kenneth Gross, a veteran campaign-finance lawyer, said Tuesday. You have to get to the bottom of where the money came from and what was the intent of the payment.\n\nAt the Federal Election Commission, which often deadlocks along party lines, commissioners would have to vote to open a campaign-finance investigation. And a vacancy on the commission has left Republicans in the majority.\n\nEven as Ryan argued for the investigations, he acknowledged that the politics make this tough.\n\nThe FEC has been for years mired in dysfunction and now has a Republican majority of commissioners, he said, and the DOJ (Department of Justice) is within the executive branch of government headed by the president.
Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story cited the wrong source for data about anxiety Americans face over finances. The original data came from MoneyLion.com.\n\nAll things considered, now is a pretty good time to be an active participant in the U.S. economy.\n\nJobs are plentiful. The market has been on a winning streak. And while rising interest rates are a mixed bag, savers can at least rest easy knowing their emergency cash will soon start to earn just a bit more.\n\nIt's somewhat surprising, then, to learn that despite all of these factors, more adults have a negative financial outlook than a positive one. In a recent GOBankingRates report that cited MoneyLion.com data, 28% of Americans say they feel anxious about their finances, compared with just 19% who feel optimistic. And that's a pretty startling pill to swallow, especially since most Americans also believe they'll earn more money in 2018 than they previously did.\n\nWhy are Americans so anxious? In a previous GOBankingRates survey, the reasons boiled down to never being able to retire, always living paycheck-to-paycheck, and being in debt forever. But if those are the issues at play here, there are some solutions that can help.\n\nNever managing to retire\n\nAfter a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. But a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. In fact, nearly half of U.S. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And that's a problem, because Social Security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. Or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. Neither is ideal.\n\nThe solution? Start saving now, even if in small increments. The beauty of investing your retirement savings (which both IRAs and 401(k)s allow for) is that you have the ability to turn a series of relatively modest contributions into a rather impressive sum over time.\n\nCheck out the following table, which shows what saving just $300 a month consistently can do for your nest egg:\n\nIf you start saving $300 a month at age: Here's what you'll have by age 65 (assumes an average annual 8% return): 25 $932,000 30 $620,000 35 $408,000 40 $263,000 45 $165,000 50 $98,000\n\nData source: author.\n\nOf course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. Keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an IRA or 401(k). For the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. For the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. Max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.\n\nLiving paycheck-to-paycheck\n\nA big reason Americans are stuck living paycheck to paycheck is their tendency to save too little and spend too much. If you'd rather break that cycle, then here's what you need to do. First, create a budget, which will help you see where your money is going and how much room for savings your expenses allow for. Only once you have that budget in place will you be in a good position to identify which bills to slash.\n\nAnd that leads to the second thing you'll need to do, which is start cutting expenses if your current budget doesn't allow you to save at least 10% of your paycheck month after month. Whether you choose to reduce one major expense, like your home, or a series of smaller ones, like your cable bill and takeout habit, is up to you. But you will need to lower your spending if you're tired of the paycheck to paycheck routine.\n\nOne additional option you can also consider is picking up some sort of side hustle. Though it's not easy swinging a second gig on top of a full-time job, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can boost your income and use that extra money to pad your savings account. Furthermore, working that extra job might give you the flexibility to cut fewer expenses, thus contributing to a better quality of life.\n\nMore: Only 39% of Americans are ready for a $1,000 unexpected expense\n\nMore: Millennials: 1 in 6 now have $100,000 socked away\n\nMore: Retirement planning: 18 frequently asked 401(k) questions\n\nDying in debt\n\nNever managing to get out of debt is a valid concern, especially since the average household carrying a balance is on the hook for a whopping $16,000. Still, there's no need to resign yourself to taking that debt with you to the grave, especially if you're willing to make an effort to pay it off.\n\nHow? It's simple -- just employ the same tactics. Trim expenses from your budget, work extra, and free up cash to apply to your debt. From there, pay the bills that are costing you the most in interest, and work your way down. You can also look into a balance transfer, which may be a good option if your credit itself is relatively strong despite your debt.\n\nIf you're starting 2018 with a relatively negative financial outlook, here's your chance to turn things around. You can salvage your retirement, stop living paycheck-to-paycheck, and break free from the evil cycle of debt. You just need to shift your priorities a little and start making changes for the better.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Kim Tong-Hyung\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea – North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil, went into hiding with his wife in November, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers in Seoul on Thursday. A high-profile defection by one of North Korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong Un as he pursues diplomacy with Seoul and Washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.\n\nSouth Korean lawmaker Kim Min-ki said an official from Seoul's National Intelligence Service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. Kim did not say whether the spy agency revealed any information about Jo's current whereabouts or whether the diplomat had plans to defect to South Korea. Kim said the NIS said it has not been contacted by Jo.\n\nKim said the NIS official said that Jo and his wife left the official residence in early November, weeks before his term was to end in late November. Kim said he couldn't confirm whether the NIS official revealed whether Jo and his wife were accompanied by any children. The NIS earlier said it couldn't confirm a South Korean media report that Jo was under the protection of the Italian government as he seeks asylum in a Western nation.\n\nNorth Korea has not yet commented on Jo's status.\n\nAn official with the Italian Foreign Ministry said the North Korean hadn't requested asylum from Italy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standard practice, said Jo no longer held diplomatic status in Italy. That presumably refers to his government's ending his diplomatic assignment to Italy and his being recalled.\n\nNorth Korea, which touts itself in its propaganda as a socialist paradise, is extremely sensitive about defections, especially among its elite diplomatic corps, and has previously insisted that they are South Korean or U.S. plots to undermine its government.\n\nNorth Korea may publicly ignore Jo's possible defection or hold back harsh criticism to avoid highlighting the vulnerability of its government as it pursues diplomacy with Washington and Seoul, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University.\n\nThe last senior North Korean diplomat known to have defected is Thae Yong Ho, a former minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, who fled to South Korea in 2016.\n\nWhile not identifying him by name, the North's state media then described Thae as human scum and claimed he was trying to escape punishment for serious crimes.\n\nThae, who has been an outspoken critic of Kim Jong Un while living in South Korea, denied the accusations and said he defected because he didn't want his children to live miserable lives in the North.\n\nIt's possible that Jo is trying to defect because of similar reasons, said Koh, who is a policy adviser for South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It could be difficult for some diplomats to accept being called back to the North after enjoying years living in the free West. They could want their children to live in a different system and receive better education.\n\nThe highest-level North Korean to seek asylum in South Korea is Hwang Jang-yop, a senior ruling Workers' Party official who once tutored Kim Jong Un's late father, dictator Kim Jong Il.\n\nHwang's 1997 defection was hailed by many South Koreans as an intelligence bonanza. Hwang died in 2010.\n\nIn 1997, the North Korean ambassador to Egypt fled and resettled in the United States.\n\nNot much is publicly known about Jo, who had been North Korea's acting ambassador to Rome after Italy expelled then-Ambassador Mun Jong Nam in October 2017 to protest a North Korean nuclear test.\n\nKim, the lawmaker who listened to the spy agency's briefing, said the NIS official said the agency has yet to figure out many details about Jo.\n\nAbout 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, according to South Korean government figures. Many defectors have said they wanted to leave North Korea's harsh political system and poverty. North Korea often accuses the South of deceiving or paying people to defect, or claims that they have been kidnapped.
Jeffrey Ball\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt seems a sensible solution: To slash emissions of the greenhouse gases dangerously warming the planet, force polluters to pay for what they cough out. Slapping a price on carbon, the argument goes, should prod companies and consumers to go green, from electric cars to renewable energy to diets lower in meat.\n\nBut mounting evidence suggests that carbon prices are like unicorns and fairy dust: dazzling in concept and all but meaningless in practice.\n\nMore states, regions and countries than ever are putting prices on carbon emissions. Europe has done it, certain U.S. states have done it, Canada is doing it, and China, the world's biggest emitter, is moving to do it. Yet global emissions are surging to new highs.\n\nOUR VIEW:Greenhouse gases blowing the wrong way for America\n\nOne-fifth of all global emissions, the World Bank says, are now subject to a carbon price — either a tax or a market in mandatory pollution permits known as cap-and-trade. Nevertheless, energy-related carbon emissions jumped 1.6 percent in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency, and they likely rose more in 2018.\n\nWhy aren't carbon prices curbing global warming? They tend to constrain emissions only in certain parts of the economy. And even there, politicians tend to lack the guts to set the prices high enough to change much. Little wonder that, according to World Bank figures, less than 1 percent of global emissions are subject to a carbon price that economists believe is high enough to change much.\n\nSo carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive. By providing the illusion that they're effectively dealing with climate change, they reduce pressure for tougher policies that could meaningfully curb emissions, such as phasing out coal as an electricity fuel except where it's paired with carbon-capture technology; maintaining existing nuclear plants; and making renewable energy cheaper.\n\nClimate change, an existential challenge, deserves a massive response. In the future, perhaps carbon pricing will work. So far, it looks like a diversion.\n\nJeffrey Ball is scholar-in-residence at Stanford University's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.

Philip Reed\n\nNerdwallet\n\nCar shoppers are often pressured into buying an extended auto warranty — so-called because it kicks in to cover repairs after the new-car warranty expires — even though they don't know their odds of using it or what it really costs.\n\nFor those with buyer's remorse, there's good news — most warranties can be canceled and you'll get a prorated amount refunded.\n\nThe question then becomes, do I need that extended warranty I bought? And, if not, how do I get my money back?\n\n'An expensive gamble'\n\nExtended warranties, often called vehicle service contracts, are sold by the finance and insurance manager while creating your sales contract. These warranties cover repair costs for varying lengths of time or miles driven after the manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper warranty ends.\n\nThere are factory warranties, backed by the carmaker, with repairs made using original manufacturer parts, as well as third-party warranties that often require you to request a reimbursement and use after-market parts.\n\nConsumer Reports, calling extended warranties an expensive gamble, found the median price for coverage was just over $1,200. The results of the 2013 survey, its most recent, showed that 55 percent of owners who purchased an extended warranty didn't use it. And those who did use it spent hundreds more for the coverage than they saved in repair costs, on average, the survey found.\n\nMore:These 6 vehicles were the hottest-selling cars of 2018: Jeep, Toyota, Tesla make the list\n\nAndy Meisler, a retired journalist in Los Angeles, was offered an extended warranty when buying a Toyota Prius but he decided not to take that bet.\n\nAfter driving the car for 10 years, Meisler said, That car never needed more than routine maintenance.

PHOENIX — The same week the Trump administration opened a hotline in April to support victims of crimes by immigrants, Elena Maria Lopez called to report a complaint against her ex-husband.\n\nAt first, Lopez kept getting a busy signal.\n\nBut finally someone answered. For the next 20 minutes, Lopez provided a detailed account, accusing the Dutch immigrant of marrying her to get a green card and then threatening to harm her if she contacted immigration officials.\n\nWhat happened next shocked Lopez.\n\n► Jan. 19:The worst states economically for Hispanics and Latinos\n\n► Jan. 17:Deportation of Ohio woman was in error, appeals court says\n\n► Jan. 16:Can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? Yes.\n\nNot only did Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that operates the hotline, decline to take action, but immigration authorities also released much of the private information she provided. This includes a confidential Internet phone number she fears will now make it easier for anyone to locate her in New Jersey, where she has a protected address set up for domestic-violence victims.\n\nLopez is one of hundreds of people whose private information was inappropriately released by ICE when the agency posted call logs to the hotline on its website, a clear violation of the agency's own policies against divulging private information as well as privacy laws intended to protect individuals who provide sensitive information to the government.\n\n► Jan. 13:Chicago pays tribute to its Haitian founder after Trump vulgarity\n\n► Jan. 13:Federal government begins accepting DACA renewals\n\nThe agency also released some of the same information to The Arizona Republic in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nLopez contacted the newspaper after ICE officials notified her through telephone calls and emails that private information she provided in confidence was inadvertently released to the newspaper.\n\nI was very upset because I do my best to protect my privacy for my safety and I was especially upset that it was the Department of Homeland Security that gave out my personal information, she said. The same agency that claimed it had to protect my ex-husband's rights just destroyed my privacy and my safety.\n\n'This is a serious problem'\n\nThe agency's release of private information underscores problems that have surfaced since ICE launched the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, or VOICE, to serve the needs of crime victims and their families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration.\n\nThe office includes a telephone hotline that was not intended to report crimes but to answer questions from victims, according to the VOICE website. Instead, callers have treated it has a crime hotline, using it largely to accuse people of being in the country illegally or of violating immigration laws, according to telephone logs the agency released The Republic.\n\nThis is a serious problem and obviously will further discourage people from attempting to interact in any way with the federal government on immigration matters, said immigration policy analyst David Bier at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nVictims and witnesses of crimes already are hesitant to provide information to the government because having that information out in the public could pose a serious threat to them and to their family, he said.\n\nPresident Trump called for the creation of the VOICE program in an executive order on immigration in January 2016, which directed the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to take a tougher stance on illegal immigration and immigration-law violators.\n\nIn a written statement, ICE officials admitted that the agency erred in divulging private information protected by policy and law.\n\nWhen the agency receives evidence suggesting that non-releasable information is unintentionally available, immediate actions are taken to ensure proper mitigation both to correct and to prevent further disclosures, the statement said.\n\nThose action include temporarily removing and reviewing the entire contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library, the statement said. The library contained thousands of pages of data and documents the agency previously had released in response to requests.\n\n► Jan. 8:Trump orders 200,000 Salvadorans to leave U.S.\n\n► Jan. 5:Man gets 9 months in deaths of 5 Mexican immigrants in basement\n\nThe contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library were restored Oct. 16, the agency said.\n\nThe agency also offered identity-threat monitoring services to people affected because of the improper disclosure of private information, the statement said.\n\nLopez said ICE offered her two years of identity-theft protection and credit monitoring.\n\nIn truth, that does nothing for me, Lopez said.\n\nClaims of immigration fraud\n\nLopez said she became hopeful when Trump said he was creating the VOICE office.\n\nFor more a decade, she said she has tried unsuccessfully to get immigration authorities to investigate her ex-husband, Erik Niehof, a Dutch immigrant. He disputes her allegations accusing him of marriage fraud and domestic violence.\n\nLopez is also the creator of a website, immigrationfraud.com, which provides a forum for victims of marriage fraud.\n\nIn March, Lopez testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing into marriage and fiancé visa fraud, describing how she was tricked by the love of my life into getting married.\n\nThen out of the blue, on the night of our second anniversary, he coldly announced we were divorcing. I assumed we were just having marriage problems, suggested counseling.\n\n\n\nHe flat out refused. And then came the cruelest words I've ever heard: … He said our marriage was nothing but a practicality so he could get a green card.\n\nLopez further testified that her ex-husband became violent after learning she had filed for separation and planned to withdraw her immigration sponsorship for his green card.\n\nHe tried to strangle me and threatened to kill me if I ever contacted immigration officials, she testified.\n\nShe also accused her husband of being involved in criminal activity in the Netherlands and claimed he never should have cleared Department of Homeland Security background checks and allowed into the United States.\n\n► Dec. 6:Illegal crossings at U.S.-Mexico border hit historic low\n\n► Nov. 30:Undocumented immigrant not guilty of murder in polarizing case\n\nAfter reporting the allegations to the VOICE hotline, she said she received a call from a caseworker who told her they could not do anything.\n\nThey concluded they couldn't get involved in order to protect his privacy rights, Lopez said, adding that the caseworker suggested she call a Department of Homeland Security tip line.\n\nReached in Pennsylvania, where he works selling cars at a luxury auto dealership, Niehof strongly disputed Lopez allegations. Now remarried, with a child, he accused Lopez of continuing to pursue false claims of marriage fraud and domestic violence against him and inventing stories about his nonexistent criminal past in the Netherlands out of vengeance after their marriage fell apart 16 years ago.\n\nBasically, this was just a marriage that ended up really bad, and, 'I am going to get back at you and I am going to do that through immigration service,'  Niehof said of Lopez. This is her vengeance.\n\nNiehof said originally he didn't want to move to the U.S. but agreed to apply for a visa and get married after his ex-wife visited him in the Netherlands when they were dating but didn't want to live there.\n\nHe said immigration authorities have sworn affidavits from mutual friends that their marriage was entered in good faith.\n\nHe also said immigration authorities have investigated Lopez's claims against him several times and concluded they were unfounded when he applied for permanent residency in 2002 and then to renew his green card 10 years later, pointing out that he was approved both times.\n\nIn 2016, Niehof said U.S. immigration officers briefly detained him upon returning from a vacation abroad with his family after his immigration record was flagged because of his ex-wife's allegations. While he waited, immigration officers looked into his record, then welcomed him back into the U.S., which he said would not have happened if any of her allegations were true.\n\nThat is probably why (immigration authorities) haven't made a case of this because there is no validity in any of it, he said. She is out for vengeance.\n\nRecords inadvertently released\n\nAmong the private information included in the database ICE released to The Republic was Niehof's personal immigration identification number, known as an A number, along with the name and address of the auto dealership where he works.\n\n• On July 31,The Republic filed a Freedom of Information Act request request for any and all criminal activity reported to the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Sept. 8, in response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet via email containing ICE call logs of 643 people who called the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Oct. 4,The Republic received a clawback response letter from Erin Clifford, chief of ICE's government information law division, alerting the newspaper that records released contained personally identifiable information of third parties, law enforcement sensitive information, and potentially deliberative information.\n\nThe letter concluded by asking the newspaper to confirm that you have returned, destroyed or sequestered all copies of the record and to provide ICE with a list of any disclosures that have been made.\n\nConfusion over hotline's purpose\n\nA review of the call logs released shows that many people contacted the hotline to turn in acquaintances, spouses, relatives, neighbors, and business owners they suspected of being in the country illegally or of having committed crimes.\n\nHowever, ICE's webpage describing the purpose of the VOICE program explicitly states that the hotline is not to report crime. It directs callers to report crimes to local police or ICE's designated crime hotline.\n\nSummaries of the call logs that ICE released included names of crime victims, addresses, and phone numbers as well as names, addresses, places of employment, phone numbers and A-numbers of immigrants being accused of crimes or of being in the country illegally.\n\nFor example, one summary reads: Caller requested to report a possible illegal immigrant who may have an order of deportation. Caller stated the illegal immigrant abuses her children. Caller stated the illegal immigrant is his neighbor and she lives at (street address), Perth Amboy, NJ.\n\nAnother summary reads: Caller requested to report business who hires undocumented aliens. Caller claims there are approximately eight undocumented aliens at this farm located at: (street address), North Olmstead, Ohio. 44138.\n\nThe call logs also show the hotline has received numerous prank calls such as this one: Caller requested to report an alien outside his house and has green skin color.\n\nAnd this one: Caller identified himself as a victim. Caller then requested assistance reporting an illegal alien. Caller provided the name Gabba Tha Hut and address as 1600 Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. That is the address of the White House.\n\nDoes program have ulterior motive?\n\nBier of the Cato Institute said he supports government efforts to provide more information about cases to crime victims as well as informing them of other services available.\n\nI was torn about the program in general when it was first announced because I honestly believe we treat victims in the United States of crimes very poorly, he said. We give them very little information about what's happening in the case. As a general rule, we as a society need to treat victims much better than we do now.\n\n► Nov. 23:MS-13 gang member arrested after murder victim stabbed over 100 times\n\n► Nov. 3:Islamic State claims responsibility for NYC terror attack without evidence\n\nBut the program's problems and its narrow focus only on victims of crimes committed by immigrants suggests the program has ulterior motives, he said.\n\nThe administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, Bier said. I think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. So I think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to Americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.\n\n► Oct. 30:Man deported by ICE after helping Detroit cops\n\n► Oct. 28:No Social Security number? No electricity\n\nFor her part, Lopez said she now completely has lost faith in ICE after the agency declined to look into her case and then released private information she provided.\n\nThis is just one more example of how dysfunctional the Department of Homeland Security is, Lopez said.\n\nContributing: Ryan Santistevan and Agnel Philip, The Arizona Republic.

PROTECTING THE SHIELD: Read our investigative series\n\nPhilip Seidle hates being called a killer cop.\n\nThe former Neptune police sergeant spends his days mostly alone, locked in a maximum-security cell at New Jersey State Prison, the facility for the state's toughest inmates.\n\nIt is true I killed and I was a police officer, Seidle wrote in an online message to the Asbury Park Press following a November court hearing in which a headline termed him a killer cop.\n\nINTERACTIVE GRAPHIC: Scroll towards the end of the story to explore the chain of events between Seidle and police officers during the shooting.\n\nThat particular phrase chaffed him. The term is unnecessary, Seidle wrote. It feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.\n\nOnce entrusted with a badge and a gun to protect the town he called home, Seidle, 53, is no longer trusted with a real pen.\n\nIn evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, Seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the Press in the summer to discuss his crime. The prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. The floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.\n\nI killed my wife, and the mother of my children, the most horrific thing, Seidle wrote. I destroyed my children's lives. What I did is absolutely unacceptable. I can't forgive myself, and don't hold out any hope they ever will.\n\nExclusively for Insiders: Philip Seidle's thoughts - Inside the mind of a killer cop\n\nSeidle also spoke exclusively to the Press through phone calls facilitated by his one-time mistress. They still tell each other I love you on the calls.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, Tamara Wilson-Seidle on June 16, 2015, in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.\n\nI just think I had a mental breakdown. I just – because of all the stress that I was under and the anger that I had, Seidle said. I just blacked out that day.\n\nSigns of domestic problems in the Seidle home were long known to Seidle's colleagues, his supervisors, his chief, neighboring police departments, and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, documents and interviews show.\n\nSeidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. His .40-caliber Glock, though, was returned to him. It was the weapon he used to gun down Tamara.\n\nIn his 22-year career, Seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.\n\nHis secret internal affairs file tops 600 pages.\n\nThe Press is suing Neptune to make the file public. A judge could decide the matter next month.\n\nWhat is known is that police responded to at least nine domestic incidents between the Seidles and 10 custody disputes – with police providing an escort during at least one custody confrontation.\n\nSeidle shared his psychologist's notes that detail the emotional devastation he said he felt during the custody battle with his ex-wife. Both Seidle and his ex-wife filed for domestic violence restraining orders, alleging past abuse.\n\nThis is a story about the two Phil Seidles.\n\nIn the community, Seidle was known as an upstanding officer – respected by citizens, looked up to by colleagues, a loving father of nine.\n\nBut beneath that public persona, Seidle's stress and frustration were no secret to his colleagues and supervisors. Both he and his ex-wife made claims of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle denied claims that he abused his ex-wife.\n\nTamara did not become a victim until I killed her that day, he wrote.\n\nThe Seidles' multiple domestic disputes were handled by authorities as isolated incidents, not looked at as a continuing pattern, public police records show.\n\nThe domestic issues caused Seidle to be suspended from his department at least twice and disarmed at least once, records show. Seidle said he was also disarmed a second time. He was sent by his department for psychological review at least three times.\n\nYet Seidle returned to duty, armed and frustrated.\n\nTamara's death at age 51 left their nine children without parents, prompted a multimillion-dollar legal claim by the kids and tainted the careers of two responding officers.\n\nBorn in Munich, West Germany, Tamara Wilson-Seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. She was a cheerleader and Neptune High School homecoming queen in 1982. She coached soccer. She was a devout Catholic, serving as director of religious education for the Mother of Mercy Parish.\n\nWhen Seidle was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, their eldest daughter described Tamara as the soul and the light of their family.\n\nHer killing shocked those in the community who knew Seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of Catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.\n\nMonmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. He issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. But that report excluded the Seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove Seidle to kill.\n\nSeidle said he began to unravel during Tamara's pursuit of child custody, which he felt rose to criminal interference. The day he killed her, he shouted about his kids as he stood in the street with his pistol to his head.\n\nI'm tired of it! I'm tired of it! I got nine f------ kids she stole from me! Seidle ranted, all of it picked up on a police dash camera recording.\n\nSeidle said he was devastated by his fraying relationship with his children and the warming relationship between Tamara's new boyfriend and the Seidle children.\n\nAfter two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, Seidle wrote in an online message. You continue trying, but nothing works. Everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. Then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. Then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. Perhaps you take it lightly? Maybe you think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.\n\nYou tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.\n\nSeidle said he struggled to deal with stress at home. He said he should have been on medication, maybe an antidepressant or antianxiety drug. He should have moved away from the situation with his ex-wife.\n\nSeidle's chief acknowledged investigations uncovered major problems with Seidle, according to a court document.\n\nOne police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the Seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.\n\nBetween the work issues and the domestic violence complaints and the 911 calls to his house, someone, someone has to take the responsibility and tying all that together and saying there's a significant concern, said Michael D'Angelo, a retired police captain who served 23 years in South Miami Police Department, including performing internal affairs duties, and now works as a consultant on civil cases involving police.\n\nMore than three years before the shooting, Tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by Seidle show. She claimed Seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. Seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. Tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.\n\nThree years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in Neptune and a sergeant in Tinton Falls when they handled a confrontation between the Seidles, according to a police report. Higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.\n\nLess than a year before the shooting, Seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children. He handed in his badge and gun. But Seidle said his colleagues encouraged him to return. He was put back on the job and rearmed.\n\nLess than four months before the shooting, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.\n\nTwo months before the shooting, Seidle filed a criminal complaint alleging that Tamara violated a judge's custody order by preventing Seidle's visits and phone calls, the court document shows.\n\nSix days before the shooting, a letter shows Bradley Beach Municipal Court Judge Richard B. Thompson found no probable cause for Seidle's criminal complaint, saying the issue was a civil matter.\n\nThen on the morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle learned Tamara's new boyfriend had been spending time alone with the Seidle children.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember chasing Tamara's car through the streets of Asbury Park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. He doesn't remember running Tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. He doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.\n\nHe does remember confronting his ex-wife in a church parking lot.\n\nThen he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.\n\nI realized I had shot her, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was born to unmarried parents in April 1964 in Philadelphia.\n\nHe wrote that he felt his father abandoned the family.\n\nAfter high school, I didn't believe myself to be disciplined enough to go to college. Wanting to travel, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July of 1982 at 18, he wrote.\n\nI met Tamara in Oct. of '89 through a mutual friend of ours, with whom I'd been stationed with onboard both (U.S.S) Nitro and the Philly commissary. We talked on the phone for several months and began dating in February of 1990. She became pregnant in April 1990…\n\nThey were both 26. They married in August 1990, in St. Peter Claver Church in Asbury Park, court documents show. That's about half a mile from where Seidle shot Tamara.\n\nSeidle was honorably discharged from the Navy and hired by Neptune Township Police Department in July 1993.\n\nWithin a year of his hire, the department knew about Seidle's trouble at home. In March 1994, Seidle called Neptune police after Tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. But then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither Seidle nor Tamara filed a criminal complaint.\n\nYou know, there were a lot of problems, Seidle said in a prison phone call. But we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.\n\nBound by Catholic doctrine, the Seidle marriage was a cycle of faith, sin and reconciliation. For decades, there were showdowns documented by police and later in court between the Seidles, with each making allegations of domestic violence against the other.\n\nInternal affairs expert D'Angelo reviewed the special report on the Seidle shooting issued by Prosecutor Gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.\n\nSomewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – I don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, D'Angelo said. You investigated your officer several times. If you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, I mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.\n\nEven Seidle acknowledged the repeated calls should have warranted further scrutiny, though he contends that his ex-wife was lying to the police.\n\nThe thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? He said. Why is she constantly calling the police? Why does she continue to call the police for these matters?\n\nGramiccioni's report underscores a failing in New Jersey police policy.\n\nThis review and analysis disclosed a critical flaw in the domestic violence policies and procedures that currently exist statewide, the report stated. The report also raised concern with officers who are the subject of numerous internal affairs complaints.\n\nGramiccioni has since established an early warning system in which Monmouth County departments are required to report to the prosecutor's office if an officer meets criteria like being involved in a domestic violence incident.\n\nGramiccioni's report was produced by his office after the New Jersey Attorney General's office found no conflict of interest with the prosecutor's office investigating. The report largely absolves those who oversaw Seidle, including the prosecutor's office.\n\nWhile the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of Tamara Seidle. Philip Seidle did, Gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. With hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented Seidle from brutally killing Tamara Seidle on that fateful day in Asbury Park. It's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.\n\nSeidle wrote from prison that Gramiccioni was protecting his office from legal liability.\n\nThat declaration was for the civil suit, Seidle wrote. And basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. They cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. I think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the Attorney General's Office allowed it.\n\nIn an interview, the prosecutor's office limited its comments on Seidle, pointing to the children's lawsuit.\n\nMany people surrounding the Seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the Seidle children in the lawsuit, the Seidles' priest, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton, the Seidles' divorce attorneys, the Neptune police chief, and former police director.\n\nDespite trouble at home, Seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. He was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.\n\nI had a few bumps the first couple years, he wrote of his career. I had a number of car accidents (minor), and fell and cut my eye open. I studied on and off the job hard to learn the law, and how to survive on the streets as a proactive officer. I earned a reputation for being very knowledgeable in the law, and for making good arrests.\n\nSeidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. He was credited for police work in Asbury Park Press stories. He helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. While patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. He received a commendation from the 200 Club of Monmouth County – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.\n\nHe provided letters of support citizens wrote on his behalf.\n\nIn the last week I had occasion to be in touch with your Patrolman Philip Seidel (sic) on three occasions and I wanted to let you know that I found him to show good judgment and professionalism on each occasion, Ruth E. Buck, proprietor of The Shelburne Hotel, wrote in June 1994.\n\nSeidle wrote often about his children. He was there for each of the nine births, he wrote. He coached sports, chaperoned class trips and attended their parent-teacher conferences and religious sacraments. Seidle's younger half-brother provided photos of Seidle with his kids at a wrestling match, a soccer game, in an ice cream shop.\n\nThere were many good times, Seidle wrote. To most people on the outside, we had the perfect family, because we were always together. We did everything as a family…But the marriage was dysfunctional.\n\nAnd his department knew about that dysfunction.\n\nIn 2001, police responded to a screaming match that escalated to Tamara pushing Seidle, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nProblems persisted, and worsened, Seidle wrote.\n\nTamara stopped working to stay home with the kids after their sixth child was born, Seidle wrote. She nearly died during the birth of their seventh child and underwent a gall bladder surgery in 2002, Seidle wrote. She lost her mother and father within a year.\n\nShe shut down and stopped tending to her responsibilities, Seidle wrote.\n\nTheir problems deepened, but still they stuck it out.\n\nI grew impatient over the next couple years, and in the later part of 2004, I had an extramarital affair, Seidle wrote. It lasted three months. I ended it because I knew it was wrong, and did not want to continue to mislead my wife, and commit adultery.\n\nSeidle wrote that he believed Tamara also had an affair.\n\nThey went to marital counseling.\n\nSeidle considered a separation in 2006, he wrote, but Tamara was opposed to it. Neptune police came to their home in March that year for a verbal dispute, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nBy April 2010, I'd decided to leave, Seidle wrote. I had told myself I would stay for the kids, and being a Catholic, divorce was frowned upon. I was making an effort to live my faith. But I reached the point I resented being around her, and even living in my home.\n\nHe planned to leave in January 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. But in October 2010, Tamara told him she had breast cancer.\n\nSeidle helped Tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. Seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with Tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.\n\nBut after an ordeal that might draw couples closer together, the Seidles grew further apart.\n\nAnd then came more calls to the police.\n\nSeidle began seeing Gloria Patricia Chavarriaga. A divorce document filed on Tamara's behalf claimed this happened during her cancer treatment, which ended in June 2011.\n\nChavarriaga told Tinton Falls police she suspected Tamara once flattened four tires on Chavarriaga's car because of who Chavarriaga was dating, according to a December 2011 report. But Tamara denied it and Chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.\n\nSeidle met Chavarriaga through church. Chavarriaga, 54, knew Seidle for years professionally before they were involved romantically, she told a reporter. She was a single parent and Seidle helped with her daughters. She admired the way Seidle loved his children.\n\nThey walk straight, Chavarriaga said of the children. They are good kids. That says a lot when children behave because obviously, someone is teaching them the right thing.\n\nSeidle mentored Chavarriaga's daughter, Samantha Rittman, who is now 24 and living in Virginia Beach.\n\nSeidle was stern with Rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, Rittman recalled. He was supportive of Rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.\n\nHe never turned his back on me, she said. Ever.\n\nShe recalled that Seidle was distressed about not being with his children.\n\nHe was constantly a mess over his kids, Rittman said. That's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.\n\nRittman never expected violence from Seidle, she said. Seidle didn't seem like that kind of person.\n\nI was angry for a while, I was really angry, she said. Angry because Seidle hurt Chavarriaga. He made Chavarriaga happy and Rittman thought they'd have a future together.\n\nI just feel like what he did was selfish, she said.\n\nSeidle left Tamara in January 2012, he wrote.\n\nPrior to doing so, I took the six oldest (children) and spoke to them, telling them I was leaving because I was unhappy, and that their mom and I were not getting along, he wrote. I did nothing to embarrass either of us, and wanted to do nothing to make the children feel responsible, or be in the middle.\n\nThen there were two reports of domestic incidents involving Seidle in January and February that year, according to the prosecutor's report. Tinton Falls police responded to a confrontation between Seidle and one of Chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. Seidle provided the Press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that Seidle put his hands on her.\n\nSix days later, Neptune Township police responded to a confrontation at the Seidle home. Seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument. When police arrived, Tamara made allegations of past abuse similar to claims she would make when she filed for divorce and for a restraining order. Seidle said these were lies.\n\nSeidle said Tamara wanted to get back at him.\n\nShe wanted revenge for me leaving, he wrote. She knew there were two things important to me… my children and my reputation. She wanted to take away both of those things to hurt me the way I had hurt her by leaving.\n\nSeidle was suspended for two days in February 2012 because his department felt he interfered with the police response. Seidle said he was trying to make sure proper protocol was followed. Seidle was sent to a police psychologist. Seidle was deemed unfit for duty.\n\nSeidle said he told the doctor that I was extremely upset by Tamara's lies, and did not want to be at work during this time, as I would have trouble focusing.\n\nHe wrote that he was found unfit because he asked to be. His unfitness was not on any finding of psychological dysfunction, or disorder, Seidle said.\n\nHe remained off duty until May 2012.\n\nI was ordered by my chief to 'stay away' from Tammy for my 'own good,' he wrote of his return to work. Then-police Chief Robert Adams could not be reached for comment.\n\nTamara filed for divorce in June 2013, claiming abuse. Seidle denied those claims in court and interviews.\n\nTamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the Press, but the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office ignored them in its final report.\n\nAllegations made by Philip and Tamara Seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.\n\nTamara sought sole custody of the children. At the time, six were younger than 18. Seidle was ordered in October 2013 to pay $3,000 in alimony and $2,606 in child support each month, based on earnings in 2012 worth $11,930 before taxes, according to a court document.\n\nSeidle said the fight over child custody hurt him deeply.\n\nI couldn't cope, he wrote. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate. I suffered from depression, anger, anxiety, high blood pressure. I was a mess. My emotional well-being spiraled out of control.\n\nPolice reports show Neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the Seidles, including a custody dispute. Both Seidles and the Seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.\n\nBut Gramiccioni's report made no mention of police escorts and set aside the calls for custody disputes, saying they do not constitute incidents of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle explained how the fight over the children led to the ultimate tragedy.\n\nIt went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, Seidle said. That's where it went wrong. It was just a continuum. There was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… I love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. More than anything in the world I cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. I wanted to be the father that I never had.\n\nSeidle provided notes from a psychologist, Raymond Hanbury, who counseled Seidle and documented his struggle starting in 2012, after he was found unfit for duty by a department psychologist. Hanbury didn't respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nHe does get emotional when he talks about his lack of contact with the children because Tammy makes it difficult, Hanbury wrote in an entry dated March 28, 2012.\n\nHanbury wrote in May 2014 that Seidle's issues with Tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. Hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for Seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current Neptune Police Chief James Hunt.\n\nSeidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, Hanbury wrote in November 2014.\n\nDivorce is finalized, Hanbury wrote in an entry two weeks before the killing. However, he was upset with Tammy because she reportedly threw his personal items out. They include Navy papers, training certificates and personal items that meant something to him.\n\n\n\n'But they're gone,' the psychologist wrote, apparently quoting Seidle. 'I need to focus on the children.'\n\n\n\nIn an undated final entry, Hanbury wrote: On June 16, Phil shot his ex-wife, fatal, and was arrested. There were no indications or signs of something like this to happen. He denied in sessions that he would do anything to jeopardize his being with the children, especially the younger ones.\n\nSeidle dismissed the effectiveness of the therapy.\n\nSending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.\n\nThe dispute over child custody led to more police calls to the Seidle home, departmental discipline for Seidle and rising tension between the Seidles.\n\nIf they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? Seidle asked. Doesn't matter whether I was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.\n\nLocal law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the Seidle household.\n\nSeidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.\n\nCapt. Lawrence Fisher was there for me in every way during this whole ordeal, Seidle said. He saw me crying and things that went on with me emotionally when nobody else was around. Fisher could not be reached for comment\n\nSeidle said department supervisors knew of his problems.\n\nThe line supervisors, they were all aware, Seidle said. They knew what was going on, they knew that there were problems…you know there were times that I came to work late. I reported late because I had to be, I was in court. I had to be in court. And then just all the police reports that I made. And I spoke to them constantly.\n\nOver a period of two years, my performance suffered, and I received poor evaluations for what was described as poor decision making (lack of focus). On the evaluations they repeatedly indicated I was an outstanding officer with a good reputation, but my performance was suffering due to personal problems.\n\nSeidle's chief knew.\n\nPolice Chief Hunt took over in September 2014 from Chief Adams, who retired.\n\nIn legal testimony, Hunt said he became aware of Seidle's issues before the shooting.\n\nHe didn't disclose in depth that he was having – it was kind of everyone knew he was having problems, Hunt said. He was close to certain officers in the police department, but he didn't come to me and say hey, Chief, I am having major league problems.\n\nHunt said in the deposition: Just through our investigations into this and internal affair investigation is where we learned what the major problems were.\n\nHunt described three issues with Seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a DWI case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and Tamara.\n\nFor those issues, Seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, Hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. Seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.\n\nThe prosecutor's report acknowledged the incident in which Seidle argued with officers, and his suspension, but didn't mention the issue Seidle had with evidence or the botched DWI case.\n\nPunitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said. The punishments hindered his ability to pay child support, alimony and his own bills because suspensions cut his six-figure pay, he said. He said he leaned on Capt. Fisher for sympathy and, at one point, to pay the rent.\n\nHis department's reactions didn't address the real problem, he said from prison – stress related to his troubled access to his children.\n\n\n\nThe chief thought the answer was to punish me, Seidle said. You know, if I forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish Phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that I was under stress and I was just having trouble coping. Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.\n\nIn one incident about 11 months before the shooting, Seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the Ocean Grove boardwalk. He said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. He told the Press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.\n\nThe teen's employer called police, according to the prosecutor's office report. Police interviewed the children, who said they didn't want a relationship with Seidle, according to the report.\n\nSeidle said he was called into Hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told Seidle his daughter accused Seidle of harassing her at her job. Seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by Tamara.\n\nSeidle became frustrated.\n\nI'm tired of being intimidated and threatened by my wife every time we have a disagreement or something goes on between the kids, he recalled telling the chief.\n\nSo, he said he was retiring.\n\nI gave him my badge and my gun and I told him: 'that's it, I'm going to resign because I'm just fed up,' Seidle said.\n\nAfterward, he said he talked to two colleagues, Capt. Fisher and Sgt. J. Hunter Ellison. Ellison also couldn't be reached for comment. Fisher would later respond to the scene the day Seidle shot Tamara.\n\n…They all tried to convince me not to leave, they told me it wasn't a good idea, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in August 2014.\n\nHe returned and the department gave him back his .40 Glock.\n\nTrouble spread beyond Neptune.\n\nIn Tinton Falls one night in 2012, Tamara admitted she had been drinking and followed Seidle to the gym because she thought he was headed to see his mistress. Seidle called the police, she left by the time they arrived and Seidle declined to file a complaint.\n\nThe responding Tinton Falls officer contacted Sgt. Doug McEntegart. McEntegart spoke by phone with a Neptune Township lieutenant, a police report shows.\n\nHe informed me that there has been ongoing domestic incidents with the Seidles, and after a brief discussion on that, I assured the lieutenant that a report for harassment would be written documenting the incident, McEntegart wrote.\n\nBoth McEntegart and the Neptune lieutenant notified higher-ranking officers. McEntegart also briefed an assistant Monmouth County prosecutor. In an interview, First Assistant Prosecutor Lori Linskey said this was a police officer asking for legal advice, which doesn't mean a case was opened by the prosecutor's office.\n\nIn Asbury Park the year before the shooting, Seidle said he and Tamara got into a custody dispute at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a church and school where Seidle would later confront Tamara the day she died.\n\nThe argument prompted an Asbury Park police response, according to Seidle. He provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date Seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. The city denied having access to the document.\n\nThe next day, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by Tamara.\n\nAt least three times, the Seidle drama reached as high as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.\n\nIn addition to being notified about the Tinton Falls incident, the prosecutor's office was notified of the 2012 argument at the Seidle home in which Tamara alleged past abuse and they signed off when Seidle was later rearmed.\n\nThe prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which Tamara reported to police that Seidle was harassing her, then Seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nTheir report shows Seidle wasn't disarmed after this incident. Seidle told the Press that his gun was taken away again around this time.\n\nNeptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about Seidle's problems and when they knew it.\n\nThe township denied the Press access to the 682-page internal affairs report on Seidle on the grounds that it was a confidential employee record. Seidle's internal affairs history was not released in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nThe Press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how Seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.\n\nIn a Nov. 3 hearing, Monmouth County Assignment Judge Lisa P. Thornton remarked on the number of internal affairs incidents.\n\nAs a lay person, it seems to me like an excessive amount, she said.\n\nWhile his IA file remains secret, documents did emerge publicly showing two citizens complained in 2004 that Seidle used excessive force during arrests, according to documents attached to a lawsuit alleging excessive force during a 2015 arrest. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge and Seidle was cleared by his department in the 2015 incident.\n\nOne complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nI never, you know, was written up or had any incidents where I abused my authority or where I used excessive force against someone, Seidle said generally about his discipline. I never was punished for anything like that.\n\n\n\nA reporter sought official copies of documents provided by Seidle and his half-brother, though many were denied by the government.\n\nIn addition to denying the hundreds of pages of Seidle's internal affairs history, Neptune also denied access to 15 police reports naming Seidle, including 11 which also name Tamara, saying they are criminal investigatory reports. The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.\n\nSeidle insists he didn't plan to kill his ex-wife.\n\nThe morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle said he drove past the family's house. He had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on Father's Day.\n\nHe was supposed to pick up their youngest daughter at the family home on Heritage Court but she didn't come outside. Tamara was already at work.\n\n\n\nA congratulations banner was still over the door. The family threw a party the weekend before for two of the eldest children. They were the first in Seidle's lineage to graduate from college.\n\nSeidle, though, was suspicious of a car with Georgia plates in the driveway. He jotted down the license plate number. He assumed it was her boyfriend.\n\nHe called Tamara.\n\nWhose car is that in the driveway? He asked.\n\nNone of your business, he recalled Tamara saying.\n\nIt is my business. If this guy is living there, that's a problem, Seidle said.\n\nHe said she wasn't supposed to have someone living there if he's paying alimony. And he was concerned about another man around their children.\n\nSeidle's eldest daughter dropped his youngest daughter off at his home on Walnut Street in Neptune. Seidle deduced that a man had been spending time with Tamara and the children. The kids had mentioned his last name before, his parents spent time with the kids. He was at the graduation party.\n\nThen all of this started just hitting me, Seidle said. That was where the emotion started spiraling out of control.\n\n\n\nSeidle left his home with his 7-year-old daughter and his gun belt. The off-duty 6-foot-4, 230-pound police sergeant was dressed in a peach polo shirt, navy shorts and brown sandals on the sunny day. He wore a Bluetooth earpiece.\n\nHe called Tamara as he was walking out of his home.\n\nIs this guy living there? He asked.\n\nShe was busy and couldn't talk, Seidle recalled.\n\nIf he's living there, there's going to be a f------ problem, Seidle said.\n\nI've got to go, Tamara replied, he said. She told Seidle that one of their children would have a father with or without you.\n\nSeidle was shocked and hung up the phone.\n\nTamara told her boyfriend and her eldest daughter that Seidle threatened to kill her, according to grand jury testimony Seidle provided to the Press.\n\n\n\nSeidle said he drove up Route 18 in his silver Honda Pilot, heading toward Monmouth Mall.\n\nHe spoke to his daughter, who confirmed Tamara's boyfriend had been staying at the house for two weeks.\n\nSeidle slid into an emotional tailspin because her boyfriend was being left alone with Seidle's kids, taking over the role of the father, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle thought he would never get his kids back.\n\nI believed she was jeopardizing my children's safety, as well as my ability to repair my relationship with them, he wrote.\n\nHe said he called Tamara several times.\n\nShe texted him back: What do you want.\n\nSeidle cut off the highway at Route 66 and drove to the church.\n\nShe didn't answer the phone, Seidle said. I said 'OK, well if she won't answer the phone I'm gonna go to the job and I'll talk to her and get her to talk to me and see what's going on.'\n\nHe said he didn't expect to find her in the parking lot. When he saw her there, he thought they would talk, but she pulled away in her car.\n\nEverything just went downhill from there, Seidle said. I just blacked out. Spiraled. My emotions were – I just got overloaded with the emotions.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.\n\nJust emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. And I just broke down and just, I don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.\n\nHe chased her west on First Avenue, south on Central and west on Asbury Avenue, grand jury testimony shows. His car struck her car near Jimmy's Restaurant, knocking off the front license plate of Seidle's SUV.\n\nThree people lingered on their home porch on Sewall Avenue in Asbury Park. A worker ate a sandwich in his nearby car. An employee at a plumbing supply company down the street retrieved tools from a truck.\n\nResponding to a fender bender on the corner, Asbury Park Patrol Officer Ahmed Lawson followed the routine procedures, asking for driver's license, insurance and registration.\n\nThen a car horn, screeching tires. The two Seidle cars tore around the corner of Ridge Avenue, nearly hitting Lawson as he jumped out of the way.\n\n\n\nSeidle's SUV smashed into the rear of Tamara's black sedan, ramming it into another parked car.\n\nOnce he exited the vehicle, he began shooting, Lawson told investigators.\n\n\n\nThe camera on Lawson's patrol car recorded the sounds of the shooting. Eight shots can be heard in the video in quick succession, then a ninth shot.\n\nLawson can be seen in video ducking behind his patrol car, away from Seidle.\n\nProsecutor Gramiccioni said Lawson was too far away to effectively shoot Seidle.\n\nLawson recognized him. He begged for Seidle to drop his weapon.\n\nHey Phil! Drop that gun Phil! Lawson yelled before ducking back behind his patrol car.\n\nSeidle's voice can be heard on the video.\n\nNow what!? Seidle shouts.\n\nLawson gave the location over the radio, shouting for backup, noting that Seidle had the gun to his head and that he was a sergeant from Neptune. Seidle's daughter ran to responding officers and Asbury Park police Capt. Marshawn Love. Love had been their neighbor for more than a decade and recognized the cars as belonging to the Seidles. He drove Seidle's daughter away from the scene.\n\nSeidle fired another volley of four shots through the front window two minutes after the first.\n\nHe fired all but one round in the magazine of his Glock.\n\nWith his left hand, Seidle held the gun to his head. For about 45 minutes, officers held their fire, trying to coax Seidle into surrendering. He shouted profanity, furious about being kept apart from his nine children.\n\nWith his right hand, he typed a text message to the children:\n\nYour mother is dead because of her actions…\n\nGoodbye forever.\n\nNearly 70 officers from four agencies surrounded Seidle within minutes.\n\nOfficers begged Seidle to put the gun down, many calling to him by his first name.\n\nA Monmouth County prosecutor's detective, Asbury Park Detective Lt. David DeSane and another officer removed Tamara from her car, the grand jury testimony shows.\n\nShe was pronounced dead minutes later at Jersey Shore University Medical Center.\n\nNeptune Capt. Fisher pleaded with Seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. Fisher had worked with Seidle for years. Seidle said Fisher had seen him cry.\n\nHim and I were very close over the years, Seidle said. And I wanted to kill myself. But at that moment I just felt like I couldn't do it because him and I were very close and I didn't want to leave him with that memory.\n\nYou owe me that much, Seidle recalled Fisher saying at the scene.\n\nOfficers told Seidle if he dropped the gun he would get to see his kids.\n\nDeSane left the scene to get Seidle's kids, sending a photo of them to another detective who remained at the scene. That detective slid his phone to Seidle.\n\nThey said they'd take his kids to a prosecutor's satellite office in Asbury Park. Ten minutes later, they showed him another photo of the children.\n\nSeidle lowered his gun. He placed it on the ground.\n\nSeidle and Fisher embraced.\n\nWhen it was all over, I just felt like falling out, like collapsing, Seidle said. And I remember when he came, when he came into the street I just, I don't know, I fell into his arms.\n\nSeidle was taken to the prosecutor's outpost in Asbury Park and escorted into a conference room, grand jury testimony shows.\n\nThe prosecutor's detective explained that he would let Seidle speak to the children, but Seidle couldn't mention what he did to their mother.\n\nSeidle agreed.\n\nHe was placed in a chair and given a bottle of water. They led his children into the room in two groups.\n\nFor years, Seidle had fought in court to get more time with his kids. The custody disputes with Tamara derailed his career. The thought that another man was moving into their lives triggered a breakdown.\n\nSeidle had wanted to be the father figure he never had.\n\nBut there he was, arrested on a murder charge the week of Father's Day.\n\nSeidle and the children exchanged few words.\n\nI just told them that I love them and that I only wanted to have a relationship with them and that I was sorry, he said.\n\nThen he was led away to jail.\n\nThat was their last conversation.\n\nSeidle was taken to the Monmouth County Jail a few miles away in Freehold. His clothing, his photograph and his fingerprints were taken. It was a process the veteran cop had performed on detainees many times, but now Seidle was on the other side. Besides training at the police academy, he said that was the only day he had been in handcuffs.\n\nAll of it was unbelievable, he said.\n\nAs reality sank in for Seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from Sewall Avenue, making headlines across the region.\n\nThe first thing he did in jail was to ask for a priest. Seidle said he confessed his sin and asked for absolution.\n\nThe week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended Tamara's Catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. The children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing Seidle and responding to the shooting. A notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. Neptune, Asbury Park and Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nThese days, Seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. He is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to inmates, collecting their trash after dinner, picking up their laundry. He takes an antidepressant. He gets recreation time with other inmates, indoors, separated in individual cages with a port through which they can play cards or chess.\n\n\n\nHe telephones Chavarriaga, who he called his partner, in the morning and evening. He sleeps well at night. He thinks about his children, especially on holidays and birthdays.\n\nHe unsuccessfully appealed his sentence. He said he didn't deserve 30 years, but declined to say what would have been an appropriate sentence.\n\nThis firm defended Phil Seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, Edward Bertucio. He avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not outlive. Instead we negotiated aggravated manslaughter and the sentence he received was lengthy. We appealed it. We did everything we could for him. I wish him the very best.\n\nSeidle found fault in how many people treated him. He said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned Tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.\n\n\n\nBut he doesn't pass blame for the killing.\n\nI carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.\n\nSeidle hopes someday he can apologize directly to his children.\n\nI don't expect them to forgive me, he said. But I just want them to know how sorry I am.\n\n\n\nHe said he does believe in an afterlife.\n\nI believe that God forgives us for all of our sins, especially when we ask him, he said. And I think that one day, you know, I will have the opportunity to tell Tamara, hopefully, how sorry I am for what I did to her.\n\nSeidle will become eligible for parole in December 2040, when he'll be 76.\n\nHe plans to make it there.\n\nThere's no doubt about it, Seidle said. I will walk out of these walls one day.\n\nDesign and development by Felecia Wellington Radel.

James S. Robbins\n\nThe clear message to Iran and other rogue states seeking nuclear weapons from North Korea's claimed test of a hydrogen bomb is, go for it. No one is going to stop you.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pyongyang announced that it had successfully tested a hydrogen weapon which it called the H-bomb of justice. Seismic sensors confirmed that some sort of event had happened, though the U.S. government has not confirmed that it was a hydrogen bomb test. If true, the test would demonstrate a deadly quantum leap in North Korean nuclear technology and send a destabilizing message worldwide. In any case, another nuclear test of any sort is an affront to global order.\n\nFor decades, United States policy has been that a nuclear North Korea is unacceptable. Yet Washington keeps on accepting it. Prior to its first surprise nuclear test in 2006, the U.S. said it would not permit North Korea to have a nuclear weapon. After the test, the policy became to not let the Kim regime have any more nuclear weapons. And after subsequent tests in 2009 and 2013, the government played the same tape over and over. The White House says it is deeply concerned; the North Koreans say, you should be.\n\nIt is not as though the international community has done nothing, it has just done nothing effective. North Korea has been placed under a barrage of strong economic sanctions related to its nuclear program in the last few decades. It has been the subject of numerous multinational talks and several important agreements. But these measures failed. One of the poorest, most technologically backward countries in the world now seems to have joined the most elite, most deadly club on the planet. North Korea has proved that talk is cheap and sanctions are useless against a country determined to go nuclear.\n\nNorth Korea has bedeviled more presidents than just Obama: Column\n\nThe rogue world is watching. Iran in particular must be taking note of the international response to North Korea's latest provocation. The two countries have allegedly cooperated on nuclear development. The al-Kibar nuclear facility in Syria that the Israeli Air Force bombed in 2007 was purportedly funded by Iran and built and maintained by North Koreans. Iran's nuclear mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi was reported present for North Korea's 2013 nuclear test.\n\nTehran is counting down to Implementation Day for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a.k.a. the Iran nuclear deal, when tens of billions of frozen dollars will be released and sanctions will be lifted. There are no restrictions on how this money can be spent, and administration officials have admitted that it may be used to further destabilize a region in the grip of sectarian war. North Korea's example shows Iran that they might as well invest it all in banned nuclear programs and push ahead for the bomb.\n\nAmerica between a Shiite and a Sunni place: David Andelman\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe Obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to Iran's deal-breaking behavior. In October Iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions. None of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. However, the White House chose to delay punishing Iran for these violations, though Reuters reported that spokesman Josh Earnest said President Obama would not stand in the way if U.S. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit U.S. national security. This frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells Tehran that anything goes.\n\nHow President Obama and other world leaders respond to the H-bomb of justice will send signals far beyond the Korean peninsula. If history is any judge, there will be some angry statements and expressions of concern, followed by inactivity until North Korea pushes the envelope again. And Tehran knows that if it tests an atomic weapon, it will get away with it just like Pyongyang.\n\nJames S.

Martin Rogers\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nLOS ANGELES – Jurgen Klinsmann's player selection policy for the United States national team is seriously flawed, unfair, and affects the squad's quality of play, according to Major League Soccer midfielder Benny Feilhaber.\n\nFeilhaber, who scored the winning goal for the USA in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup final and now plays for Sporting Kansas City, has been frozen out by Klinsmann despite Feilhaber saying he is in the form of his life.\n\nThe 31-year-old insisted that he and several other players – many of them from MLS – are not given an opportunity to prove their worth by Klinsmann, no matter how well they perform at club level.\n\nAlex Morgan went on 'The Bachelor' and tried to teach everyone to play soccer\n\nI don't know what that reason is, Feilhaber told reporters on Tuesday. I don't know if Jurgen doesn't like these players, he doesn't like their attitude, he doesn't like their faces, he thinks they are ugly. I don't know.\n\nFeilhaber continued: If you ask me it can't possibly be based on on-field performances. There are plenty of guys in MLS that have had better seasons than other guys, in MLS or other countries, that are getting opportunities for the national team.\n\nKlinsmann has been criticized in some quarters for relying heavily on naturalized players who grew up and developed their soccer talent overseas, such as Germany-raised Jermaine Jones, Fabian Johnson and Timmy Chandler, and Scandinavia-raised Aron Johansson and Mix Diskerud.\n\nHowever, Feilhaber was adamant he has no problem with the head coach's policy regarding foreign imports, merely the way he says Klinsmann rules out certain individuals regardless of their current form.\n\nMix Diskerud responds to Abby Wambach's criticism of USMNT playing 'foreign guys'\n\nI've accepted the fact that Jurgen's not going to call me, said Feilhaber, who has made 41 appearances for the USA, played in the 2010 World Cup, but has not figured since 2014. If I play the year that I played this last year, and I'm not getting a call, then I'm not going to get an opportunity under Jurgen.\n\nIn regards to how a coach should approach a team … there are two duties – one is making the best possible team that you can possibly make with the players that are available to you. And two, try to continuously improve that team so that team doesn't stall in any way and continues to improve.\n\nFor me, Jurgen seems to try and do the second one without doing the first one. He would rather put young guys on the team that potentially could become somewhat important on the team and he leaves out players that could make the team better right now.\n\nThat's the number one job of a national team coach. Not to make the team as good as he can make it in five years, to make it as good as he can make it now and continuously improve it. (In that way) he doesn't do his job. There are players in the player pool that do not get called in that have performed well enough on the field to get an opportunity.\n\nFeilhaber highlighted MLS players such as midfielders Sasha Kljestan and Dax McCarty of the New York Red Bulls, and defenders Matt Hedges of FC Dallas and Eric Lichaj of Nottingham Forest in the English Championship as examples of candidates whose form has not been rewarded by Klinsmann.\n\nAn example … I can see how Dax can help the national team, Feilhaber said. He plays in his position that in my opinion would help (USA captain) Michael Bradley become a better player.\n\nDax is a guy that can sit in that pocket and allow Michael to operate in front of him and I think that he does it in a way that is better, or at least competes, with people who are tying to do the same thing on the national team right now.
Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt was a line buried in an Office of Congressional Ethics report that tipped me off to members of Congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a Turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in Turkey.\n\nUnder the new rules House Republicans approved late Monday then abandoned Tuesday, I never would have seen the report.\n\nThe 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.\n\nBut the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee.\n\nUnder the rules changes pushed by House Republicans on Monday night, OCE would have had to stand down.\n\nRead more:\n\nHouse Republicans drop plan to gut ethics office\n\nHouse Republicans move to slash powers of ethics watchdog\n\nHouse ethics board drives transparency, controversy\n\nIt is not the first time OCE has provided information to the public that the Ethics Committee could not or would not release. In 2010, then-congressman Nathan Deal, R-Ga., resigned while the Ethics Committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in Georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. His resignation meant that the Ethics Committee lost jurisdiction over him, but OCE decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. Under the new rules, it would have lost that right.\n\nIn fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.\n\nSince the OCE was created in 2008, it has publicly released about 70 reports on investigations of members of Congress and staff. By comparison, in 2007, before the OCE was created, the Ethics Committee announced reviews of conduct of four members of Congress. Two cases involved lawmakers who were facing charges in court; the other two were for improper trips taken four years earlier.\n\nOn the Senate side, with no similar independent ethics review body, the Senate Ethics Committee has not publicly announced a single investigation against a senator in nearly 5 years.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how the new proposed rules would have affected ethics investigations, but it is almost certain that the net result would have been that the public would learn less about allegations of ethics violations by their elected officials.\n\nThis is also not the first — and probably not the last — attempt by lawmakers to make it harder for OCE to investigate them. Two years ago, Republicans pushed through a late-night amendment that underscored the need for OCE to protect the due process rights of accused lawmakers. It is not clear that rules change had much impact.
Aubrey Cohen\n\nNerdWallet\n\nAfter an accident, you might think it would be obvious what's wrong with your car and what repairs are necessary. But it turns out auto insurance companies and repair shops routinely disagree over repairs, and you should pay attention to such disputes.\n\nIn many cases, insurance companies do not accept a body shop's estimate of what a repair will cost, industry officials said. In other cases, the insurer will generate the original estimate, and a repair shop might disagree.\n\nIn either case, we work with shops to come to an agreed-upon price to repair the vehicle, says Thomas Hambrick, assistant vice president of media and public relations at insurance company The Hartford. The Hartford has applied for a patent on an automated system to review such estimates.\n\nMichael Barry, vice president of media relations for the industry group Insurance Information Institute, notes people can disagree on several variables, adding, In most cases these are resolved after an amicable negotiation.\n\nIt's not in an insurance company's interest to put an unsafe car back on the road, Barry says.\n\n11 States Where Drivers Can Save the Most on Car Insurance\n\nPoints of contention\n\nWhat do insurance companies and repair shops disagree about? Here are the five most common sticking points, according to insurance and auto repair officials.\n\n• Whether a part can be fixed or needs to be replaced. For instance, a garage's estimate might call for replacing a body panel, but an insurer might want the body shop to try repairing it first, says Dan Risley, president of the shop owners group Automotive Service Association.\n\n• What kind of replacement part to use. Sometimes an insurer will not pay for a part from the original manufacturer, insisting a used part or cheaper aftermarket version is good enough. Some high-end insurance policies guarantee use of original manufacturer parts.\n\n• How long repairs should take. A repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, Risley says. Each extra hour is more labor cost. And each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.\n\n• The labor rate. A garage might have a per-hour cost that's more than an insurer is willing to pay.\n\n• Whether there are errors in the estimate. An estimate might call for replacement of a part that isn't damaged or omit something that does need repair.\n\nWhere you fit in\n\nDisagreements tend to be resolved fairly quickly, Barry says. It generally goes pretty smoothly, because the auto insurers and the auto body repair shops are going to be seeing one another again frequently, he notes.\n\nBut such situations are considerably more rare for the rest of us, who might also have opinions about how our cars should be fixed. Your influence will depend on your insurance policy and state regulations. For instance, the contract might spell out what kind of parts can be used.\n\nMost states require repair shop estimates to identify where non-original parts would be used, and nine states require customer consent for use of aftermarket crash-repair parts, at least in certain cases, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nSo find out what your preferred auto shop thinks needs to be done, ask if there's any disagreement from the insurance company and make your wishes known.\n\nI think the consumer has a vested interest in seeing that the process runs smoothly and that the car is returned to a state of good repair, Barry says. It's a process that a consumer should watch closely.\n\nMORE: The States Where Drivers Can Save the Most on Car Insurance\n\nMORE: How Texting While Driving Can Affect Car Insurance Rates\n\nMORE: NerdWallet Tool: Compare Car Insurance Rates\n\nAubrey Cohen is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhy can't this administration just tell the truth about the U.S. strike on Iranian terror boss Qasem Soleimani?\n\nThe truth, after all, should be enough. Soleimani helped organize and plan attacks that killed thousands, and he helped to turn entire regions of the Middle East into a charnel house. He was an avowed enemy of the United States and its allies who was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition troops.\n\nPrevious administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with Iran were too high. The Trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him. This is a clear enough narrative that administration officials should be able to go out and tell it to Congress, the American people and the international community without shooting themselves in the foot over and over.\n\nBut no. The truth is never enough for this administration. Every moment must be a heroic thriller, an action movie starring Dona­­­ld Trump and SEAL Team Six. It is not enough to be a responsible steward of the nation's security, a role that requires patience and prudence, for which Trump is unprepared and has failed repeatedly.\n\nA Hollywood script about attacks\n\nInstead, President Trump must portray himself the way his base sees him, as a forceful avenger riding an American eagle into battle. He cannot bear to think of himself as Jimmy Carter, who agonized over risks and deliberated too long about the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, nor can he stand to think of himself as Barack Obama, the much more popular president he clearly envies, who created the terrible and defective Iran nuclear deal.\n\nNow, inquisitive members of Congress, nosy reporters, disloyal Democrats and all the other people Trump thinks of as his enemies have asked obvious questions about U.S. policy. Rather than answer them, Trump has sent his national security officials out with a Hollywood script about an imminent attack that he says involved four U.S. Embassies but refuses to explain to anyone, not even to his trusted surrogates at Fox News.\n\nThe story began to unravel as soon as it hit the street. Apparently, the threat was so severe that it was worth killing Soleimani and courting war with a country of 80 million people. It's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any U.S. Embassies that they were in peril. National security adviser Robert O'Brien dodged the question when it was asked. (Republican members of Congress might consider that such laxity was why they grilled then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for 11 hours about Benghazi, Libya, in 2015.)\n\nWorse, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that he saw no such evidence. Making the rounds of the Sunday shows, Esper said only that the president believed the attacks were possible, and that therefore he believes the president. It is inconceivable such intelligence would have been kept from Esper, and his admission that he has not seen any such thing raises justifiable suspicions that this exquisite intelligence does not exist.\n\nRoll of the dice:Trump crisis mismanagement on full display on Iran, Iraq, Soleimani\n\nEsper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. But again, it raises the baffling problem of why the Trump team didn't just make the case that Soleimani, like Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that U.S. forces finally had a clear shot at him. Why lie when the truth is compelling? Why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?\n\nThis is all reminiscent of Trump's embroidering of the killing of the leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an action that is to his credit and will be one of the few unarguably positive additions to this administration's foreign policy record. Trump couldn't leave it at a stoic and confident proclamation that the United States killed a ghastly terrorist; instead, he had to pile on ridiculous details about al-Baghdadi crying and pleading, things he could not have known and which remain unverified.\n\nSecurity for America or Trump?\n\nWith both al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, as with so many other moments with this president, Trump can't seem to stick to one coherent story. And so we end up talking not about policy, but whether there is something deeply wrong with the commander in chief and whether he can be trusted with American national security.\n\nThe more ominous problem here is that the Trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. It might well be true that any day when Soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. But Trump — like Bill Clinton ordering an airstrike on Iraq the day after the Republican House accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.\n\n52 targets:Trump threats to Iran culture sites were illegal, bad strategy and a break with tradition\n\nBy refusing to provide any details to anyone, and instead sending his briefers out to tell members of Congress, in essence, to shut up, the president looks like he is trying to cover up a strike whose purpose had more to do with the security of Donald Trump than the security of the United States.\n\nIn every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. Trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side. This deficit of character is bad enough in a single leader, but when it spreads to an entire administration, it is dangerous to national security and destructive to trust in democracy.\n\nTom Nichols is a national security professor at the Naval War College, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.

Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThis new year brings brings fresh choices and fresh controversies in health care. President Trump and Republicans tried last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act and, when that failed, to chip away at the law in other ways. But in the end, with no legislation passed, the principal result was to galvanize a once ambivalent public.\n\nNow we enter 2018 with health care as a top concern of American voters and the ACA as popular as ever. More importantly, Americans recognize the ACA's flaws and by large margins just want them to be fixed.\n\nMore:Tax bill is just another way to repeal health care. Will coverage ever be safe?\n\nMore:Republican tax law is not a win. Take it from me, the backlash is coming.\n\nThere is plenty about the ACA that isn't working as well as it could. Seven years of no improvements and the peeling away of key elements will do that to any law.\n\nSerious proposals from both sides should be listened to. Republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. Democrats want to address drug costs. But instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting Medicaid and the ACA to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.\n\nSubstantive policy debates won't be any more likely in an election year like this one. But in four critical areas there are decisions ahead that will have major ramifications for millions of Americans — and potentially for what happens in November, when control of Congress is at stake.\n\nMedicaid cuts: Republicans failed in their attempts to cut health spending last year in various repeal bills, but that didn't stop them from going ahead with the sizable tax cuts the repeal was intended to fund. That created a $1 trillion-plus IOU. Now House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to pay it off — arguing that with less revenue coming in, it's even more important to cut spending on Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nBut there's less appetite for deep Medicaid cuts in the Senate and even less in the electorate. If Ryan is serious about reforming Medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. I partnered with a Republican from the first Bush administration, Gail Wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. It would be a smart move now.\n\nACA repeal: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. still burns a candle for repealing and replacing the ACA. He and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., last year proposed a system of block grants to states, with fewer strings attached to the money and fewer protections for sicker or older people.It didn't have the support to pass then.Should Congress take it up again, it will be sure to aggravate a very active and alert public in an election year. Perhaps more to the point, the Republican majority in the Senate is narrower than last year, and moderates and many conservatives aren't excited to live through the last year again.\n\nACA fixes: If there's a way for Trump and the Republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the ACA in 2017. The administration stopped paying Cost-Sharing Reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.\n\nMore:It's now or never for Paul Ryan and his quest to remake America's safety net\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nCongress should pass a permanent program allowing insurance companies to buy reinsurance to offset the risk of their most expensive cases. That would reverse some of that damage and decrease rates across the country, according to an analysis by Oliver Wyman. This would be a smart political move as these premium decreases would come out right before the election. You can imagine Trump's tweets on how he's fixed things. No matter that he would be only partially fixing what he just broke.\n\nTrump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.\n\nHow Republicans decide to handle the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of the 2018 budget process this month will set a clear tone for the year. Not renewing this program serving 9 million children was one of their biggest blunders of 2017. Now they have a chance to pass a long-term renewal without any of last year's poison pills in the form of House proposals to cut Medicare and ACA coverage.\n\nThe action starts immediately and triggers a series of important choices. The overall path that helps the most Americans is, as it usually is, also the path that makes the most political sense.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

Kim Komando\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ. I keep seeing posts on Facebook about Mark Zuckerberg giving away money. Is this true?\n\nA. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did announce after the birth of their daughter that they would be giving away 99% of their Facebook shares. However, the couple said nothing as to when, or how, these shares would be handed out. This opened the door for online hoaxes, and there have been several going around. Such as one that claims you could get $10 million just for sharing or liking, and another that has people posting a magical unicorn. If you see them, it's best not to click, like or share. You know what they say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nNeighborhood safety\n\nQ. My family is relocating to a new city. I'm unfamiliar with the area, and am concerned about crime. How can I see my new neighborhood?\n\nA. The website My Local Crime is a great resource for anyone who is thinking of moving into a new neighborhood. It allows you to enter an address and see what crimes have been committed recently in the area. You also can listen to police scanners anywhere in the nation using free software called Police Radio Scanner. Keep in mind, every city will have its fair share of crime, but research will at least give you some insights into what's going on.\n\nWindows 10 privacy settings\n\nQ. I've heard rumors that Microsoft collects information about what I do online. Is that true, and what can I do about it?\n\nA. If you use Windows 10, then the answer probably is yes. Many consumers are worried about some of the details in the Windows 10 privacy policy, which allows Microsoft to collect a lot of information about you and your online activity. Naturally, Microsoft claims this information is used only to make improvements to their products' functionality, but this tactic still doesn't sit well with many. What's worse is that the steps to update your privacy settings are confusing and tedious.\n\nUsing Twitter for a small business\n\nQ. I run a small business, and everyone says I need to set up a Twitter account. Is that really necessary?\n\nA. Social media has truly transformed the way customers interact with companies, and it can be a valuable marketing tool for any business. Most companies benefit from having well-managed Facebook and Twitter accounts, but you need to know how to use them. Posting too much or too little can hurt you. The best tip is to use each platform for a specific purpose that benefits your business. For example, use Facebook to share events, photos and customer testimonials, then use Twitter to share coupon codes, news and special discounts.\n\nComputer security\n\nQ. I received a new laptop for Christmas. What should I do to make sure my browsing is secure?\n\nA. One of the first things every new computer should have is a good anti-virus. But, beyond that, there is one critical computer setting that can really keep your computer more secure. It has to do with Adobe Flash. Since Flash is so widely used, it's also a prime target for hackers who are looking to hide malware. If Flash can run ads and videos automatically, you may pick up a virus without intending to.\n\nSlow Internet\n\nQ. I've noticed that sometimes my Internet seems slower than other times. What causes this?\n\nA. It could just be your Internet connection acting up ... or someone could be stealing your line, sucking up valuable bandwidth. Luckily, you can check to see what devices are connected to your network. And, if you do find unauthorized devices, there are steps you can take to ensure they won't return.\n\nOn the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAs liquidation looms for Sears and Kmart, many consumers are wondering if there will be any liquidation sales. And if so, will they be any good?\n\nThis has happened before, like when Toys R Us went out of business in late 2018 and had liquidation sales.\n\nWhile you might expect steep discounts on popular items before a company closes its doors for the last time, that may not be the case. Depending on how a store gets rid of leftover merchandise, you could actually end up paying more than what the same items cost at a competing retailer.\n\nHere's how to shop at a going out of business sale without getting fleeced.\n\nKnow who you're buying from\n\nCredit: Getty Images Big stores often sell their wares to a professional liquidator.\n\nIf a retailer is only closing a few locations, don't expect to find the best merchandise sitting around in a store that's soon to be shuttered. Chances are it will have been moved to a location that's staying open, where it might have a better chance of selling.\n\nThings are different if the entire chain is folding, however, and shoppers should be aware of the difference.\n\nLiquidation sales are very different from regular, ordinary sales going on in the store, said Dr. Tony Gao, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Massachusetts Lowell's Manning School of Business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat's because most major retailers use professional liquidation companies to move merchandise. These liquidators—like Great American and Tiger Direct, who handled HH Gregg's liquidation—often buy remaining merchandise outright. So even if the retailer's name is still on the front of the store, you're buying that new camera or laptop from a liquidator.\n\nAs a result, the store's ordinary return policy may not apply, or coupons may not be valid. Make sure to read the fine print before you buy.\n\nDon't get psyched out\n\nCredit: Getty Images These signs are down to a science.\n\nEven those red-and-white signs that proclaim, EVERYTHING MUST GO! are there for a reason. Liquidators have done thousands of going out of business sales, and they know what works.\n\nThey understand the consumer's buying psychology, and they know when to start the sales, how long they'll last, and they'll also move around inventory from store to store, Gao said. They operate on the assumption that consumers are attracted by liquidation sales.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, it's not uncommon for liquidators to warehouse merchandise from closed retailers, and move it to wherever they think it might sell. Anything left behind goes back in the warehouse until it's time to liquidate another retailer—which is why you might see discount furniture at an electronics store, or outdated fashions at a clothing store.\n\nLiquidation companies do that—they have patience, said Gao. Many of them have more patience than the retailers being closed themselves.\n\nTo avoid getting sucked in, ask yourself if you actually need what's going on sale. If you do, check prices from other retailers on your phone to make sure you're getting a good deal.\n\nShop small and save\n\nCredit: Getty Images Smaller retailers sometimes offer better deals.\n\nAlthough major retailers tend to rely on liquidators to empty stock, shoppers can still sometimes find deals when smaller stores or specialty retailers go out of business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores, said Bob Nelson of Power Retail, a Phoenix, AZ-based liquidation consultant.\n\nMany of the smaller customers Nelson works with are shutting down due to an illness or retirement. They've often been fixtures in a community, and want to maximize the value of their inventory without upsetting loyal customers.\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores.\n\nThe smart ones want to get out of there clean. It's only the desperate ones that would sell it to a liquidator, he said. Working with the smaller retailers, we always tell them they have to keep their integrity.\n\nAccording to Nelson, some of the best deals can come from specialty stores that carry unique merchandise—like high-end clothing. In that case, he said, you want to get there early, not late, because late everything's picked over.
Anti-mask protests and videos of altercations over face mask requirements at businesses across the country continue to go viral even as coronavirus cases surge.\n\nOn Saturday, Burn the Mask protesters blocked the entrance of a Fresno, California, Trader Joe's, causing the grocer to close in the afternoon, the Fresno Bee reported.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, where nearly 1 in 5 people are testing positive, a group of protestors stormed a Ralphs grocery store Sunday, argued with customers over masks with one protester calling a fellow shopper a mask Nazi, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nMeanwhile, outside a Houston café, protesters waved American flags over the weekend after some customers were upset over having to wear face masks. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner tweeted in response and support of the restaurant, saying he heard Miller's Cafe has pretty good burgers. I will patronize them Monday and I hope you patronize them this week.\n\nNew Starbucks menu:Starbucks releases winter menu with new Pistachio Latte, Honey Almondmilk Cold Brew, Red Velvet Loaf and more\n\nA way to help meet New Year's resolutions? Chipotle launches Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice, four new lifestyle bowls in time for New Year's resolutions\n\nAnd at an H&M in Hanover, Maryland, on Friday, a shopper recorded another shopper refusing to put on her mask and their disagreement. An employee also asked the unidentified shopper to wear a mask.\n\nYou don't care about people? You want people to die? People are dying of COVID, said Ronald Harper in the video he recorded at the Arundel Mills Mall store, WBAL-TV 11 News, an NBC affiliate, reported.\n\nMask compliance has sparked debates throughout the pandemic after Americans received mixed messages from authorities early on over whether they should wear face coverings in public places.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said for months that wearing masks slows the spread of COVID-19, but meanwhile, some politicians, including President Donald Trump, have been called out for not wearing one. As the nation edged further into the stay-at-home era, viral videos of conflicts over mask requirements at businesses have become common to see.\n\nA flurry of videos started in late June as more stores started asking shoppers to adhere to mask policies. Many of the viral disagreements have happened in cities and states already mandating masks.\n\nOften, law enforcement is called to help, but the CDC has advised retailers to not argue with shoppers over masks.\n\nTrader Joe's closed Fresno store early\n\nTrader Joe's has been asking shoppers to wear masks for months, and California started requiring masks or face coverings be worn inside businesses statewide back on June 18. Several parts of the state required masks before then.\n\nIn late June, a woman without a mask at another California Trader Joe's called employees and shoppers Democratic pigs and screamed profanities because she said she felt threatened when a fellow customer cursed her out for not wearing a mask.\n\nRegarding the incident at the Fresno store, Kenya Friend-Daniel, Trader Joe's national director of public relations, told USA TODAY that safety and well-being of its staff and customers is, and always has been, our top priority.\n\nAs such, since the pandemic was declared, Trader Joe's has prioritized creating a safe working and shopping environment every day, developing effective procedures that meet or exceed CDC guidelines, inclusive of mask requirements, Friend-Daniel said in a statement Monday, adding the company will continue to do the right thing ... with all of our decisions focused on putting their health and safety first.\n\nOn its website, the grocer says it requires customers wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores. Unless otherwise directed by local rule or law, this does not apply to young children and those with medical conditions who are not able to wear face coverings.\n\nHowever, for California, during current regional stay home order, Trader Joe's says all customers are required to wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores, without exceptions.\n\nDr. David Abrams, professor of social and behavioral science at New York University, told USA TODAY in October after Trump got COVID-19 that there should be consequences for not wearing masks when required like seat belt rules and needing a shirt and shoes to enter a business.\n\nRetail stores have every right to say if you are not wearing a mask please leave, he said. This is a life-and-death issue. Masks, physical distance and hand-washing are the three things we have to reduce the spread of the virus in the absence of a vaccine.\n\nMask wearing seen as a political issue\n\nAround mid-July, the nation's largest retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Target announced mask requirements would be implemented until further notice at all stores throughout the country.\n\nYet, even though signs are posted at store entrances, there isn't always compliance and there have been confrontations with maskless shoppers.\n\nBoth the Retail Industry Leaders Association and National Retail Federation have encouraged mask policies to protect shoppers and employees.\n\nRetailers are alarmed with the instances of hostility and violence front-line employees are experiencing by a vocal minority of customers who are under the misguided impression that wearing a mask is a violation of their civil liberties, Brian Dodge, the retail association's president, said in a July letter to the National Governors Association.\n\nRecent surveys show more consumers are complying with retailer and local mandates, but that it is often seen as a political issue.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found in a recent poll that 87% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans say they are wearing a mask every time they leave the house and are around other people.\n\nA recent Ipsos poll had similar results with 74% of Americans agreeing that masks are an effective tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but that 90% of Democrats agree with the statement versus 61% of Republicans.\n\nMollyann Brodie, executive director of the foundation's Public Opinion and Survey Research Program, said the difference is part of partisan beliefs about whether masks are protective and necessary.\n\nI think that's what we are seeing in these continued protests is that belief that was set in stone very early on in the course of the pandemic, Brodie said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he plans to ask all Americans to wear masks during the first 100 days of his administration.\n\nBiden said that where he has authority, he will issue an order mandating that masks be worn in places like federal buildings, airplanes, and interstate transportation like buses.\n\nBrodie thinks the results of Biden's plan could be mixed.\n\nMany people will be happy to see that type of leadership on taking public health precautions and trying to help limit the spread and certainly the surge we're seeing in the coronavirus, Brodie said. But some people and particularly those who are more likely to be Republicans will react negatively to such a call.\n\nIf you're planning to shop, know the answers to these FAQs:\n\nCan stores and restaurants require masks?\n\nYes. Local governments can decide what safety measures to impose on businesses, but individual businesses can institute further restrictions. Many governors instituted or renewed orders requiring people to wear face coverings in public. Most of the orders require people to wear masks in both indoor and outdoor public spaces where social distancing isn't possible, but some apply to only specific places or age groups.\n\nShould kids wear masks?\n\nAccording to the CDC, cloth face coverings should not be worn by children younger than 2. Older children can and should wear masks, experts say. Schools across the nation are requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible.\n\nAre people with disabilities required to wear masks?\n\nAccording to the Southeast ADA Center in Atlanta, which provides training and guidance on access, if a person with a disability is not able to wear a face mask, state and local government agencies and private businesses must consider reasonable modifications to a face mask policy so that the person with the disability can participate in, or benefit from, the programs offered or goods and services that are provided.\n\nWhen should masks be worn and what kind?\n\nThe CDC recommends wearing masks in public settings around people who don't live in your household and when you can't stay 6 feet away from others to help stop the spread of COVID-19 to others.\n\nThe agency's mask recommendations for types of face coverings include:\n\nWear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWear the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin\n\nMasks should be worn by people 2 years and older\n\nMasks should not be worn by children younger than 2, people who have trouble breathing, or people who cannot remove the mask without assistance\n\nThe CDC does not recommend the use of gaiters or face shields and says evaluation of these face covers is on-going but effectiveness is unknown at this time.\n\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann, USA TODAY\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko
Abu Muhammad al-Masri, the No. 2 leader of al-Qaeda was killed in Iran last summer, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Tuesday, though he did not say if the U.S. ordered his assassination or had a role in carrying it out.\n\nToday, I can confirm for the first time his death on August 7th of last year, Pompeo said in remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that al-Masri was gunned down in Tehran by Israeli agents at the behest of the United States. He was on the FBI's Most Wanted List for his role in the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which left more than 200 people deal, including 12 Americans.\n\nPompeo confirmed al-Masri's death in a broader speech that cast Iran as the new home base for al-Qaeda – without offering direct new evidence.\n\nIran is indeed the new Afghanistan, as the key geographic hub for al-Qaeda, Pompeo said. They're partners in terrorism, partners in hate. This axis poses a grave threat to the security of nations and to the American homeland itself.\n\nHis provocative remarks come just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office with promises to revive U.S.-Iran diplomacy, including the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program, which the Trump administration withdrew from in 2018.\n\nPompeo, an Iran hawk, has made it clear he opposes Biden's plans to return to nuclear negotiations with Iran. Although he did not mention Biden by name on Tuesday, he denounced the appeasement of Tehran as naive.\n\nLet's not lie to the American people about Iranian moderation and pretend the appeasement will work, he said.\n\nPompeo said Iran's ministry of intelligence and security and other agencies have provided safe havens and logistical support, such as ID cards and passports, that enable al-Qaeda activity. As a result of this assistance, al-Qaeda has centralized its leadership inside Tehran, he said.\n\nIran experts cast doubt on Pompeo's allegations.\n\nIt's just not believable at this point, said Trita Parsi, an Iran expert and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington, D.C. think tank. This is an administration that is doing everything it can to create conflict inside of the U.S., and now it's doing everything it can to make sure that no diplomacy can take place between the U.S. and Iran after it leaves.\n\nParsi said Pompeo's claims amounted to complete nonsense and questioned why he waited until the waning days of the Trump administration to announce such potentially explosive allegations.\n\nAlireza Miryousefi, an Iranian diplomat attached to Tehran's mission to the United Nations in New York, described the State Department's claims as preposterous, false and nothing new.\n\nIran has long maintained that al-Qaeda's chief backers in the Middle East are countries with whom the U.S. has good relations, such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nMax Abrahms, a terrorism expert and professor at Northeastern University, noted that al-Qaeda is first and foremost associated with Saudi Arabia, not Iran. The Trump administration has forged extremely close ties with the Saudi kingdom and made isolating Iran a cornerstone of its foreign policy agenda over the last four years.\n\nIn a tweet after Pompeo's speech, Abrahms said it's true that Iran has had some shady ties with Al Qaeda. We have know this for many, many years.\n\nBut, he added, if you're looking to Iran rather than Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar & Pakistan to understand state sponsorship of Al Qaeda then you have been duped and lost the plot.\n\nBarbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, also questioned Pompeo's motives in making Tuesday's speech.\n\nIt's just more of an effort to justify a failed policy toward Iran under the Trump administration. What more mud can they possibly throw? Slavin said. Iran has had a relationship with al Qaeda for a long time. If that relationship has gotten closer, then Mike Pompeo should just look in the mirror.
AP\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — After winning their last two games in overtime, the Columbus Blue Jackets went up by three goals in the third period Sunday night against the New York Rangers and appeared ready to hit cruise control.\n\nIt wasn't going to be that easy, though.\n\nThe New York Rangers scored two quick goals later in the third to turn a rout into a tight game down the stretch. It wasn't until Nick Foligno scored a wrap-around goal with 1:21 left that Columbus had some breathing room on the way to 7-5 victory.\n\nFoligno scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky returned from a team suspension to stop 22 shots for the Blue Jackets, who have won four of the last five and jumped Pittsburgh to move into second place behind Washington in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nIt's a weird game when you're up 6-3 and they're pushing and pressing and get some flukey ones, Foligno said. But we stuck with it and did the right things and found a way to get the job done. That's what you have to do — you don't care how it gets done, just get those two points.\n\nCam Atkinson and Artemi Panarin each had a goal and an assist, Ryan Murray had two assists and nine other Blue Jackets picked up points in the offensive explosion. Columbus had 19 shots in the first period and outshot the Rangers 40-27 for the game.\n\nWe had the puck all night long, Columbus coach John Tortorella said.\n\nMats Zuccarello had two goals, and Ryan Stome, Chris Kreider and Jimmy Vesey also scored for New York, which has lost six of the last seven and is languishing near the bottom of the Metro.\n\nAlexandar Georgiev, spelling regular starter Henrik Lungqvist on the second night of a back-to-back, had 33 saves.\n\nRangers coach David Quinn channeled the salty Tortorella in his postgame comments, referring to his team's effort as a freakin' joke. The Rangers, he said, lacked what he called a bit of a snarl.\n\n(Columbus is) a team that competes hard on pucks and tests your mettle, and we failed miserably tonight, Quinn said. Miserably. Our lack of determination on one-on-one battles, fishing for pucks. You do that in this league, that's what happens ... .\n\nAnthony Duclair, Lukas Sedlak and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets. Bobrovsky — who had been benched for Thursday's game for violating a team policy and didn't play in Saturday's overtime win over Washington — wasn't terrific, but held off the Rangers after they pulled the goalie for a sixth skater late in the game.\n\nThe team didn't release details of what happened with the two-time Vezina Trophy winner, but Bobrovsky acknowledged he let his emotions run away him. He said he spoke to the team and cleared the air.\n\nWe'll move ahead, said Bobrovsky, who hasn't been able to come to terms with the team on a contract extension and may be traded. I'll get back to work and do my thing, try to do my best to help this team win.\n\nNOTES: Columbus' 19 shots in the first were the most in a period for the team this season. ... Blue Jackets D Zach Werenski played in his 200th NHL game. He had the assist on Atkinson's second-period goal. ... Rick Nash, who was the first star of the Columbus franchise, did the ceremonial puck drop. The 34-year-old Nash retired because of concussion issues after 15 seasons. ...

Jason Margolis\n\nPRI's The World\n\nAfter you collect your cans, bottles and paper, then put them out by the curb, do you ever think about where everything goes after the truck picks things up? Largely, it goes to China.\n\nEvery day, nearly 4,000 shipping containers full of recyclables leave U.S. ports bound for China. China sends the U.S. toys, clothes and electronics; in return, some of America's largest exports back are paper, plastic and aluminum.\n\nBut that equation is changing as of Jan. 1 — China is enforcing its new National Sword policy, which bans 24 types of solid waste, including various plastics and unsorted mixed papers, and sets a much tougher standard for contamination levels.\n\nChina notified the World Trade Organization about the ban in July, essentially saying the country would no longer act as the world's trash dump. Currently, China consumes 55% of the world's scrap paper and is a major destination for other recyclables.\n\nThe National Sword policy follows China's Green Fence, a 10-month policy the country enacted five years ago, which set initial standards for lower contamination levels for recycling.\n\nThe ban will undoubtedly hurt recycling operators in China that rely on the import of raw materials. But delivering a cleaner China is paramount for Communist Party politicians.\n\nThe National Sword is also already being felt throughout the U.S. About a 45-minute drive west of Boston in the city of Westborough, Massachusetts, bales of paper are stacking up in a parking lot.\n\nWe're looking at 150 to 200 tractor trailer loads of paper. It's stacked approximately 12 feet high, and it goes for quite a distance, says Ben Harvey, president of E.L. Harvey & Sons, a family-run business since 1911.\n\nTo be clear: This situation is not normal.\n\nNo, our business is to bring it in, process it and move it out as quickly as we can, says Harvey.\n\nHarvey can't sell the 2,000-pound bales to China because the contamination levels — the trash that's accidentally mixed in, something like the remnants of a greasy pizza box that gets thrown in with the recycling — almost certainly exceed China's rigorous new standards. If he had continued putting bales on ships a few weeks ago, they wouldn't have reached China until the ban would've already been in effect on Jan. 1.\n\nHarvey is hoping that China and the U.S. can work out a deal or he can find other processing mills in Vietnam or Thailand. Selling the material in the U.S. simply isn't an option.\n\nBecause everything was going offshore, the mills have been slow to develop in the United States to handle this material, Harvey says. With the tightness in the marketplace, there might be mills that will be built, but that takes four to five to six years to put in a mill that will handle the capacity that we're currently looking at.\n\nIn the meantime, he's growing increasingly concerned as the bales of paper take over more and more of his parking lot.\n\nIf this stuff doesn't move, and we don't know what to do with it, we can't keep it forever, he says. At some point, it's going to start to degrade. The other thing that could happen is that if we can't find outlets — and I'm not talking about just E.L. Harvey & Sons, I'm talking about the industry as a whole — we're going to stop bringing material into our facilities. And that's going to impact recycling programs throughout the country.\n\nIn other words, trucks could stop collecting our curbside recycling.\n\nThis is not a little disruption, says Susan Collins, president of the Container Recycling Institute, a research organization based in Southern California. This is a big disruption to a bigger industry than most people would think it is, because it's sort of an invisible process. You put your stuff out at the curb, and it goes away — nobody thinks about it as being a multibillion industry in this country.\n\nCollins says China's crackdown presents something between a challenge and a crisis for U.S. recyclers.\n\nWe've already put things on ships that may be coming back, says Collins. The U.S. recycling industry has asked for some relaxation of the rules, but there are ongoing negotiations right now in the hopes of making this not quite as drastic a move.\n\nCollins says U.S. recyclers are willing to adjust, but they need time.\n\nChina has already relaxed the rules in the past few months, shifting acceptable fiber contamination rates from 0.3% to 0.5%, still a near impossible standard for U.S. recyclers.\n\nBen Harvey says he can't come anywhere close to that. That's largely because American consumers are making it hard on recycling collectors.\n\nInside his plant, streams of cans, bottles and paper roll by on conveyor belts. A machine sorts things first, then workers do a second, manual sort — they pick out a lot of trash from the bottles and cans. About 15% of the recycling that E.L. Harvey & Sons collects in its recycling trucks is unusable rubbish.\n\nMore:Trump's dangerous America First path: This is how empires crumble\n\nMore:China: U.S. should curb demand for opioids, not blame us\n\nMore:China hits back at Trump tweet accusing it of selling oil to North Korea\n\nWe call it 'wishful recycling,' Harvey says. The general public says, 'Hey, let's put it in (the) recycling barrel; they'll figure out something to do with it.'\n\nHarvey says through sorting, he can get contamination levels down to between 1% and 2%, but no further, unless better machinery is developed and/or he can expand the line of workers doing manual sorting. But that's a risky proposition for a business that relies on thin margins and volatile commodity prices.\n\nHarvey estimates that he can continue storing bales of paper in his parking lot for another three to six months. If a solution isn't found by then, it could mean shuttering the processing facility and layoffs, perhaps getting rid of 50 people.\n\nAnd that could also translate into more bottles, cans and paper being sent straight to the landfill.\n\nThis article was originally posted on PRI.org.

AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — A new generation of young, talented and, above all, clean Russian athletes will compete at next month's Pyeongchang Olympics, according to Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko.\n\nThe Russians must compete under the Olympic flag in South Korea after the International Olympic Committee ruled the country operated a sophisticated doping and cover-up program when it hosted the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nMutko — who was sports minister at the time — has been banned from the Olympics for life along with 43 athletes, though he and all but one of the athletes have filed appeals.\n\nThose bans, which include 14 medalists, have helped clear the way for younger talent in Russia, Mutko said. While there would usually be about 40 percent changeover in the Russian team between Olympics, he said, this time 80 percent of athletes will not have competed in Sochi.\n\nIn practically every event it's an absolutely new, young team, Mutko said in an interview Saturday in a VIP box at the European figure skating championships in Moscow.\n\nAlthough Mutko is no longer sports minister, he is still in overall charge of sports policy and the government's preparations for soccer's World Cup.\n\nDespite the Olympic bans, Russian officials expect about 200 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, though not all would have normally been the country's first choice. That's fewer than in Sochi in 2014, but more than in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nIt's not yet clear which Russians will go to the Olympics — where they will compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia because the country's team is formally banned. The IOC is vetting lists of athletes submitted by Russian officials before issuing invitations.\n\nIn every sport we have a lot of interesting young athletes with potential and we hope they can realize their potential, Mutko said. We'd like them to compete in equal conditions. We're trying to abstract them from all these political scandals, though it's extremely difficult because we see the date on the calendar and it's not clear if (a particular athlete) is going to the Olympics or not, because each of them needs to receive an invitation.\n\nMutko said Russia's young stars who could break through in Pyeongchang include 15-year-old European figure skating champion Alina Zagitova, ski jumper Sofia Tikhonova and speedskater Pavel Kulizhnikov.\n\nSo far, the IOC says it has cut a preliminary list of 500 down to 389, but hasn't revealed names.\n\nIt's likely that any decision will be followed by a rush of last-minute appeals by athletes who aren't invited, particularly because the IOC wants to exclude all Russians with previous doping offenses — potentially including Kulizhnikov — not just the 43 banned from Sochi. Mutko said that condition had been added absolutely illegally.\n\nHe said the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is hearing various Russian appeals, was biased toward the Olympic officials and the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nIt's basically tame for the IOC and WADA. It's tame, he said, adding that Russia still rejected the findings of IOC and WADA investigations which detailed widespread doping. Why does everyone tell us to accept the report? We won't accept any report.\n\nThe Russian government insists it never supported dopers or covered up for them. Mutko painted WADA's star witness, former Moscow and Sochi laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov, as untrustworthy and erratic, and said the Russian government wasn't responsible for any malpractice in the state-funded Sochi drug-testing lab during the Olympics. Instead, he laid the blame at the feet of the IOC and WADA.\n\nI look at the ruling on myself and ... I don't understand it. I'm being accused of being a minister who did not ensure quality anti-doping at the Olympics. But I wasn't supposed to do that. It's their work, understand? Mutko said, blaming WADA. They didn't control a damn thing — excuse me — and what, should we answer for that?\n\nAhead of last month's IOC decision to force Russians to compete under a neutral flag, some officials said that option would not be acceptable. However, no boycotts ... were ever considered, Mutko said Saturday.\n\nRussian athletes are appealing against certain conditions of eligibility, but no appeal has been filed by Russia against the central point of the IOC sanctions, banning the Russian team from competing with its own flag and anthem. Mutko said that was because he believed the Court of Arbitration for Sport would dismiss any appeal.\n\nMutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. However, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the Russian Football Union and chairman of the organizing committee for the World Cup.\n\nMutko said he continues to have a key role overseeing the government's multi-billion-dollar investments in World Cup stadiums and infrastructure. Leaving the organizing committee, he said, was simply not to give any extra reason for criticism of Russia from abroad.\n\nIn the government now, the president and prime minister, they've decided that I will continue to do all of this and finish this project, Mutko said. So we're doing it and everything will be at a high organizational level. I'm absolutely sure.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff's death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an aggressive manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson's black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: One of the longest-serving members on the state Supreme Court plans to retire later this year. The Alaska Judicial Council is accepting applications for the seat held by Justice Craig Stowers, who plans to retire effective June 1, according to Mara Rabinowitz with the state court system. Stowers, a former Superior Court judge, was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009 and later served as a chief justice. Of the current justices, only Daniel Winfree has served on the Supreme Court longer. Winfree was appointed in 2007. The judicial council plans to meet in May to interview applicants. The names of finalists advanced by the council will be sent to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will make the appointment.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global's Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That's why I'm so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting, Haskell said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase Deus Vult, a Latin expression meaning God wills it, in red letters across the Newark building's exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney's release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The viral art phenomenon known as Infinity Mirrors is returning to the Hirshhorn Museum on April 4. The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama's work, One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection, will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two Infinity Mirror rooms, including Kusama's 1965 installation Phalli's Field and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture Flower Overcoat will also be part of One with Eternity. The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including The Geography of Home, released in 2018. He's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed The Ropewalk Writers' Retreat in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.\n\nMichigan\n\nMidland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWinona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year's Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena'l, based in Winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in North America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor's stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney's Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college's existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward, said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn't undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove's campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men's resource center, police said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets for the chance to win the right to destroy the village. Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year's raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More people earned bachelor's degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor's degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor's degrees.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Monday swore in a new chief justice, as well as its first-ever Native American justice. The Spokesman-Review reports Justice Debra Stephens became the court's 57th chief justice. A former Appeals Court judge and adjunct professor of law at Gonzaga University, she called it the greatest privilege I can imagine. Raquel Montoya-Lewis, a former Whatcom County Superior Court judge who is a member of the Pueblo Iselta tribe of New Mexico, was sworn in at the same ceremony. Montoya-Lewis is the first Native American to serve on Washington's highest court and only the second to serve on any state supreme court in the nation. Stephens called it a historic day. Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday was a day when a daughter of Spokane ascends to chief justice, and the court gets Lewis-Montoya, a judicial superstar who is a good listener, decisive, caring and compassionate.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
In between helping the Los Angeles Lakers win an NBA championship. LeBron James spent his energy on the NBA's quarantined campus speaking out on systemic racism.\n\nSo imagine James' feelings when Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced that no charges would be filed against the police officer that shot Jacob Blake, a Black person who was then left paralyzed.\n\nTo hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, James said following the Lakers' 94-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Not only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long. Not only in the Black community, but in the white community as well who see moments like this happen.\n\nThe NBA restarted the season last summer partly to salvage its television revenue during the pandemic and partly to use that platform to address systemic racism. Then, players and coaches routinely spoke out against recent cases of police officers killing unarmed Black people, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Teams and players also launched varying voting and community programs aimed to reduce racial inequality.\n\nIt sucks. We as a community tried to support the family and do everything we can to get justice for him, Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. For that to happen, it sucks for us. It feels like we let the family down.\n\nFor James, he took on a heightened role both because of his star power and his initiatives. He also launched More Than A Vote, an organization that reduces voting suppression and increased voting turnout in the Black community.\n\nIt's a blow to our community once again, James said. We've been here before. It sucks. We feel sorry for his family and that community itself. We want better. We believe we can get that.\n\nPICTURE PERFECT:Becky Hammon's historic moment as Spurs coach captured with great photo\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\n\nThe NBA's players believed the same thing after the Milwaukee Bucks walked out on their scheduled playoff game against the Orlando Magic after video showed police officers shooting Blake seven times in front of his family. The Bucks had conference calls with local politicians in hopes to enact police reforms. Following a passionate discussion among players about whether they should resume or cancel the rest of the season, James spoke with President Barack Obama, who urged them to keep its platform intact.\n\nThen, the National Basketball Players Association received more commitments from the NBA. They pledged to have each teams' arena or practice facility open as a voting site before and on Election Day, a commitment 23 out of 30 NBA teams fulfilled. The NBA's Board of Governors and NBPA also formed the NBA Foundation with an initial $300 million contribution dedicated to creating greater economic empowerment in the Black community. Teams have pledged to donate $30 million each year to the foundation for the next 10 years.\n\nNo wonder Lakers forward Wesley Matthews considered Tuesday's ruling to be truly disheartening, especially with all the work everybody had put in.\n\nWe can't lose our heads. We can't start rioting. We have to be calculated. We have to continue to keep our foot on the gas, said Matthews, who played with the Bucks last season when they staged the walkout. The flame is already lit. It just has to continue to keep burning and burning the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked; not where we're damaging anything so that all the media attention can go to look at what is happening over here. Look at the facts and let's address the issues head on.\n\nStill, the NBA and NBPA tried to address these issues already.\n\nThe NBA and NBPA formed a social justice coalition consisting of players, coaches and owners to promote civic engagement and advocate for police and criminal justice reform. The NBPA also hoped teams could leverage relationships with local and state officials with passing legislation aimed at these issues.\n\nI'm sure and am very confident that (owner) Marc Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks are doing their due diligence right now, especially with it happening in their own backyard, Matthews said. I'm very confident in that. It really is just tough. It really is disheartening. But leaders have to be leaders. Everybody has to take ownership in their own community. It can't just be those that have the platform. It's got to be everybody.\n\nThe Bucks released a statement on Tuesday, saying, the organization remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement. Graveley defended the police officers' reaction, saying it was incontrovertible that Blake was armed with a razor blade-type knife when he was shot seven times.\n\nReoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the Black community must stop, the Bucks' statement read. We will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist. As an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for African Americans and all marginalized members of our community.\n\nJames vowed to remain just as committed.\n\nMore than a Vote partnered with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to recruit 40,000 poll workers and helped register Florida voters with felony records so long as they were unrelated to murder or sexual assault. It also oversaw voting turnout initiatives for the Georgia runoff elections held on Tuesday. And James added, we're not going to stop; we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow not only in my community, but all over the world.\n\nThe best thing we were able to do in the bubble is we were able to stand together in strength and numbers with everything that was going on in America and everything that was going wrong in America, James said. We were able to voice those opinions and voice those facts every single day. I hope to continue that now being outside the bubble.\n\nMathews said the Lakers did not have a formal discussion about Tuesday's ruling before their game. But after speaking for only 84 seconds about the Lakers' win over the Grizzlies, James spoke for seven minutes about various social justice causes. James plans to speak out more regardless of any backlash he receives and any frustrated feelings he has regarding Tuesday's ruling.\n\nIt's unfortunate we have some people out there that would rather see hate than love, James said.

Roughly 80% of all Latinos living in the USA are American citizens, but media coverage of Hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how Latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns. Hecho en USA tells the stories of the nation's 59.9 million Latinos – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are born in the USA.\n\nLOS ANGELES – Preschool teacher Rosa Ramirez has a special way of asking her students to line up for playtime outside.\n\nPueden pararse si llevan puesto algo de color amarillo, como una abeja, she tells them.\n\nIn English, Ramirez would say, You can stand up if you are wearing yellow – like a bee. But this is the half of the school day in which she teaches exclusively in Spanish.\n\nHer students are not confused by her language choice. Most of the 4-year-olds wearing even a smidgen of yellow stand up as instructed.\n\nBilingual education programs can help children from all backgrounds become better students Research shows that dual-language programs where children learn both Spanish and English are especially helpful for Latino English-language learners. Editors note: Video has been updated to remove a student who opted out of appearing in photos and video. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nThe preschool dual-language program at Gates Street Early Education Center in Lincoln Heights, one of Los Angeles' oldest neighborhoods with dense populations of Latino and Asian residents, is part of a growing number of bilingual education models taking root in California and across the country. Many of them are designed to serve students from Spanish-speaking families, as well as students from other cultures, under mounting evidence that learning two languages can help people from all backgrounds become stronger students.\n\nRoughly 3.8 million students in U.S. schools are native Spanish-speakers who are not proficient in English. They make up the bulk of the approximately 5 million students nationwide identified as English language learners, the fastest-growing demographic in schools – and the lowest-performing, as judged by achievement tests and graduation rates.\n\nSixty-seven percent of students with limited English skills graduated high school after four years in 2016, compared with 84% of all students, according to federal data.\n\nLanguage experts recommend how to improve those outcomes: More high-quality, long-term dual-language programs can close the achievement gap in literacy between English learners and native English speakers after five to six years, according to research.\n\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition If we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime. Quote icon\n\nThe programs can be tough to implement. Hurdles include a debate over the best way to teach English learners, public hostility against those who speak a native language other than English, shortages of bilingual teachers and even the fact that dual-language programs often grow fastest in areas where upper-income parents ask for them. That's good for children who participate, but it worries advocates who want to see language-minority students have equal access.\n\nPressure is mounting in states where numbers of Latino English learners have surged. Mississippi, South Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas and Maryland have seen the number of English learners more than double from 2005 to 2015, according to federal data.\n\nIf we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime, says Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition.\n\nRosa Ramirez is a preschool teacher at Gates Street Early Education Center in Los Angeles and teaches a class through a bilingual education program. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nWhat's the best way to teach language skills to students?\n\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the percentage of Latino students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools swelled from 16% to 26%. The percentage of white students fell from 61% to 49%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nFederal law requires districts to identify students with limited English skills and to serve them with an equitable, research-based program. Practices vary widely between states and districts.\n\nSome schools use transitional bilingual programs, which teach academics such as science, math and social studies in Spanish for a few years before transitioning students to mainstream classes.\n\nMany use English as a Second Language instruction, a set of methods and techniques originally developed to teach English to foreign diplomats and university students. Instruction happens in English, and teachers have to be certified.\n\nThen there are English-only models, which call for separating language-minority children and having them learn all subjects only in English.\n\nIt's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition, says Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida, a state where almost 300,000 students are learning English.\n\nBut the research is really clear on what works, she says. Students learning English benefit from high-quality, long-term bilingual instruction programs.\n\nNationwide, there were about 3,000 dual-language programs as of 2015, says Santiago Wood, executive director of the National Association for Bilingual Education. That's a big increase over about 300 operating around 2001, he says, but not enough to help the surging numbers of English learners.\n\nIn some districts, the popularity of dual-language programs has led to concerns that English learners, who often come from lower-income families, will be pushed out by native English speakers from more affluent families.\n\nAt Oyster-Adams Bilingual School in Washington, for example, just 24% of students are English learners, according to school data.\n\nOyster's program was created to serve the Latino population, but gentrification over the past 40 years drove low-income families from the neighborhood, says Vanessa Bertelli, co-founder of a grassroots organization that advocates for more dual-language programs.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 students learning English in D.C., and even if every one of those students enrolled in a dual-immersion school, there wouldn't be enough seats for them, says Bertelli of the DC Language Immersion Project.\n\nThere's a lot of energy wasted on trying to allocate the pie, when what we should be doing is making more pies, she says.\n\nYou might also like: Google Assistant gets bilingual and responds in the language pair you use\n\nSonya Bertini, a bilingual special ed teacher at Vineland High School in New Jersey, works with a student on Sept. 30, 2019. Adam Monacelli, USA TODAY Network\n\nLearning 'English by osmosis' does not work for most students\n\nThe USA has a complicated history when it comes to Spanish in public schools.\n\nThe country does not have an official language, but for many decades, some states made English the law of their land by embracing practices that restricted or punished children for speaking a language other than English in schools.\n\nThe idea was time on task: put 'em in there, and they'll learn English by osmosis, Coady says. Sometimes that works for very young kids. But for a 10th grader coming into high school only speaking Mandarin who needs to graduate in three years? There's no way that child has equitable access.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, a focus on English-only instruction became more pronounced as a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment led to ballot initiatives in several states that effectively outlawed teaching in multiple languages.\n\nCalifornia voters approved a ban on bilingual education in public schools in 1998. Known as Proposition 227, the policy barred many children of Latino immigrants and Latino immigrant children from bilingual education, says Ramon Martinez, an assistant professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education in California.\n\nLed by California businessman Ron Unz and supported by the lobbying group ProEnglish, which favors English-only classes and the adoption of English as the official language of state and national government, similar restrictive bans passed in Arizona and Massachusetts.\n\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida It's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition.

Quote icon\n\nRamirez, the Gates Early Learning preschool teacher, was a student in East Los Angeles during the ban in California. She was taught in Spanish and English through second grade before Proposition 227 went into effect when she was about 8. After that, she struggled.\n\nI remember my third grade, I just kind of shut down because I had an idea and comprehended English, but I didn't feel confident to speak it, Ramirez says, holding back tears. Now coming back and working where I grew up, I feel like many years ago I was where my kids are now. I want to make sure they don't go through the lack of confidence I faced because of the language.\n\nCalifornia voters repealed the state's ban on bilingual education in 2016. Massachusetts overturned its English-only instruction law in 2017. Arizona officials, many of whom fought fervently for years to keep Spanish instruction out of public schools, are watering down its law, in part because outcomes for English learners there have been dismal.\n\nAt last count by the federal Department of Education, Arizona had the lowest graduation rate for English learners of all states: In 2016, only 32% of them graduated in four years.\n\nOur English language learner population was performing worse on tests than our special education population, says Republican state Sen.

Adam Monacelli, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nEnglish learners make progress\n\nThe city of Vineland, New Jersey, about an hour south of Philadelphia, represents changing U.S. demographics. More than 60% of the 11,000 students in Vineland Public Schools are Latino, reflecting a long-standing Puerto Rican community and a swell of migrants from Central America in recent years. Many of those new arrivals are teens who came without their parents and have no recent history of attending school.\n\nSome of the school's parents work in the surrounding eggplant and cauliflower fields during the day. Some are highly transient, migrating with the seasons wherever the work is.\n\nLike many districts in New Jersey, Vineland hosts a transitional bilingual program for students who arrive with limited English skills. This year, about 800 students are enrolled. They learn their core academics in Spanish – often right next door to classes where the same content is taught in English – but they have time built into the day for speaking, reading and writing in English.\n\nMore: Vineland ESL, bilingual programs win state honors\n\nDuring the first week of school this fall at Vineland High School, students in a 10th grade bilingual algebra class solved problems written on the board while their teacher wandered around, greeting students and checking their homework.\n\nDid you finish them all, Rafael? she asked one student in English.\n\nShe turned and saw that another had neglected to carry a negative number through an equation. She tapped the student's answer: Y un negativo, no? she said.\n\nVineland's bilingual program has been bolstered by JoAnne Negrin, supervisor of bilingual education. Since she was hired seven years ago, she made sure that all new textbook purchases were available in both Spanish and English, so students in the bilingual program could learn at the same pace as their English-speaking peers.\n\nShe made sure bilingual teachers in the lower grades weren't delivering the same lessons in both languages over the course of the day.\n\nIf you're repeating lessons every day, you're never going to help these children make progress, Negrin says.\n\nVineland's English learners show some of the highest academic improvement scores in the district, she says. Last year, the students met all the targets outlined on the state report cards.\n\nPeople sometimes question, 'How are students going to learn English if they spend the whole day learning in Spanish?'  Negrin says. Well, our data shows that proficiency in literacy in the child's first language is a very good indicator of how well that child is going to eventually learn English.\n\nOther small victories are happening. Kevin Sanchez, 17, who arrived from the Dominican Republic last year with limited English, won first place in a regional science fair after investigating how windmills worked and building a model of one.\n\nSanchez almost backed out from the fair when he learned that participants were required to make an oral presentation to the judges. Encouraged by his bilingual science teacher, Sanchez enlisted a friend to translate for him.\n\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Elena Perez, a bilingual preschool teacher at the University of California Los Angeles' Lab School People talk about closing the achievement gap, but it's more closing the opportunity gap.

The district has long supported a dual-language, Spanish-English program in all its elementary schools, which has helped close the gap in the early grades for those who are learning English. Students can choose to continue in the bilingual program in high school.\n\nAfter students graduate, they can continue their bilingual studies in Spanish and English at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe university added a minor in bilingual secondary education, says Janine Schall, chair of the bilingual and literacy studies department.\n\nMost of our students come from the local community and plan to return to teach in local K-12 schools after graduation, Schall said.\n\nThe university can't expand fast enough, she says. Would-be bilingual teachers often face challenges such as the cost of their education and the tests they have to take to become certified in bilingual education.\n\nWe know that there's a greater need for bilingual education teachers than we can meet right now, Schall says.\n\nLinda Ortiz and her daughter, Sophie, prepare to play Lotería, a popular Spanish game.

Fatima Hussein\n\nThe Indianapolis Star\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Eight years into their relationship, John Scott decided to add his girlfriend's name to the title of 10 acres he had long since inherited. But the Indiana man had a condition: She couldn't cheat on him.\n\nAnd they put it in writing.\n\nAbout two months after they signed the handwritten contract, his girlfriend, Tina Hemingway, became pregnant. By another man.\n\nTheir relationship was about to end. Their court battle was about to begin.\n\nHemingway delivered the child in January 2013. She moved out in early June 2013, and that same month, Scott sent Hemingway written notice that she was in breach of the contract and must return her interest in the property to him, according to court documents.\n\nDonald Sterling sues NBA, which already has counter\n\nHemingway filed a suit to partition the property, and subsequently, Scott filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\nScott, of Madison, Ind., won round one last year when Jefferson Circuit Court judge Darrell M. Auxier ruled in his favor. Hemingway filed an appeal in April.\n\nNeither party responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn her appeal, Hemingway argued that the property deed itself extinguished the contract and that the contract was unenforceable based on public policy that prohibits contracts in consideration of meretricious sexual services.\n\nBut the three appellate court judges disagreed with Hemingway that the agreement was based on a sexual contract and affirmed Auxier's ruling.\n\nThis contract is akin to a prenuptial agreement, in which the parties resolve ahead of time their relative rights in property should the relationship dissolve, states the decision, authored by Judge Terry A. Crone.\n\nBlind Ind. woman faces eviction after $43 land sale\n\nEven so, we observe that the contract does not require either party to perform sexual services. Nor does it require either party to abstain from all sexual activity, Crone wrote. Rather, it simply lists cheating by either party as one of the acts constituting breach.\n\nPrenuptial contracts forbidding extramarital affairs are nothing new to the court system. However, depending on the locale, they can have varying results.\n\nIn a 2002 case, Diosdado v. Diosdado, a California trial court found that an infidelity clause in a post-nuptial agreement was not enforceable because it was contrary to the public policy underlying California's no-fault divorce laws. However, in other states, infidelity laws reportedly are enforceable, provided the infidelity can be proven and the agreement does not violate state law.\n\nIn this case, the judges concluded that the appellant was inarguably unfaithful. In Crone's words, Hemingway wasted little time in breaching the contract.\n\nFollow Fatima Hussein on Twitter: @fatimathefatima
Jason Hall\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe oldest Baby Boomers are now in retirement age, while the youngest are in their 50s. Considering that many Baby Boomers don't have substantial retirement savings, Social Security is set to remain a critically important source of income for millions of that generation as they retire over the next couple of decades.\n\nHere's a closer look at three important facts that play a big role in how well Social Security will work for you and how much income you'll get. Whether you're ready to retire soon or still a decade or more away, these three facts about Social Security will affect you.\n\nFull retirement age is set to change soon\n\nOnce you turn 62, you become eligible for Social Security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at full retirement age. For anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. But for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase.\n\nStarting in 2020, anyone born in 1955 will reach full retirement age at 66 years, two months. For those born in 1956, they'll have to wait another two months, to 66 years, four months. This two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027.\n\nWhy does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.\n\nBut someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nIn other words, it's very important to know what your full retirement age is, no matter what age you plan to retire. A few months' difference could make thousands of dollars in difference in how much money you get.\n\nThis affects your spouse, too\n\nWhether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. In other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work – or at least delay filing for Social Security if they don't work – in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses.\n\nThis is particularly important to consider if your spouse will file on your work record, and is likely to outlive you. Here's what the Social Security Administration says about the survivor's benefit and how it could be lower if you retire before full retirement age.\n\nIf your spouse started receiving retirement benefits before their full retirement age, we cannot pay you the full retirement age benefit amount from their record. The maximum survivors benefit is limited to what they would receive if they were still alive.\n\nIn other words, before you decide to take Social Security early, you may want to consider how it would impact your surviving spouse's income if they are likely to outlive you and would receive the survivor's benefit.\n\nIf you're likely to live very long or die very early, it may affect when you should take Social Security\n\nSocial Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.\n\nBut if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. Here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death:\n\nThis table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.\n\nTake a balanced approach and consider all the repercussions\n\nThe facts above are largely about the financial impact of when you take Social Security. And while the financial part should play a primary role in when you file, it's not the only thing that matters. We must each also consider what kind of retirement we want, the value of other retirement assets and what we want to do with the time we have before we die.\n\nAnd the more you understand about Social Security before you retire, the more time you'll have to plan and prepare. If you want to maximize the quality and quantity of your retirement years, start today – no matter how far from retirement you are.\n\nTry any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nThere are some good reasons to turn down the California teachers who asked the Supreme Court on Monday to let them stop paying union dues.\n\nFor one thing, the case is a thinly disguised attempt by conservatives to weaken public employee unions, which tend to overwhelmingly support Democrats.\n\nFor another, deciding for the teachers would allow non-members to be free riders who could collect the wages and benefits the union negotiates without having to help pay the union's costs.\n\nAnd, finally, a ruling for the teachers would overturn an almost 40-year-old Supreme Court precedent that is the basis for collective bargaining agreements affecting millions of public employees around the country.\n\nAll that said, though, the justices would do well to side with the non-union teachers, who have a First Amendment right not to be compelled to support political speech they disagree with. That's at the core of the constitutional issue at stake here.\n\nSupreme Court education case threatens local control: Column\n\nThe case turns on whether unions can force non-members to pay an agency fee equal to the cost of representing them on purely work-related matters such as pay and working conditions.\n\nPublic employees don't have to join a union, even if a majority of their colleagues vote to have it represent them. In California and other states, though, the law compels the union to represent everyone — members and non-members alike — in collective bargaining. And in California and some 20 other states, unions are allowed to collect some dues from non-members for that representation.\n\nThat arrangement was blessed by the court in 1977, when the justices said unions couldn't require non-members to pay to support a union's political activities, such as backing political candidates, but could be charged for their fair share of bargaining costs.\n\nThe teachers who brought the current case say that decision got it wrong, because there's no real distinction between a public employee union's political and non-political activities. When bargaining for taxpayer money, everything is political: Paying teachers more means spending less on something else, which is a political decision. Furthermore, the teachers bitterly resent having to support many of the unions' workplace priorities, such as making it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers with seniority.\n\nThe court's conservative justices embraced the everything-is-politics argument Monday, and a majority seemed inclined to rule against the unions. Chief Justice John Roberts said even minor matters such as working hours or mileage reimbursements are always a public policy issue, and Justice Antonin Scalia agreed that the pay, benefits and conditions public employee unions negotiate are necessarily political questions.\n\nWill public employee unions wither away if the court rules they can't collect fees from non-members? The evidence strongly suggests not.\n\nThe nation's 25 right-to-work states already bar public employee unions from requiring membership or collecting agency fees, but those unions remain reasonably robust anyway. In fact, there's a compelling argument that taking away the right to force non-members to pay dues makes unions work harder to be responsive to prospective members.\n\nUndoing the 1977 decision would be the correct call for individual rights, and it might just improve public education.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.\n\nIdaho\n\nKellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released. Silver Mountain Resort is located about 60 miles east of Spokane, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Idaho Panhandle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:It will cost more to attend the Iowa State Fair this year. Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair's marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.\n\nMississippi\n\nHancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMacungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported\n\nTennessee\n\nSpring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state's U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTown: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors. Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — The father in Mike Tomlin regrets the language he used to describe the New England Patriots during the postgame speech Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown opted to livestream on social media after a taut playoff victory over Kansas City.\n\nThe coach in Tomlin has just as big an issue with one of his team's biggest stars forcing the Steelers to talk about something other than trying to find a way to finally beat Tom Brady when it counts.\n\nA characteristically blunt Tomlin called Brown's decision to broadcast to the world more than 17 minutes of Pittsburgh's giddy locker room celebration — a move that caught Tomlin using a handful of profanities — foolish, ''selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nNot only is it a violation of our policy, it's a violation of league policy, both of which he knows, Tomlin said Tuesday.\n\nSo there are consequences to be dealt with from his perspective. We will punish him. We won't punish us.\n\nTomlin took responsibility for his choice of words, though he was unaware of being filmed as he spoke.\n\nDuring Tomlin's post-game remarks, he attached an expletive to the Patriots, who earned a full day's head start on preparing for the Steelers by virtue of beating Houston on Saturday night, 24 hours before Pittsburgh outlasted Kansas City 18-16.\n\nThe responsibility associated with being in this thing, just from a role model standpoint, it's something that I personally embrace, Tomlin said.\n\nIt's something that we as a team and organization embrace. So that's why the language, specifically, in terms of the content, is regrettable.\n\nSo, too, is the action of the talented if sporadically diva-like Brown. The former sixth-round pick has evolved from a raw project into one of the NFL's best wide receivers.\n\nThis season he became only the second player in league history to post four consecutive 100-catch seasons.\n\nHis work ethic is universally lauded even as his Q-rating has skyrocketed. Brown can be found on TV pitching everything from soda to credit cards to video games.\n\nThe player who — for reasons he hasn't yet disclosed — occasionally refers to himself as Ronald  also has a devoted social media presence, with more than 1.5 million following on Instagram and an additional 650,000 on Facebook, many of whom got an eyeful and an earful as the Steelers celebrated their first trip to the AFC title game in six years.\n\nWhile Tomlin has very little concern about the content of the video, he has plenty of concern over Brown's lack of judgment.\n\nYou wear on your teammates when they routinely have to answer questions about things that aren't preparation or football-related, Tomlin said.\n\nIt's our desire for him and for everyone to be great teammates, as well as great players. He is a great player. He is a hardworking player. He is respected, largely, in the locker room for those things. But incidences such as this don't help him in that regard.\n\nThe Steelers have grown accustomed to Brown's flights of fancy, whether it's posing for the Mannequin challenge while meeting with reporters, wearing eye-opening (and fine threatening) cleats or doing over-the-top touchdown celebrations.\n\nThe fallout this time around has been mixed. Long snapper Greg Warren said Monday that AB is AB, he can do what he wants to do.\n\nBen Roethlisberger expressed disappointment in Brown during the quarterback's weekly appearance on 93.7 The Fan.\n\nEither way, the fact that both were forced to respond to questions about Brown before the biggest game of the season only reinforces Tomlin's point, though Tomlin stressed that Brown is hardly the only athlete capable of becoming a distraction.\n\nThose things don't apply exclusively to Antonio, Tomlin said. It's a global thing in regards to professional sports. I think that's why often times you see great players move around from team to team.\n\nAnd I definitely don't want that to be his story. I am sure he doesn't want that to be his story. So, he has to address these things that put him and us in positions from time to time, in settings such as this, where it needs to be addressed.\n\nTomlin didn't outline the internal discipline Brown faces other than to say it will not affect his availability this weekend.\n\nNew England (15-2) pulled away from the Steelers (13-5) in the second half of a 27-16 victory in Pittsburgh on Oct. 23, a game Roethlisberger missed while recovering from surgery on his left knee.\n\nRoethlisberger will be around this time. And so will Brown, who will almost certainly have his phone's camera turned off late Sunday evening regardless of the outcome.\n\nHe has to grow from this, Tomlin said. He has to.\n\nNOTES: LB James Harrison is dealing with shoulder and triceps injuries and could be limited early in the week. ... TE Ladarius Green remains in the concussion protocol more than three weeks after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit against Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
CINCINNATI – An Ohio Taco Bell employee declined to take the order of a man who is deaf. The employee no longer works at the establishment, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe patron, sitting in a vehicle at a drive-thru window, appears to attempt to communicate with the employee by writing messages on his phone, according to video of the exchange shared Wednesday by the man's mother in a public Facebook post.\n\nThe woman, identified as Becky Burch, wrote that the incident occurred at a Taco Bell in Kettering, Ohio, near Dayton.\n\nThis is my Deaf son getting discriminated against in the Taco Bell drive thru, the woman wrote. He was trying to show them his order and they told him it was against company policy to take his order that way. Really??\n\nThe employee also tells the man he will call 911 if you don't move, according to the video.\n\nTaco Bell released the following statement about the incident on Thursday:\n\nTaco Bell has a fundamental policy to respect all of our customers and employees, and we are committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or harassment. The franchise owner and operator of this location has investigated this situation and the team member no longer works for their organization. All team members at this restaurant are being retrained by the franchise owner on their policies.\n\nMore:January specials: Your monthly guide to freebies and meal deals
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to never accept defeat, then watched as hundreds of them stormed the U.S. Capitol and rampaged through the halls of Congress, later saying, We love you, you're very special to those involved in the deadly and appalling attack.\n\nOn Thursday, Hall of Fame golfers Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player stood with Trump at the White House to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom. They likely were the first outsiders to be with Trump at the White House since the reprehensible violence just 16 blocks away.\n\nSorenstam and Player, widely regarded as paragons of sportsmanship and honor in their game, did not cancel on Trump. They did not note the horror that had taken place on his watch and decide that Thursday wasn't an appropriate time to celebrate with him at the White House. They did not care about the gravity of the situation, about the calls from political leaders to remove Trump by impeachment or the 25th Amendment.\n\nNo. They willingly chose to accept an award from Trump and be seen with him a day after his words and actions launched one of the most shameful incidents in U.S. history.\n\nThere will be those who say Sorenstam, who was born in Sweden, and Player, from South Africa, can choose to accept an award from Trump whenever they wish. That is true. What's more, Sorenstam was an ardent supporter of Trump's failed re-election bid, retweeting Jack Nicklaus' multi-paragraph endorsement of Trump in the days before the 2020 election.\n\nBut Sorenstam and Player don't just represent themselves. They represent all of golf, a mostly lily-white sport that has struggled for decades, to its continuing detriment, to attract women and people of color – just as Trump, a creature of the game, has denigrated those very same people.\n\nOPINION: NBA stars Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler have seen two different Americas. They hope now everybody sees it.\n\nSON KNOWS BEST: Gary Player's son thinks father should decline Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nAs representatives of their game, and as business people who benefit greatly from it, their reputations are sullied, forever. Sorenstam and Player now will be attached to Trump at this horrible time in our nation's history, forever. They will be known as the people who had the chance to gracefully suggest another day might be better to celebrate golfers in this nation – golfers, for heaven's sake – and they refused to do so.\n\nThey had nothing to do with the insurrection of the Trump mob on Wednesday, of course, but they happily became Trump's Thursday accessories. They celebrated with him as our nation mourns what he has wrought.\n\nA third golfer, the late Babe Didrikson Zaharias, also was honored by Trump. This is just a guess, but it's hard to believe the strong, legendary, groundbreaking Babe would have allowed herself to have anything to do with that awful man.\n\nWhile Player, 85, who once supported his nation's racist policy of apartheid before later denouncing it, is an understandable Trump ally, Sorenstam's involvement with Trump is perplexing. She is one of the greatest women to ever play the game. Now 50, Sorenstam is known as a trailblazer for playing in a men's PGA Tour event, the Colonial, in 2003, enduring sexist taunts from a couple of male players while drawing huge crowds and acquitting herself quite well before missing the cut.\n\nWhen she retweeted Nicklaus' endorsement of Trump, I texted her a question:\n\nHow do you reconcile Trump's awful record on women – bragging and joking about sexually assaulting women (Access Hollywood tape), calling the Democratic VP nominee a 'monster,' being accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment by at least 26 women, etc. – while being a woman who has forged an amazing career around the issues of inclusion for women and treating women equally and fairly and with respect?\n\nShe never replied. On Thursday afternoon, I texted again, this time to say I'd like to talk to her about accepting the Medal of Freedom a day after the awful rampage of Trump supporters at the Capitol. She did not reply.\n\nIt turns out that the ceremony for Sorenstam and Player was not open to the press. There were no photos immediately available. The event was basically held in secret.\n\nActually, it was held in shame.
DAVOS, Switzerland — French President Emmanuel Macron told a crowd of internationalists that globalization is in a major crisis at the World Economic Forum Wednesday.\n\nHe kicked off his address with a joke related to climate change at the expense of President Trump, who arrives in this Alpine resort Thursday morning.\n\nWhen you arrive here and see the snow, it could be hard to believe in global warming, Macron said to a packed audience of business leaders and politicians. Obviously you don't invite anyone skeptical about global warming this year. Trump has commented in the past that he thinks global warming is a hoax.\n\nThe White House confirmed Wednesday that Macron would be the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner at the White House. No date was announced.\n\nMacron also said a stronger Europe was needed to avoid problems with people who feel they've been forgotten and left behind.\n\nHe called on world leaders to act in a multilateral way when confronting challenges from nations including North Korea and Iran, and when fighting extremist groups to avoid fracturing of the region. Trump's administration has threatened to withdraw from an international accord with Iran that freezes its nuclear weapons program.\n\nWe've got not only to win the war against terrorism but we've got to create conditions for durable peace, Macron said, adding that a multilateral political and diplomatic approach would help in the Middle East.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni echoed Macron's sentiments Tuesday, calling for a stronger Europe, and for a rejection of Trump's America First economic and trade policy.\n\nMore:Davos: Europe readies riposte to Trump's 'America first'\n\nMore:Davos 2018: Why do 3,000 of the world's most powerful people flock to a Swiss town?\n\nMore:Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to global elites: Trump's 'America First' is not America alone\n\nMore:How men can teach men not to be sexual harassers\n\nWe cannot end up in a world with a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of discontented workers, Gentiloni said. Our history and roots are not synonymous with protectionism.\n\nMerkel said that Germany is a country committed to finding multilateral solutions. Let us not shut ourselves off from the world, she said.\n\nMacron said the world is hitting roadblocks in several major areas.\n\nIn terms of trade, we are moving back again towards greater protectionism, greater fragmentation and we are undoing what globalization has been able to achieve, Macron said. In terms of climate change, we are losing the battle. How are we going to explain to people that they are going to be more vulnerable?\n\nContributing: Gregory Korte in Washington, D.C.
Wendy R. Sherman\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq. As fraught as Pompeo's visit to Kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n\nIt is President Donald Trump's failed policy toward Iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\n\nIraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure. But Iraq also created strange bedfellows. The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the Islamic State terrorism group. And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.\n\nThat uneasy balance was destroyed when Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal. Like other critics of the agreement, Trump believed it should have resolved all of America's issues with Iran. Trump believed we were giving Tehran benefits without a requisite return. He thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring Iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\n\nTrump policies devastate US interests\n\nLike much of Trump's national security and foreign policy, his Iran approach is tactical and not strategic. The results have been devastating to U.S. interests. Iran's most extreme hard-liners, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the United States couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\n\nIran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. Indeed, the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump's sanctions. And Iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\n\nLearning to manage conflict:As Iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\n\nIn Iraq, Iranian-backed militia, led by Kataeb Hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the Iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. A rocket attack by the Kataeb Hezbollah militia last Friday killed an American contractor and injured many. The Trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the New Year's Eve attack on our embassy.\n\nMost would agree that the United States had to respond in some way to the death of an American, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\n\nRegardless, if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy. Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward. Instead, in essence, Trump walked into Iran's trap.\n\nFor many Americans, the Baghdad militia chants of Death to America echoed the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\n\nIran nuclear deal was solid progress\n\nThe immediate emergency at our embassy in Baghdad has subsided. Kataeb Hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to America. They want the 5,000 U.S. troops out of Iraq.\n\nNonetheless, perhaps even Pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere. But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran's desire to exert greater control over Iraq. To much of the world, it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\n\nEven some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\n\nDiplomatic amateur hour:Sondland's impeachment testimony proves Trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\n\nConcerted action to curtail Iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of Americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. Had Trump stayed in the Iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the U.S. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge Iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\n\nThree years into his presidency, Donald Trump owns the events and outcomes in Iraq and Iran, as he does in North Korea, Afghanistan, Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia, China and Hong Kong. Having diminished our State Department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\n\nThe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of State's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\n\nWendy R.

Continuing the player-driven efforts in the fight for social justice, the NFL this week handed out 13 new grants to nonprofit organizations across the country as part of the Inspire Change initiative.\n\nInspire Change is the product of the partnership formed between the players and owners during the 2018 season and focuses on education, economic advancement, police and community relations and criminal justice reform. To date, the league and its teams have provided more than $95 million to programs across the country.\n\nThis year's new grants — which total roughly $4.3 million, according to the league — include new partners whose missions are aimed at helping to close the digital divide.\n\nEducation is a basic human right, and we can no longer deprive students of the tools they need to succeed, including devices and the internet, Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum, also a Players Coalition task force member and Player-Owner Social Justice Working Group member, said in a press release. I am proud of the work Players Coalition and the NFL has done to help close this 'digital divide' and help those children in underserved communities.\n\nThis year's 13 grant recipients join a roster of 20 organizations that the players and owners have and continued to sponsor since forming their partnership.\n\nThe 2021 recipients:\n\n• The Association for Enterprise Opportunity, which is based in D.C. and provides strategic and developmental assistance to Black owned businesses and targets the wealth gap that exists between Black and white American families.\n\n• Boys & Girls Clubs of America, which plans to use the funding to help create the TLC Youth Advocacy process, an effort to further educate 5,000 teens and build advocacy capacity via service-learning projects.\n\n• Breakthrough Miami, whose Changemaker Leadership Track supports Breakthrough Scholars and recent alumni to build capacities to challenge the digital divide, gain early work experience, college advising, financial literacy and leadership development.\n\n• L.A.-based Center for Policing Equity, and its efforts to expand COMPSTAT usage – a software that tracks incidents, identifies trends and holds departments accountable by measuring crime.\n\n• Covenant House, which is based in New York and focuses on workforce development and education services across the U.S. while serving youth and young families facing homelessness.\n\n• Just City-Memphis and its Memphis Community Bail Fund, the Clean Slate Fund, and Court Watch programs.\n\n• Bronx-based Ladies of Hope Ministries and its Faces of Women Imprisoned Speakers Bureau, Parole and Probation Accountability Project, and EPIC Ambassadors policy advocacy project.\n\n• MENTOR, which provides resources and tools on virtual mentoring made available to mentoring programs nationwide.\n\n• Oregon Justice Resource Center and its support of Women's Justice Project – the first and only program in Oregon that addresses the needs of women in the criminal justice system.\n\n• Brooklyn's Per Scholas, which enrolls 220 new individuals into its Software Engineering courses – a 15-week, full-time training program that will include technical instruction and professional development in efforts to advance economic equity.\n\n• Texas Appleseed's work in three areas that disproportionately affect Black and Latinx Texans from low-income backgrounds: driver's license suspensions, criminal record expungement and debt collection.\n\n• United Way Worldwide's Young Men United initiative, which aims to support 25,000 young men of color in the United States to and through post-secondary and into entry-level career positions.\n\n• Silver Spring, Maryland's US Dream Academy and its Children of Incarcerated Parents initiative, which provides mentorship, leadership training, educational support and career readiness for a unique population of primarily Black and Latinx young people in communities harmed by racial bias and mass incarceration.
Elizabeth Weise\n\nUSATODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Uber is going to make urban traffic and mobility data gleaned from its millions of drivers and riders using the Uber app freely available to all.\n\nThe data, which shows anonymized travel times between points in cities, will be available on a public website called Uber Movement.\n\nUber says it will first invite planning agencies and researchers to access the information and then make the website free to the public. The first cities will be Washington D.C., Manilaand Sydney.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company decided to release the data when it realized it had this very valuable but untapped resource for understanding a city's transportation infrastructure, said Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy.\n\nPegged to a transportation conference in DC on Sunday, the release is also likely is a bid to gain some goodwill with cities, with which Uber has often had bare-knuckled fights over regulation.\n\nThe announcement comes as Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing companies face demands from cities that they provide more information about their riders — demands they have long opposed.\n\nThe most recent square off is in New York City, where New York's Taxi & Limousine Commission will hold a public hearing on Thursday a demand that Uber give the city information about where and when drivers drop off passengers, something taxi drivers already are required to do.\n\nUber Movement doesn't map individuals rides, but rather segments of rides, focusing on travel time between specific points, Gilbertson said.\n\nWe're using ride data as a proxy, we're taking periodic GPS trace pings during the rides, he said.\n\nFor example, the Uber data showed changes in travel times in the Washington D.C. area when parts of the regional Metro were shut down for repairs.\n\nThe Uber data will give cities a low-cost way to do high-resolution travel time analysis. Robust traffic data of the sort needed by planners is often either expensive or out-of-date.\n\nFor us in the planning context, it's very interesting, said Jascha Franklin-Hodge, Boston's chief information officer.\n\nOftentimes, cities and state transportation systems use things like toll transponders to show how long it takes to get from one place to another. But those are on fixed routes. What's interesting is this allow us to look at a lot of different routes, he said.\n\nThe Uber data makes it possible to reliably estimate how long it takes to get from one area of a city to another by analyzing multiple trips over time.\n\nTo protect the privacy of Uber drivers and passengers, only areas with relatively high tip volume are included. Otherwise it might be possible to track the movement of a unique individual if only a few Uber trips went through a specific area in a given time.\n\nOn the maps, Uber grays out areas where trip numbers are too low to protect driver privacy.\n\nThe company has been beta testing the program with Washington D.C. The data will initially be available for a limited number of cities which will be added to over time. Uber currently is active in 450 cities worldwide.\n\nWhile the data isn't comprehensive enough to allow city planners to rely solely on it, it will be helpful. It also should be a boost to public engagement with planners, said Boston's Franklin.\n\nThis gives people tools to ask us questions. That's really powerful. We believe in having an informed public and having conversations that are rooted in facts, so the more of facts that are available, the better, he said.
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped a new trade ambassador Tuesday while tweeting on topics ranging from congressional ethics to trade policy to changing President Obama's health care plan to keeping open the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nIn nominating former Reagan administration official Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. Trade Representative, Trump echoed the attacks he made on various trade deals during the presidential campaign.\n\nLighthizer has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans, Trump said in a statement. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.\n\nA critic of China trade practices in particular, Lighthizer said he is fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.\n\nTrump made the announcement while preparing for another day of briefings and jobs interviews at his Manhattan office tower.\n\nThe president-elect also stayed busy on social media. In a flurry of new tweets, Trump:\n\n• Questioned House Republicans for gutting a congressional ethics investigating committee, tweeting that the GOP should focus on issues like tax reform and health care; however, Trump also described the independent ethics committee's work as unfair. House Republicans later reversed course on plans to end the committee's work.\n\n• Threatened General Motors — and presumably other companies — with the imposition of a border tax over operations in Mexico.\n\n• Again pledged to dismantle President Obama's health care plan, saying it just doesn't work, and it is not affordable.\n\n• Warned Obama against last-minute releases from the terrorism prisoner camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield, he tweeted.\n\nLater in the week, Trump plans to receive a special security briefing on allegations that Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials during last year's presidential election, aides said. Trump, who has questioned whether Russia was involved, is awaiting a final report being developed by intelligence agencies at Obama's request.\n\nAmong the jobs he plans to fill in the coming days: director of National Intelligence, secretary of Agriculture and secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far?\n\nTrump blasts GM for Mexican-made Chevy Cruze\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to kill the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with Pacific Rim nations. He also vowed to re-negotiate, or possibly scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrade played a role in Trump's latest tweet storm, as he criticized General Motors for making Chevrolets in Mexico and selling them in the United States.\n\nIn announcing the selection of Lighthizer, the Trump transition team noted that he served Reagan as deputy United States trade representative, playing a major role in developing trade policy for the Reagan Administration and negotiating roughly two dozen bilateral international agreements on a variety of topics from steel to grain. These agreements were uniformly tough and frequently resulted in significant reductions in the shipment of unfairly traded imports into the United States.\n\nIn recent years, Lighthizer has worked on trade issues as a partner with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\nThe Senate must still confirm Lighthizer's nomination as trade representative.\n\nThere is some question as to how much power the trade representative will have in a Trump administration.\n\nThe president-elect has said he will give more trade authority to the Commerce department, to be headed up by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.\n\nTrump also picked another China critic, Peter Navarro, to head up a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy.
Jim Waymer\n\nFlorida Today\n\nMELBOURNE, Fla. — Federal regulators have denied six pending permits for using high-powered airguns to scan the ocean floor for signs of oil and gas deposits from Florida to Delaware.\n\nThe permits were no longer needed because the federal government removed those waters from the list of areas available to be leased for oil and gas exploration between 2017 and 2022, according to a release Friday from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nEnvironmental groups touted the decision as a major victory for coastal habitats and future tourism, while industry officials said it would hamper America's energy independence, scientific knowledge and jobs.\n\nHorrific, David Mica, executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council, a division of the American Petroleum Institute, said of the decision. This agency has stated over and over again — even under this administration — how safe and efficient and how scientifically proven geological science is to do this. So I see it as a horrific political example that's only the latest in disregarding American energy security needs.\n\nThe use of airgun seismic surveys would have generated maps or models of rock distributions and other geological structures to show potential for oil and gas deposits. But conservation groups worried that the seismic testing could harm marine life, especially endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n\nU.S. oil companies poised for rebound\n\nThat really put our right whales at risk, said Amy Tidd of Rockledge, who organized anti-oil-drilling rallies at Florida beaches. We need to protect our marine mammals. I think this is a great step toward protecting them and protecting our beaches.\n\nBOEM officials said it's unlikely the information from seismic airgun surveys would be used if the federal government does not offer the Atlantic for future oil and gas leasing. The agency also pointed out that even if the area is opened to drilling in the future, the information gathered would become outdated.\n\nThe deep-penetration seismic surveys are conducted by vessels that tow an array of airguns that emit acoustic energy pulses into the seafloor over large areas and long periods of time, according to BOEM. The airguns penetrate several thousand meters beneath the seafloor.\n\nConservation groups worry the airguns could harm whales, dolphins and other marine life.\n\nNumerous studies demonstrate the negative impacts that seismic airgun noise has on ocean ecosystems, including reduced catch rates of commercially valuable fish and silencing bowhead whales, the nonprofit group Oceana said in a press release. The government's own estimates state that seismic airgun blasting in the Atlantic could injure as many as 138,000 marine mammals like dolphins and whales, while disturbing the vital activities of millions more.\n\nShallow-depth surveys for other purposes typically don't use airguns. While surveys may have some impacts to marine life, airgun seismic surveys have the potential for greater impacts, BOEM officials said.\n\nMore than 120 East Coast municipalities, 1,200 elected officials, 35,000 businesses and 500,000 fishing families have publicly opposed offshore drilling and/or seismic airgun blasting, according to Oceana, which has fought against the seismic testing.\n\nCocoa Beach was one of the cities that passed resolutions against seismic airgun testing.\n\nWe're pretty happy, Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik said of Friday's decision. We're pretty sensitive to our coast and making sure it's preserved for future generations.\n\nThe pending permits from oil or gas exploration spanned from Delaware to Florida.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama declared certain federal waters of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans off-limits to offshore oil and gas drilling — for good.\n\nThe ban does not include Atlantic waters off Florida and would not affect current oil and gas leases, but it aims to stop indefinitely the sale of new leases in an area of the Atlantic stretching from about Rhode Island to southern Maryland — and in the Arctic's Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska.\n\nObama designated 31 Atlantic canyons along the Continental Shelf off limits to oil and gas exploration and development due to their critical and irreplaceable ecological value. The withdrawn area totals 5,990 square miles (or 3.8 million acres). The measure would protect deep-sea coral, fish habitat and other marine life, administration officials said.\n\nAPI Director of Upstream and Industry Operations Erik Milito said Friday's decision harms the nation's energy security, scientific research and was politically driven.\n\nWe are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this short-sighted course, Milito said in a prepared statement, and base its decisions on facts so that we can have a forward-looking energy policy to help keep energy affordable for American consumers and businesses, help create jobs, and strengthen our national security.\n\nTidd said the airgun permit denials are also a victory for Florida's economy.\n\nOur economy depends on clean beaches. and to do anything that puts that at risk is foolhardy, she said.\n\nFollow Jim Waymer on Twitter: @JWayEnviro
Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the shutdown's current impact on growth.\n\nWhen the next recession strikes, it won't be as bad as the last one, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted Tuesday.\n\nYou will have a recession. It just won't be like you had the last time in ... affecting the banking system, he said in a call Tuesday with analysts after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nThe chief executive said the larger banks have been more prudent when approving new loans. It's the newer, non-bank lenders – dubbed shadow banks – that could have problems during a recession, he predicted.\n\nSomeone's going to get hurt, he said. The issue there for the marketplace is going to be, we have a recession, the lender will not be there. So a lot of these borrowers will be stranded.\n\nMore Money: Ask HR: My boss has body odor and bad breath. What can I do about this issue?\n\nMore Money:Chick-fil-A testing spicy new menu items in select markets, considering nationwide rollout\n\nDimon didn't forecast when he expected a downturn to occur. The company's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said despite some softness recently in manufacturing and capital expenditures, the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong, especially among consumers.\n\nIt's good, Dimon agreed.\n\nGovernment shutdown concerns\n\nDimon also weighed in on the partial government shutdown in an earlier call with the media. He repeated recent estimates by some economists that the government shutdown could sap all growth from the world's biggest economy.\n\nSomeone estimated that if it goes on for the whole quarter, it can reduce growth to zero, Dimon said. We just have to deal with that. It's more of a political issue than anything else.\n\nHis figures aren't off, says Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.\n\nFurloughed workers make up about 0.5 percent of the total U.S. workforce and contribute roughly about the same to the economy, he said. That means an extended shutdown could shrink the economy by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, he said, which would reduce its growth rate by 2 percent on an annual basis.\n\nSo, if it lasts the whole quarter, zero growth is very plausible, for the first quarter, Baker wrote in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nDimon's comments on the shutdown come on the same day that Delta Air Lines' CEO said the airline is losing about $25 million in business because of the shutdown. Ed Bastian told CNBC that fewer government employees and contractors are traveling, resulting in the decline.
Nick McCarvel\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE - Tennis officials sounded off Monday afternoon at a BuzzFeed and BBC report that claimed match-fixing is still a problem in tennis, and includes cases that involve a top 50 player and former Grand Slam singles and doubles champions.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn't being thoroughly investigated, ATP chairman Chris Kermode said in a press conference called to address the report.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit, or the TIU, was set up in 2008 to investigate match fixing at every level of the sport. In its existence, 18 convictions have been made, including six life bans.\n\nAll of us here are absolutely committed to stamp out any corrupt conduct, Kermode said. There is a zero-tolerance policy. All sport, just not tennis, is at risk to corruption … and that is why in 2008 the TIU was set up to tackle this issue head-on.\n\nNigel Willerton, the director of the TIU, would neither confirm nor deny that there were any players currently on the tour that are being investigated by the TIU.\n\nThe BuzzFeed/BBC report said that the TIU had been warned about 16 core players as part of the scandal, all of whom had been ranked inside the top 50 at some point, but none of whom were sanctioned. The focus of the report was a 2008 probe that it says was shelved by tennis authorities, ignoring evidence presented with a nice pink bow that they took no action at all with.\n\nThe governing bodies of tennis (ITF, ATP World Tour, WTA and the four Grand Slam events) issued a joint statement calling out the report for using what they call information, suspicion or hearsay over evidence, as Kermode noted in his comments.\n\nWillerton added that the TIU can make demands of personal phones and laptops of players they suspect to be involved in match-fixing. When needed, the TIU works with necessary law enforcement.\n\nAll eyes on Novak Djokovic as he starts quest for elusive Grand Slam\n\nIt's always disappointing when stories like this come out in front of an event, Kermode said, noting that the story was released on the eve of the first Grand Slam of 2016, the Australian Open. We are confident there is nothing in the sport that has been suppressed. The TIU tackles this issue. Tennis is in a very, very good place.\n\nSome $14 million have been invested in the TIU and it's constantly being reviewed Kermode said.\n\nThe main press room in Rod Laver Arena was packed to the gills as a host of international media attended the press conference, which included officials from the WTA, ITF, U.S. Tennis Association and the sport's other biggest bodies.\n\nKermode stressed that the TIU focuses on evidence over information.\n\nThe BuzzFeed and BBC investigation suggested that the TIU was understaffed, calling it a plastic solution that has furthered the match-fixing problem in tennis.\n\nAustin Krajicek, an American ranked No. 82 in the world and who has played most of his career on the lower-level Challenge circuit (where match-fixing has been found at its most prevalent in the past, told USA TODAY Sports he had never been approached by betters or heard of match-fixing separate from rumors.\n\nI've never been approached, he said. I know the ATP takes that stuff really seriously. To be honest, I've never heard of someone being approached. I've heard rumors, but I haven't had any contact with it. It can't be tolerated.
LAS VEGAS – Sex toys are back on the CES show floor. And Lora Haddock DiCarlo deserves a lot of the credit.\n\nWe want to reshape how people think about sex tech, says the CEO and founder of the company that bears her name and markets such products.\n\nWe shamed pleasure (tech) for so long, she says. The fact is that sexual health and wellness (products) are health and wellness products.\n\nThat's the category under which the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which organizes the event, is letting such companies exhibit at the 2020 industry shindig. But it took some convincing.\n\nIn DiCarlo's telling, the backstory begins with an orgasm, leading to the company's first in a family of hands-free robotic massagers called Osé. Osé emerged in partnership with the robotics lab at Oregon State University, which, DiCarlo points out, included several female engineers.\n\nHer company applied for and was granted a CES innovation award for the prototype that was Osé, stating up-front that the product is meant to stimulate a woman's G-spot and clitoris. But about a month later, when Lora DiCarlo asked for Osé to be included in a product showcase at CES and to exhibit at the show, the CTA took the award away on the grounds, DiCarlo says, that they found it immoral, obscene, and profane.\n\nCES flashback:If LG's rollable OLED TV sounds familiar, there's a reason\n\nVoice tech:For people who stutter, the convenience remains out of reach\n\nWhat caught our eye:4 cool gadgets at CES\n\nA backlash ensued over the sexist stance toward the female-focused product, and the CTA eventually bowed to the pressure. It not only apologized to DiCarlo and reversed its reversal of the award, but began a dialogue with her that resulted in a new policy, opening up floor space in the health and wellness area for such sex tech exhibitors.\n\nThe ban actually raised DiCarlo's profile and, while not necessarily the route she would have chosen, has been good for business. She pre-sold more than 10,000 Osé units in December (at $290 each), and has tripled the size of the company. At CES 2020, DiCarlo's company will unveil two new bio-mimetic pleasure devices under the names Baci and Onda.\n\nControversy over sex is nothing new for CES. In its earliest days, the show incorporated members of the porn industry.\n\nThe Adult Entertainment Expo eventually became its own event, though for some years it ran concurrently with CES, though not presently.\n\nAside from that, many companies at CES have employed attractive scantily clad booth babes, the term coined for women whose job it is to lure foot traffic to a mostly male audience. The CTA has said it maintains the right to remove people wearing what it considers inappropriate attire.\n\nCritics of the show have also complained through the years about the lack of inclusiveness when it comes to speaking roles, with most prominent keynote slots given to male executives.\n\nAt this year's CES, Ivanka Trump will be speaking which has generated its own controversy.\n\nFor her part, DiCarlo says the inclusion of sex tech exhibitors is all about normalizing the way people talk about a subject deemed by some as off-limits. We believe that having open conversations about our bodies and human sexuality is the right thing to do, she says.\n\nStill, it will be worth watching over the next several days the kind of response sex tech actually gets.\n\nThe big question for me is how brands will talk and position these gadgets, says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Will it be about women, their pleasure and health or, as we very often see, the gadgets marketed will be about men?\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter.
Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Transportation Department thinks airline travelers should know all the bag and seat-assignment fees they face before paying for a ticket. But after proposing in May 2014 to require airlines to provide that information, the administration continues to grapple with hundreds of comments on all sides of the issue.\n\nThe department's plan aims to alert travelers to the precise fees regardless of where they purchase their tickets. Half of all tickets are bought somewhere other than from airlines directly. Shopping at comparison web sites can be complicated, and some airlines change fees based on frequent-flier status or even the credit card used to buy a ticket.\n\nBut the proposal stopped short of requiring airlines to charge the fee at the moment the ticket is bought, something that consumer advocates had urged as a policy called transactability. Some travelers have complained about fees that surprise them upon arrival at the airport.\n\nAs airlines divide their ticket prices into optional services such as bags, seating and food, The fees have grown into big business, with bag fees totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, according to the department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nIf the rule is adopted, airlines would have to disclose fees for first and second checked bags, carry-on bags and for advanced seat assignments that often provide extra legroom before the traveler pays for the ticket.\n\nThe department remains of the view that as carriers continue to unbundle services that used to be included in the price of air transportation, passengers need to be protected from 20 hidden and deceptive fees and allowed to price shop for air transportation in an effective manner, the 118-page proposal says.\n\nAfter receiving more than 750 comments, DOT has been grappling with whether to change or scrap anything in the proposal. No deadline is set for action, but the department's latest formal estimate is that the proposal will be finalized by June.\n\nIt's urgent, said Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer-advocate Travelers United. The sooner we do it, the sooner that consumers can start to comparison shop.\n\nMelanie Hinton, a spokesman for the trade group Airlines for America, said it would be premature to comment on a rule before it is finalized. But she argued that airlines are already one of the most transparent industries for pricing, with the market dictating prices that are considerably less and far more plentiful than under government regulation.\n\nCustomers today are able to choose among carriers and select the best services offerings, Hinton said.\n\nDOT extends deadline to comment on airline fees, performance\n\nAirlines argued that the department doesn't have the power to regulate fees after Congress deregulated the industry in 1978, because the services are optional. But the department contends it is authorized under a section of federal law calling on it to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in air transportation.\n\nAs much or more than any other industry, airlines depend upon repeat customers to sustain the business model, Delta Air Lines said in its comments on the rule. Delta has every incentive NOT to treat our customers unfairly or deceptively, and we strive to clearly and accurately inform our customers about Delta's fees for ancillary services, specifically including baggage and preferred seating.\n\nThe proposal is the third in a string of aviation consumer rules, with the first adopted in 2009. Earlier rules set large fines for lengthy tarmac delays and forced airlines to post the full cost of a ticket with taxes when advertising fares.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association said nearly half (45%) of 1,031 travelers surveyed in February 2014 found it difficult to budget for travel because of fees, and that one-fourth faced a fee at the airport they didn't anticipate.\n\nFrancis Komola of Bradford, Mass., told the department that making the cost more obvious for advanced seat assignments that provide extra legroom is the most important part of the proposal.\n\nA significant amount of personal information has to be provided to United Airlines, for example, before the total cost of the flight is available to customers like me, Komola said.\n\nA rule that went into effect in January 2012 required airlines to notify passengers that baggage fees may apply and to post fees on their websites. The specific fees for first and second checked bags must be included in the summary after a purchase and post-purchase email.\n\nBut travelers complain that some airlines don't include fees in the initial purchase, and it becomes a surprise at the airport.\n\nDisplaying all fees as part of the ticket price levels the playing field and makes it much easier for consumers to compare apples to apples, said Matthew Kirkland of Watkinsville, Ga.\n\nSenate studies airline fees at $6 billion and growing\n\nOf course, the industry isn't monolithic. Southwest Airlines promotes its lack of baggage fees and supports greater transparency for its rivals that may also exert downward pressure on fees.\n\nPart of the dispute involves the technical side of how travelers shop for fares. Travel agents, whether mom-and-pop shops or online sites, urged the department to force airlines to provide detailed fees so they could relay them to customers.\n\nIt would not be remotely practical for a ticket agent to establish direct connections with hundreds of airlines in order to obtain the data and comply with the proposed disclosure obligations, Priceline.com told the department.\n\nBut Delta warned that making ticket searches more complicated could dampen sales. Travelers highly value speed and efficiency in the reservations process and tend to abandon searches after 430 seconds, the carrier said.\n\nAmerican Airlines cited department cost estimates that the fee provision would cost airlines $46 million over a decade and yield benefits of $25 million. The cost estimate was based on additional technology -- for equipment, software and labor -- to post the fees, according to a DOT analysis. The projected benefits are based on consumers buying more optional services and airlines reducing their administrative costs for managing complaints, the DOT analysis said.\n\nThe costs at issue are quite real and will inevitably be passed along to consumers in this intensely competitive industry, the carrier said.\n\nUnited Airlines said requiring fees with search results involving multiple carriers would take longer and lead to information overload.\n\nUnited has learned over many years — through extensive consumer feedback and other empirical observations — that many customers do not want this information at any point, and certainly not when they are looking at the first display that shows their search results, the carrier said.\n\nAirline: 10 'bizarre' things fliers have done to avoid bag fees
Zeke Miller\n\nAssociated Press\n\nJERUSALEM – President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday that the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and on Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.\n\nBolton, who traveled to Israel to reassure the U.S. ally of the Trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria, but insisted it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThose conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of IS in Syria, and protections for Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group.\n\nBolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.\n\nTrump announced in mid-December that the U.S. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria. Trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nBolton, who is to travel on to Turkey on Monday, said the U.S. is insisting that its Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State group are protected from any planned Turkish offensive. He is to deliver a warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week.\n\nWe don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said.\n\nTrump has stated that he would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds, Bolton said. That's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\n\nBolton said the U.S. has asked its Kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. He said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford would continue negotiations with his Turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for America's Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nHe added that Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, would travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned.\n\nBolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical are of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's Constitutional authority, adding I'm a strong believer in Article II.\n\nBolton on Sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. He watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his Israeli equivalent, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer.\n\nVisiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit. Israel captured the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 war.
Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nU.S. long-term government bonds are in demand again and the dollar is losing some of its luster as Wall Street downgrades its views on interest rate hikes.\n\nWith markets experiencing turbulence and the global economy facing myriad headwinds, investors are again flocking to the perceived haven of bonds issued by Uncle Sam. The reason: Wall Street is pretty much ruling out a March rate hike by the Federal Reserve and thinks the U.S. central bank may remain on hold for the remainder of the year.\n\nThat shift in thinking about U.S. interest rate policy is pushing the value of the dollar down, a development that is positive for commodities and for U.S. multinationals that do a lot of business abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, hit an intraday low of 1.79%, its lowest yield since Feb.5, 2015 — or a 12-month low. The yield has since crept back up to 1.90% in early trading Thursday but the sub-2% yield is a sign rate hikes are no longer a big fear on Wall Street -- at least for now.\n\nThe dollar also weakened Wednesday, a trend that remains in place in early trading Thursday.\n\nThe weakening dollar tells me investors are sensing there's no way the Fed can tighten anytime soon, Nick Sargen, senior investment advisor at Fort Washington Investment Advisors, told USA TODAY.\n\nInvestors' renewed love affair with U.S. government bonds also follows a weaker-than-expected January reading on the U.S. services sector, which is a key pillar of the consumer-focused U.S. economy. The weaker number, released Wednesday, led to speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates at its March meeting -- and may pass on rate hikes altogether this year. The Fed earlier this year had said it would like to hike rates another full percentage point in 2016 after a quarter-point hike in December. But Wall Street is now questioning that so-called hawkish pace of rate hikes.\n\nSome pundits believe the bond market may be sniffing out a coming recession, or at least pricing in a greater probability of a slowdown, due in large part to global pressures from places such as China and emerging markets -- and the downside fallout of the dollars sharp rise against other currencies prior to this week's reversal.\n\nThe downward pressure on yields is causing pain in shares of banks, however, which benefit from rising rates as they can lend money at higher rates and benefit from a wider spread between rates they charge borrowers and interest they pay savers. In Wednesday trading, bank stocks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, briefly touched fresh 52-week lows before mounting a late rebound. The biggest worry for bank stocks is the prospect of Fed rate hikes getting pushed out, says Ralph Bassett, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management.
Nancy Tengler\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe stock market is rational, despite what it looks like.\n\nWhich brings me to the latest report on U.S. hiring from Friday.\n\nThe change in nonfarm payrolls in the report disappointed some. New jobs came in below expectations at a net addition of 145,000 jobs in December versus estimates of 160,000. November's blowout number of 266,000 new jobs was revised down by 10,000 jobs. Good, but not spectacular.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained at a 50-year low. It would appear just about everyone who wants to work is working. Job growth is not too hot to spark inflation concerns and not too low to signal inflation. Which is likely to keep the Fed on the sidelines.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that wages aren't growing as fast as the experts expected.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose a modest 0.1% in December compared to an estimate of 0.3%. Year over year, average hourly earnings rose a manageable 2.9%, again versus expectations of 3.1%.\n\nMost popular models in each state:Ford's F-series remains America's best-selling vehicle, but in 19 states these models were more popular\n\nBuying a home may be easier:More starter homes are getting built\n\nBut consumers don't need significant wage increases to prosper. Despite unexpectedly low wage growth, the consumer is confident and still spending. That is because inflation is well below 2%, interest rates are near historic lows, tax-cuts increased net take-home pay and energy costs are muted. Since the American consumer drives two-thirds of domestic GDP growth (and 17% of global GDP growth) he or she matters to growth. And the picture looks pretty rosy.\n\nSo, Friday's job report is bullish for stocks for three reasons.\n\n1. The Fed is more likely to stay on the sidelines, with jobs growing at reasonable but not blowout levels and wage growth manageable. Think of steady jobs and wage growth as the sweet spot for Fed policy which is good for stock investors.\n\n2. If Americans are working, they are contributing to their 401(k) accounts, putting money into the market every two weeks and potentially driving stock prices higher. As companies buy back shares while investors increase allocation to stocks – supply becomes scarcer in the face of increased demand. It's econ 101.\n\n3. If wage growth remains muted (as it did in December), corporate margins are not at risk. The worry for investors has been that as the unemployment rate reaches historic lows and the employment participation rate maxes out, wage pressure would rise and negatively impact corporate earnings and margins. That does not yet seem to be happening – another bit of good news for stocks.\n\nWhen you are tempted to throw in the towel and declare the market irrational, remember that it is a forward discounting mechanism that is already looking past today's news to what that means for the future.\n\nWe believe that the market may need a correction to prune excesses and reaccelerate from here. But when a sell-off occurs, remember that the underlying fundamentals for stock performance continue to be more bullish than not. And if your neighbors are working, that is better for the economy and good for all of us.\n\nNancy Tengler is chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, ButcherJoseph Asset Management and the author of The Women's Guide to Successful Investing.
AP\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Former NFL and Iowa safety Tyler Sash, who died last year at age 27, has been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nChris Nowinski of the Boston University-affiliated Concussion Legacy Foundation confirmed the diagnosis on Tuesday night. The New York Times was the first to report the finding.\n\nCTE, which can be diagnosed only after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former football players. Linked to repeated brain trauma, it is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, impaired judgment, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.\n\nSash, who won a Super Bowl during his rookie season with the New York Giants, was found dead at his home on Sept. 8. The Iowa State Medical Examiner's office found he died from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor.\n\nMonths after the Super Bowl victory, Sash was suspended for four games in 2012 for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing substances policy by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The Giants cut ties with Sash prior to the 2013 opener, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the preseason finale against New England.\n\nAt Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007-10, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season. He bypassed his fourth year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft.
LONDON (Project Syndicate) — One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran — the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. Iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nBut, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the Iranian people with the status quo — especially their own role in it.\n\nTo be clear, despite the massive scale of the protests, they are very unlikely to bring down the regime. Iran's security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system, which gives them control of vast swaths of the Iranian economy.\n\n Iran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East. Amid the current protests, however, the West has a golden opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on domestic economic conditions. \n\nMoreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives. No matter how much encouragement Western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with Islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps retaining control of most of the state's assets and security activities.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that nothing will change. Nor does it mean that the West has no leverage to exercise.\n\nIt is possible, for example, that Rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.\n\nBut this would hardly count as success for the protesters. After all, Rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. If protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning Iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman's Ambitious Plans for Saudi Arabia\n\nWhether Rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. Iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. But, thanks partly to persistent corruption — Iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. According to Gallup, only citizens of Iraq and South Sudan are more pessimistic about their future.\n\nSo far, Rouhani has been unwilling or unable to use the power of the presidency to reform Iran. But, amid the protests, he is more motivated than ever to improve domestic economic conditions. Should he fail, Iran may face a larger wave of protests, with stronger leadership and clearer objectives.\n\nAny effort to reform Iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.\n\nIt should not have come as a surprise when protesters shouted, Let go of Syria; think about us.\n\nIranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country's foreign policy. Most Western and Middle Eastern governments are also highly concerned about Iran's behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty. Iran's public threats to destroy America and the Gulf states certainly don't help matters.\n\nIran's problematic foreign policy is the result not of mismanagement, but of toxic ideology. Indeed, two fixed notions underpin it.\n\nFirst, Iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.) Second — and more dangerous — Iran's leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate. The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.\n\nIran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East over the past decade, beachheads that regime hardliners regard as crucial national-security and foreign-policy assets.\n\nAmid the current protests, however, the West has an opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation. If an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if Iran's leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.\n\nTo be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran's government, appeals based on Iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. But if Rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.\n\nIran is at a turning point. The world must now send its regime a clear message: stop destabilizing the region and help your own people to prosper.\n\nThis article was published with permission of Project Syndicate — The Best Hope for the Iranian People
The minutes of the Federal Reserve' December meeting showed a willingness to delay further interest rate hikes given the volatility in financial markets and concern about global growth, according to minutes of that meeting released Wednesday.\n\nWith the backdrop of market turmoil and rising concerns about global growth many participants expressed the view that, especially in the environment of muted inflation pressures, the FOMC could afford to be patient about further policy firming, the minutes show.\n\nThey argued that weak inflation readings allowed th central bank some latitude to wait and see how the data developed in light of the rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the minutes show.\n\nA number of officials said the Fed should be mindful of the downside risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making any further changes to policy. Officials stressed policy was not on a pre-set course.\n\nThe minutes suggest a cautious approach to future monetary policy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in an interview on CNBC.\n\nThe minutes also dovetail with the remarks from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell late last week, who stressed the Fed would change policy swiftly if economic conditions warrant the change. Powell 's remarks calmed markets who viewed the chairman as too upbeat at his press conference after the December rate hike.\n\nRead: Powell signals he's flexible on interest rates\n\nThe minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.\n\nBut other Fed officials were against tapering the pace of the run-off, saying they were worried it would be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary policy.\n\nA few Fed officials were also against a December interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the FOMC decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.\n\nThough financial conditions had tightened and global growth had moderated, [voting] members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong, the minutes said.\n\nThe voting members did say that they didn't see the need for many more interest-rate hikes.\n\nThe FOMC judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would likely be appropriate, the minutes said.\n\nThe Fed has penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, down from three hikes projected in September.\n\nFinancial markets currently see no chance of a rate hike in 2019.\n\nWhile Fed officials remained optimistic about the outlook, contacts in a number of Fed districts were less upbeat, the minutes said.
The American Dream seems more attainable overseas.\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from Haiti and African countries and said the U.S. needed more immigrants from countries like Norway. On Friday, Trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. The president's reported comments were described as racist by Rupert Colville, the United Nations spokesman for human rights. Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-denies-questioning-migration-from-shithole-countries-1515766158\n\nDon't miss:Less than half of Americans say they're middle class\n\n Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years. \n\nIn fact, Norway ranked No. 1 for happiness and personal freedom, according to an analysis of three separate studies on life expectancy by the World Bank, on civil liberties from Freedom House, a New York-based nonprofit that conducts research on advocacy and democracy, on happiness from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a group linked to the United Nations, and on rule of law from the World Justice Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\nThe analysis was released by information-analytics firm LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a RELX Group RELX, -0.16% company, found that countries that have established a strong rule of law have significantly more success in securing measures of life, liberty and happiness for their citizens. Sweden ranked No. 2 and Canada was No. 3, followed by Australia, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. The U.S. ranked No. 19 just behind the Czech Republic, Japan and France. Afghanistan ranked last at No. 98.\n\nNorway ranked No. 1 for happiness, the U.S. was No. 14\n\nNorway was also No. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 World Happiness Report, up from No. 4 the year before, followed by Denmark (last year's No. 1), Iceland and Switzerland. The U.S. was trailing at No. 14. These four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.\n\n 'Norway maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By producing its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future.' \n\nThe World Happiness Report was released in March 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization Gallup, and was put together by SDSN, a group linked to the United Nations and led in part by economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, known for The End of Poverty and other books. Where necessary, Gallup seeks the permissions of national, regional, and local governments. The interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.\n\nNorway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.\n\nU.S. has fallen on happiness list among OECD countries\n\nThe U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.\n\n The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business. \n\nExperts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.\n\nThe U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.\n\nKeeping a Millennial Staff Happy, and More\n\nU.S. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare\n\nPresident Trump's latest remarks about immigrants follows criticisms last month made by Professor Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, about growing inequality in the U.S. He released a report heaping scorn on what he described as the Trump administration's dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. He cited the administration's current tax proposals and dramatic cuts in welfare.\n\n UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, criticized the 'dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality.' \n\nAlston spent two weeks traveling through California, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, and Washington D.C. and spoke with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. Contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound, Alston said.\n\nEarlier this week, a separate report examined mortality for the U.S. and other wealthy nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for children from birth to age 19 from 1961 to 2010. From 2001 to 2010 the risk of death in the U.S. was 76% greater for infants and 57% greater for children ages 1 to 19, according to the study, Child Mortality In The US And 19 OECD Comparator Nations: A 50-Year Time-Trend Analysis, published in Health Affairs journal.\n\n(This story was republished.)
Gold prices gave up earlier lows on Wednesday to end higher for a fifth session, then eased back in electronic trading from their settlement shortly after the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book. The report, which offers a snapshot of domestic economic activity, said the pace of growth continues to be modest to moderate. The report comes ahead of the Fed's next monetary policy meeting, during which the central bank is expected to keep short-term interest rates steady. February gold gcg8 was at $1,338.30 an ounce in electronic trading. Prices had gained $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,339.20 an ounce for the session, their highest since Sept. 8, according to FactSet data.
Gold prices bounced back from earlier losses on Friday to finish modestly higher. The precious metal stretched its streak of gains to an eleventh session and tallied a weekly gain of roughly 1% as some downbeat U.S. economic data helped feed expectations for a slower Federal Reserve interest-rate hike policy. February gold gcg8 rose 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,322.30 an ounce, marking another finish at the highest level since mid-September. The weekly gain was also gold's fourth such rise in a row.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a fresh £4.6 billion ($6.2 billion) support package for struggling U.K. businesses, just hours after the government imposed a third lockdown in the country to curb a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.\n\nBusinesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nUnder the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid February, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.\n\nThe new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the U.K., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.\n\nRead: Third national lockdown confirmed as new variant spreads across England\n\nThe new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.\n\nThe new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.\n\nSunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.\n\nNews of the cash injection lifted shares in pub groups Marston's MARS, -2.23% and Mitchells & Butlers MAB, -2.87% , which rose 2.39% and 2.43% respectively in London trading on Tuesday morning. Restaurant Group RTN, -1.50% , which operates 350 restaurants and pubs across the U.K. including the Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama chains, saw its stock rise 3.69%.\n\nRead: European markets slide as new lockdown measures set to take effect in the U.K. and Germany\n\nBusiness leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.\n\n This is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills  — Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality\n\nWhile this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality.\n\nTo address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% VAT [value-added tax] rate, she added.\n\nThe U.K.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by CGA and UKHospitality published in December.\n\nAdam Marshall, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said on Twitter TWTR, +1.37% that ministers need to set out a clear support package for the whole of 2021 — not just until spring — to help businesses of all shapes and sizes survive this difficult and uncertain year.\n\nRoger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.\n\nRead: Europe hopes next COVID stimulus will be the last
Good news for payday lenders and the mortgage industry. Bad news for consumers.\n\nThe temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has announced a new plan for the agency that seems to confirm the fears of consumer advocates.\n\nWe have committed to fulfill the bureau's statutory responsibilities, but go no further, he said in the new five-year strategic plan he unveiled Monday. He said it should serve as a bulwark against the misuse of our unparalleled powers. Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other Republicans have frequently said the CFPB is too powerful.\n\nThe CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. It will continue to adhere to its mission as laid out by Dodd-Frank, Mulvaney said: It will regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under the Federal consumer financial laws and educate and empower consumers to make better informed financial decisions.\n\nBut consumer advocates have worried since Mulvaney was appointed by President Donald Trump to take over the bureau that as director, he would favor companies over consumers. During its near seven-year history, the CFPB has taken on everything from the prepaid card industry to the mortgage servicing industry. (Richard Cordray, the previous head of the CFPB, was appointed during the Barack Obama administration.)\n\nThe latest plan shows Mulvaney is clearly working from the outside and the inside to destroy the CFPB and cripple its ability to protect consumers from financial predators, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.\n\nLatest evidence that the CFPB is losing its teeth\n\nMulvaney wrote in an op-ed published in January The Wall Street Journal that the bureau will no longer push the envelope. When it comes to enforcement, we will focus on quantifiable and unavoidable harm to the consumer, he wrote. If we find that it exists, you can count on us to pursue the appropriate remedies vigorously. If it doesn't, we won't go looking for excuses to bring lawsuits.\n\nMulvaney wrote that the bureau previously believed we were the good guys and the financial-service industry was the bad guys, but that will change, he said.\n\nA database with hundreds of thousands of complaints is at risk\n\nConsumer advocates are also concerned that the CFPB will get rid of the database of complaints related to current investigations, which allows the public to air complaints publicly. It also provided a direct way for the public to engage with the CFPB's activities.\n\nThe database contains hundreds of thousands of complaints filed by consumers about issues ranging from predatory debt collectors to errors on credit reports. Republicans have argued that the database shouldn't be public, while consumer advocates say the public list of complaints is an important tool for consumers.\n\nA public database has been a powerful mechanism for keeping financial predators accountable to consumers, Melissa Stegman, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C., told MarketWatch. Pulling the complaints behind a cloak of secrecy would help let unscrupulous companies get away with mistreating consumers.\n\nPayday lenders targeting vulnerable borrowers may regain more power\n\nMulvaney announced in January the CFPB may reconsider a rule Cordray implemented for payday lenders that was designed to protect consumers and limit the amount lenders are allowed to loan them, if they do not meet certain borrowing criteria.\n\nDennis Shaul, the CEO of the Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group that includes payday lenders, said he was pleased. The bureau's rule was crafted on a pre-determined, partisan agenda that failed to demonstrate consumer harm from small-dollar loans, ignored unbiased research and data, and relied on flawed information to support its rulemaking, he said.\n\nBut that's not good news for consumers, especially low-income households who often turn to payday lenders who have charged interest rates of up to 400%, Frisch said. There is no reason to delay implementation of this rule — unless you are more concerned with the needs of payday lenders than you are with the interests of the consumers these financial bottom-feeders prey upon, he told MarketWatch.\n\nStill, the CFPB's payday lending rules were complex, amounting to more than 1,000 pages, said Nick Clements, the co-founder of personal finance company MagnifyMoney, who previously worked in the credit industry. Although payday lenders can indeed cause borrowers financial distress, I do think there are some fair criticisms of the CFPB in terms of excessive complexity, he said.\n\nMulvaney requested zero dollars for his second-quarter budget\n\nIn January, Mulvaney requested zero dollars in his second-quarter budget request and said the agency has enough money for now.\n\nThe bureau already had $177 million in reserves, enough to cover the $145 million the bureau projected it would need during the second quarter, he said. I see no practical reason for such a large reserve, Mulvaney wrote in his funds request to the Federal Reserve, since I am informed that the board has never denied a bureau request for funding and has always delivered requested funds in a timely fashion.\n\nBut that request, some argue, could be a sign that the bureau is preparing to slow down. This is the latest chapter in Mulvaney's long campaign to undermine and completely dismantle the consumer bureau, wrote Debbie Goldstein, the executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C. She said requesting zero dollars sent the message that its work of defending consumers is not worth a penny.\n\nMulvaney and Cordray trade insults over the CFPB's future\n\nCordray struck back against Mulvaney in January, saying on Twitter that the op-ed shows more retreat … from current squatter leadership.\n\nThe fish rots from the head down, he wrote.\n\nMulvaney's op-ed and recent statements have alarmed some consumer advocates. I don't think anybody in their right mind would say they believe consumers need less protecting, and who really needs help is banks, predators and financial bad actors, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.\n\nThe new leadership has taken over at a time when consumers are struggling with credit-card, auto loan and student loan debt.\n\nWhat has the CFPB actually done for you?\n\nIn January 2017, the CFPB sued Navient Corp., the largest servicer of federal and private student loans in the U.S., in connection with creating obstacles for borrowers to repay their debts. The attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington have also sued Navient. (A spokeswoman for Navient said the cases are still pending and said no ruling has been made on the facts in any of those three states. She pointed to a lengthy company statement on the cases, which say that the allegations were unfounded.)\n\nThe agency fined Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% $100 million in September 2016 for alleged illegal practices including opening as many as two million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' knowledge. (Wells Fargo did not confirm or deny the charges but agreed to pay the fine and later fired more than 5,000 employees because of improper sales practices.) At the time, Republicans said the CFPB acted slowly on the Wells Fargo case.\n\nStruggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhy should you care about the change in direction?\n\nIn the few months since his November 2017 appointment, Mulvaney has already reversed some key actions taken by his predecessor, and yet many Americans may not have noticed. At least, not yet.\n\nThe CFPB has had some major wins against the financial services industry in recent years, but a majority of Americans appear to be unaware. More than 80% of people said they did not know enough about the CFPB to form an opinion of it, in a 2017 survey by the credit-card website CreditCards.com. (Since then, more people likely know about the CFPB because of recent controversies, Frisch said.)\n\nBut those same people indicated they would in theory support an agency like the CFPB, if they knew it existed. Some 80% of respondents in the CreditCards.com survey said they were in favor of having a federal government agency whose goal is to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and take action against companies who break the law. The irony? That description CreditCards.com took from the CFPB's mission statement, without naming the agency.\n\nUnder Trump, the CFPB wants to cut down on corporate red tape\n\nThe CFPB regarded as an unencumbered rulemaking and rule writing, Clements said. I think you'll see less, not more from the CFPB going forward.\n\nThe logic: If companies are burdened by expensive investigations, they may have to pass their costs onto consumers through their products, said Joe Jacquot, a partner at the law firm Foley & Lardner, based in Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nSpecifically, Mulvaney may look closely at the definition of abusive and specify how the bureau and attorneys general should regulate companies, said Nick Gess, a principal at Morgan Lewis, a law firm based in Washington, D.C. Despite what some argue, most institutions want to comply with the law.\n\nCurrently, the CFPB can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, Jacquot said. State attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.
What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business?\n\nIf you're a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don't:\n\nProfit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations.\n\nMicrolenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses.\n\nMany microlenders and nonprofits provide pro bono consulting and training, including helping small businesses build credit.\n\nGood options for nonprofit financing\n\nBelow, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit.\n\nWhen considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions.\n\nNonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender.\n\nYou see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn't a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, 'We're here.…We're more affordable.' \n\nTop U.S. microlenders\n\nThe Aspen Institute's FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program's 2014 survey, the most recent data available.\n\nGrameen America\n\nGrameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million\n\nLiftFund\n\nSan Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million\n\nOpportunity Fund\n\nCalifornia-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have a median household income of $31,000 a year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million\n\nAccion New Mexico\n\nAccion New Mexico offers small-business loans from $1,000 to $1 million in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas. The nonprofit also provides business counseling and marketing support and sponsors educational events. It's part of the Accion U.S. Network, which also has major chapters in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The international Accion nonprofit offers financing services and assistance, including microloans, in 32 countries.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $8.9 million\n\nJustine Petersen\n\nJustine Petersen, which is based in St. Louis, offers small-business loans, typically of less than $10,000. The nonprofit also finances businesses in rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Intermediary Relending Program and originates loans of up to $150,000 as part of the SBA's Community Advantage Program.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $8.4 million\n\nTop SBA nonprofit lenders\n\nAside from its signature 7(a) term loans, the SBA issues low-cost small-business financing through a network of nonprofits.\n\nThe SBA Microloan Program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. The SBA Community Advantage Program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital. The federal agency guarantees up to 85% of Community Advantage financing.\n\nHere are the top five nonprofits in the SBA programs based on total loan amount disbursed to small businesses in 2015, the most recent data available:\n\nCDC Small Business Finance Corp.\n\nCDC Small Business Finance Corp. offers different types of financing for new and expanding businesses in California, Arizona and Nevada, including SBA Community Advantage loans of between $20,000 and $250,000. It also issues SBA commercial real-estate loans, known as the SBA 504 loans, for clients planning to buy an existing building or build a new facility.\n\nSBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $11.7 million\n\nValley Economic Development Corp.\n\nValley Economic Development Corp. specializes in small-business loans and microfinancing for entrepreneurs who don't qualify for loans from traditional banks. It's based in Los Angeles but also operates in other states, including Nevada, Illinois and New York. Aside from the SBA Community Advantage program, it participates in other small-business financing programs, including the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, the National African-American Small-Business Loan Fund and the National Microfinance Network.\n\nSBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $9.7 million\n\nEmpire State Certified Development Corp.\n\nEmpire State Certified Development Corp. is part of the New York Business Development Corp., a major SBA lender. It was the top SBA Community Advantage lender in 2014. Empire State CDC also participates in the SBA commercial loan program.\n\nSBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.6 million\n\nMain Street Launch\n\nMain Street Launch, previously known as OBDC Small Business Finance, serves clients in the San Francisco Bay Area. It provides small-business loans of $10,000 to $250,000 that can be used for such expenses as equipment purchase, inventory or working capital.\n\nSBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.4 million\n\nLiftFund\n\nLiftFund, listed above among top U.S. microlenders, also offers SBA Community Advantage loans of $50,000 to $250,000 to businesses in low- to moderate-income communities in 13 states. Business owners can also qualify if more than 50% of their full-time workforce is low-income or if their employees live in areas designated as low- to moderate-income communities.\n\nSBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $6.6 million\n\nOther notable nonprofits\n\nKiva U.S.\n\nKiva U.S. is a part of Kiva, a nonprofit working in more than 80 countries. To receive an interest-free microloan through Kiva U.S., borrowers first must have friends and family members lend to the venture. This helps establish the borrower's creditworthiness. Once that happens, Kiva opens the loan to its lenders for funding.\n\nPacific Community Ventures\n\nPacific Community Ventures is a San Francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in California. You need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. However, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, PCV may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements.\n\nExcelsior Growth Fund\n\nExcelsior Growth Fund offers online loans of up to $100,000 for approved borrowers in less than five days and funding of up to $500,000 through its ImpactLoan program. The lender deals with borrowers who typically wouldn't qualify for traditional financing because their company is a startup or has poor credit. Through affiliates, it also provides SBA 7(a) and Community Advantage loans.\n\nBusiness Center for New Americans\n\nBusiness Center for New Americans provides financing of between $500 and $50,000 to small businesses in New York City. Borrowers must be in the retail, light manufacturing, restaurant or service industry, and existing businesses must have at least three to six months of verifiable revenue, according to the organization. Brand-new companies must present a startup budget.\n\nFor other small-business financing, compare options on NerdWallet's small-business loans tool page.\n\nMore from NerdWallet
In his State of the Union address, President Trump said there has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. But the new 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its accompanying report says that isn't so for low-income Americans.\n\nThe system is, by just about all measures, stacked against those with low incomes and low wealth for the benefit of the wealthiest, says the report from the nonpartisan but left-leaning Prosperity Now nonprofit, which provides research and recommendations regarding Americans with limited incomes.\n\nOne example: low-income people are ineligible for federal programs such as SNAP (food stamps) and TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) if they amass even modest savings, the report noted. Prosperity Now calls policies like this a roadblock on the path to saving.\n\nWhat the 2018 Prosperity Now scorecard found\n\nThe 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its report, Whose Bad Choices? How Policy Precludes Prosperity and What We Can Do About It, also make the argument that the U.S. economic system and policies of the Trump administration and Congress are stacked against people of color.\n\nWe've heard more rhetoric lately about [low-income] people making 'bad choices' or being 'irresponsible with money' and that's been the direction policy has been going,' said Kasey Wiedrich, director of applied research at Prosperity Now. We wanted to attack that. One example of the rhetoric: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) recently said lower-income Americans are just spending every darn penny they have whether it's on booze or women or movies.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley. Getty\n\nIn reality, however, the Prosperity Now report said, the dominant narrative about low-wealth people is nothing but a series of myths. Poor choices, the analysts there say, aren't why people are poor.\n\nRead: Booze, women or movies? What taxpayers are really spending their money on...\n\nThe 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard reviewed 115 outcome and policy measures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see how well residents are faring in five categories, and how much progress each state has made in adopting policies in them toward building a path to prosperity for all its residents. The categories: financial assets and income; businesses and jobs; homeownership and housing; health care and education.\n\nBest and worst states in the scorecard\n\nThe top five states, starting with the best: Vermont, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Minnesota and Utah. The bottom states, starting with the worst: Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Nevada and New Mexico and Alabama, which tied.\n\nWiedrich said the states with the lowest Scorecard rankings typically have the highest rates of low-wage jobs, lower credit scores and households struggling with incomes. Also, she added, these states tend to have less of a safety net. As a result, a financial emergency may hit their residents harder.\n\nLow-wage jobs are a chief reason so many low-income Americans have trouble making ends meet these days, according to Wiedrich.\n\nThis year's Scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low-wage occupations — ones that don't pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line. And, Prosperity Now's researchers say, even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 (from 9.6% to 4.5%), the rate of low-wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 (to 25.6%) and is still higher than in 2010 (when the rate was 21.5%).\n\nWeidrich concedes that there's been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago. In addition to the falling unemployment rate (just 3% for people 55+), there are the rising stock market (until the past few days), increasing wages — up 2.9% in the past year — rising median net worth and a drop in the number of Americans without health insurance (something which may change with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate).\n\nWhat to do in your 40s to retire a millionaire\n\nSome economic improvements, but 'not a panacea for all'\n\nBut, Wiedrich is quick to add, it's still not a panacea for all.\n\nAlthough the median net worth has been rising more for people of color than for whites, the unemployment rate is still more than twice as high for blacks (7.7%) than for whites (3.5%).\n\nAnd roughly half of renters (46% of white renters and 54% of renters of color) are what Prosperity Now calls cost-burdened — they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. That lowers their ability to save to buy a home, said Wiedrich. The homeownership figure in America has not really moved.\n\nDon't miss: Many older Americans are living a desperate, nomadic life\n\nProsperity Now argues that the 2017 tax law and a wave of deregulation by the Trump administration and Congress are helping the wealthiest Americans and corporations far more than people with low incomes.\n\nThe group's report cites a Tax Policy Center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a Pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.\n\nWhat the Prosperity Now report doesn't mention, however, is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) and doubled the child-care tax credit (to as much as $2,000 per qualifying child). Both changes stand to help low-income Americans.\n\nWhat the debt figures say\n\nFor the first time, this year's Prosperity Now Scorecard included data on Americans' levels of personal debt and their debt management. Both have been improving, overall — but there are a few debt trends going in the wrong direction.\n\nOn the plus side, median credit card debt fell 6.5% from $2,397 in the second quarter of 2010 to $2,241 in the second quarter of 2017, adjusted for inflation. And the percentage of consumers with delinquent credit card debt decreased from 11.7% of borrowers in 2010 to 8.4% in 2017.\n\nBut student loan debt is a growing problem: Median student loan debt increased by 21.4% between 2010 and 2017, from $14,588 to $17,711. The percentage of student loan borrowers who are delinquent (15.8%) is nearly twice the percentage of delinquent credit card borrowers. Among those over 55 with student loan debt, 12.3% are severely delinquent.\n\nAlso, the report noted, many households of color are dealing with debt issues. Student loan debt typically haunts students of color for much longer than other students, it said. Households of color are also more likely to be turned down for loans and are more vulnerable to fees and predatory products than white households.\n\nAn Urban Institute study of 60 U.S. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non-white neighborhoods, which can cost families of color $100 or more each month on a mortgage. And the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances found that African-American households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments.\n\nAll in all, Wiedrich said, Americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. Their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. Also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said Wiedrich.\n\nStates expanding the earned income tax credit\n\nA few states, however, have recently adopted policies — or are working to do so — that could help low-income people on the path to prosperity.\n\nFor example, Hawaii, Montana and South Carolina established state earned income tax credits; California and Illinois expanded their credits to cover more working families. These tax credits, like the federal anti-poverty one, put money in the pockets of low- and moderate-income working people so they can keep more of what they earn. Currently, 29 states have a state earned income tax credit.\n\nHelping Americans save for retirement\n\nAnd, although the Trump administration and Congress recently made it tougher for states to set up retirement plans for residents whose employers don't offer them — a short-sighted policy, Weidrich said — a few states are creating them anyway.\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon have done this; Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, the Prosperity Now report said, are pursuing similar strategies. That could be especially helpful for low-income people; 77% of the lowest-earning workers lack access to an employer-provided retirement plan.\n\n'Lifting citizens to prosperity'\n\nPresident Trump declared in his State of the Union speech that we can lift our citizens… from poverty to prosperity. But, Prosperity Now maintains, to make that happen, more states and federal policymakers need to do more — especially now, when times are good for so many.\n\nSee: Got $1 million to retire? Here's how long it will last in every U.S. state\n\nAt some point, the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from today's economic gains will be hardest hit, said Wiedrich.
International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.62% said Tuesday that it has appointed Gary Cohn to serve as vice chairman of its board of directors. Cohn will also join the company's executive leadership team. Cohn served as assistant for economic policy to President Donald Trump and director of the National Economic Council from January 2017 to April 2018. He previously worked as the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.95% . In a release, Cohn cheered IBM's focused growth strategy that will capitalize on the enormous opportunity in hybrid cloud and AI. IBM shares are up 0.7% in Tuesday morning trading. They've gained 3.1% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% has risen 9.7%.
With a Trump presidency rapidly bearing down on Wall Street, market participants are scrambling to get in position for at least the next four years. David Einhorn is prepared for a few scenarios including the possibility of a recession.\n\nIn a letter to clients dated Jan. 17, Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, offered up a few insights into his thinking as Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.
Federal Reserve officials saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time, according to minutes of the December meeting released Wednesday.\n\nThe account of the meeting suggest the era of a predictable and boring U.S. central bank may be over.\n\nBy a unanimous vote on Dec. 14, the Fed raised its federal-funds range by a quarter-percentage point to 0.50%-0.75%, its second rate increase in a decade. At the same time, Fed officials said economic conditions will warrant only gradual increases in the federal-funds rate. In the so-called dot plot, Fed officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases in 2017 instead of two seen in September.\n\nMinutes of the meeting show many Fed officials thought this gradual policy path was under threat.\n\nFed officials pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, the minutes said.\n\nU.S. stocks saw little reaction to the latest Fed minutes, after the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.46% closed Tuesday with a nearly 27% advance from its February lows.\n\nThe biggest risk was that the unemployment rate might drop sharply below the 4.5% jobless rate viewed as the longer-run normal level below which might spark inflation.\n\nThe unemployment rate is almost at that level having dropped to 4.6% in November.\n\nMany Fed officials judged the risk of a sizable undershooting of the normal jobless rate had increased somewhat and that the Federal Open Market Committee might need to raise the federal-funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pressures, according to the minutes.\n\nSome Fed officials saw this as a modest risk and said that a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate might help return inflation to the Fed's 2% target. But this seemed to be a minority view.\n\nSeveral Fed voting members noted that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust the FOMC's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possibility that a less gradual pace of increases could become appropriate, the minutes said.\n\nA couple of officials wanted to do away with the Fed's gradual rate hike pledge altogether.\n\nSeveral Fed officials noted that a faster pace of rate increases could also have implications for the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.\n\nChairwoman Janet Yellen has said the Fed would hold the balance sheet steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from mortgage-backed securities until the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.\n\nIt was too early to know what President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy might entail, and how this might alter the economic outlook, Fed members said.\n\nAlmost all Fed officials indicated that upside risks to their growth forecasts had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.\n\nAll in all, many participants emphasized that the greater uncertainties about these policies made it more challenging to communicate to the public about the likely path of the federal funds rate, the minutes said.
Congressional Democrats on Wednesday introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThe bill was introduced at a press conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who may seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThe middle class is the backbone of our country, and the middle class and those who aspire to it are those we are here to work for, Pelosi said.\n\nWe are living today in an American economy which is doing very well for the people on top, not so well for working families, Sanders said.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has been at $7.25 since July 2009. The Raise the Wage Act would only gradually lift that wage, reaching $15 per hour by 2024. It would then index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth. It would also phase out subminimum wages for tipped, youth and disabled workers.\n\nThe bill was introduced with 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors. It is highly unlikely to become law under a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nMany states have already been lifting their minimum wages above the federal minimum. Some 5.3 million workers started receiving higher pay starting Jan. 1, according to an analysis released by the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.\n\nIn 2017, over a half-million workers received the federal minimum wage, and another 1.8 million workers made below that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Treasurys weakened Friday, pushing the two-year yield above 2%, after a larger-than-expected rise in a key consumer-price measure underlined rising inflation expectations and dampened appetite for U.S. government paper.\n\nWhat did Treasurys do?\n\nThe yield on the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , sensitive to changes in monetary policy expectations, rose 2.9 basis points to 2.001%, its highest finish since September. 2008. That contributed to a 4.1 basis point climb this week.\n\nThe yield for the 10-year benchmark note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% rose 2 basis points to 2.551%, extending a 7.5 basis point weeklong rise. While, the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% slipped 0.9 basis point to 2.855%, but saw a 4.3 basis points rise for the week.
While the partial government shutdown is largely bad news for U.S. companies, payday lenders look set for a boost.\n\nWe're now getting to the point where federal employees are going to need some kind of short-term loan in some cases, said federal budget expert Stan Collender.\n\nIn cases where these employees can't turn to family or friends, companies that provide payday loans are going to benefit a little bit, because there's going to be a request for funds, said Collender, known for his Budget Guy blog.\n\nAbout 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without wages thanks to the shutdown, now in its 21th day. They are missing out on paychecks for the first time on Friday, which otherwise generally would have been payday.\n\nRelated:More banks are trying to get a piece of the payday loan pie\n\nAnd see:Four in 10 can't cover an emergency expense of $400, Fed survey finds\n\nBeyond conventional payday lenders, some credit unions that serve government employees are offering loans to affected workers during the shutdown, and they're not necessarily charging the high interest that's usually associated with cash advances. The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.\n\nSuch offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.\n\nThe payday lending industry's trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, didn't respond to requests for comment. Lenders World Acceptance Corp. WRLD, +1.06% and Enova International Inc. ENVA, -8.25% also didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's possible that tax-preparation companies could see more demand for refund-advance loans, Collender said. The shutdown has threatened to delay the actual refunds, though the Trump administration said Monday that they would go out as usual.\n\nRead more:3 ways to protect your finances if you're a federal employee not getting paid\n\nFor the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to Collender. He said: You see mostly losers here. Coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.\n\nThere is incredible uncertainty relating to the TSA, and as that relates to air travel and tourism, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research and Trading, referring to reports of longer lines at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints as agents who aren't getting paid call out sick. (In the wake of such reports, the TSA said 90% of U.S. passengers waited less than 15 minutes on Sunday, while a big pilots union has called for an end to the shutdown because it's hurting safety and efficiency.)\n\nSome airlines have voiced concerns about delays in the certification of new aircraft and slowdowns in the training of pilots and air traffic controllers, said Clayton Allen, a Height Capital Markets analyst.\n\nOne of the things that is maybe not appreciable now, but will have an impact as time goes on, is the impact on air traffic control, he told MarketWatch. We have a shortage of air traffic controllers, so slowing down the training process today means that a year from now, six month from now, you're not going to have as many air traffic controllers as you thought you would.\n\nThe aviation industry is hurt in particular because two key government entities that it must deal with are affected by the shutdown — the Homeland Security Department and the Federal Aviation Administration, Allen added.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is also hit by the government closure, the Height analyst noted.\n\nThat's not really a positive for financial markets SPX, -0.16% , because not having a regulator in your office doesn't mean you can run hog wild. It just means you can't get sign-off on things, Allen said. I kind of struggle to find people who are winning in this scenario, from a corporate perspective.\n\nThe shutdown is disrupting the initial-public-offering process and may cause delays in some of the bigger IPOs expected in 2019. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for big business in Washington, has called for an end to the closure, saying it's hearing every day from businesses across the country about how the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.\n\nThis report was first published on Jan. 8, 2019.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the Federal Reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the December 15-16 meeting, released Wednesday. Fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. Going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.
Before heading to Davos, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was asked about the wave of companies who are saying they are increasing wages or bonuses due to the recently enacted tax cuts.\n\nYou know, look, if they had their money in their coffers, they could have done it last year, the year before, the year before, the year before, Cohn said Tuesday.\n\nAnd we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the U.S. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. So I think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.\n\nA 100% correlation? Here's a look at what the companies have said and what they've done.\n\nThe first item is to look at what companies have said. The Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. The benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nA few things become clear when looking at the list. One is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. A notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nWhat kind of bonus was the typical worker already getting?\n\nThere isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. Labor Department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. Data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.\n\nIf you apply a ratio derived from an employer survey, to one derived from employee data (yes, yes, that's not terrific practice), you arrive at an average annual bonus of $1,426.\n\nThat should be read as the average bonus every worker is receiving. Some obviously get nothing, while some make thousands more. Nearly 40% of private-sector workers are eligible for a bonus, but some smaller percentage actually get them.\n\nNow, some of the companies made pains to say that they were paying a bonus above and beyond what they previously were intending. Short of truth serum, it's hard to really know.\n\nBut employers are directing these bonuses to workers who aren't typically receiving them. Employers have been paying out bonuses equal to 4.7% of wages and salaries for management, professional and related fields, but just 0.8% for service employees. The announcements make clear the bonuses are for the rank and file, not management.\n\nThe next question to ask is whether the companies are making the announcement because of the tax cuts, or whether they're dressing up what they had already been doing to curry favor from a particularly sensitive administration.\n\nAT&T T, -0.46% , for instance, had already agreed to the bonus in talks with its union, when it made its announcement on Dec. 20. That said, the Communications Workers of America told ThinkProgress — a website of a left-wing policy group — that AT&T agreed to the bonuses after the CWA argued employees should get the $4,000 wage increase that the White House promised the tax cut would provide. That actually argues in favor of the Cohn point — the tax cuts led to an economic environment resulting in increased pay for workers.\n\nThe fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. AT&T, which has been trying to win support for its Time Warner US:TWX merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like Bank of America BAC, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like Bank of Advance and Flushing Financial Corp., FFIC, +0.62% announcing them. Several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.\n\nThe last word here on tax cuts and worker pay goes to Cohn's former employer, Goldman Sachs. In a research note, the firm looked at both the corporate PR announcements and the minimum wage hikes in 18 states.\n\nIn practice, we expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on average hourly earnings — as it excludes irregular bonuses — and only a marginal boost to the employment cost index — as irregular bonuses are smoothed out, according to a note written by economist Daan Struyven.\n\nIrregular bonuses may provide a more meaningful lift to fourth-quarter compensation per hour, but it will likely also be offset by potential individual income shifting. More significant effects from tax reform seem more likely in the next few quarters via a tighter labor market.\n\nIn other words, no, these PR announcements aren't really evidence of the economy getting better for workers in a meaningful way. But tax reform may yet make things better. It's too early to tell.\n\nHere's what is real — what companies are giving to investors. According to data from TrimTabs, 23 companies have announced stock buybacks worth a cumulative $33.8 billion since the tax cuts became law, and the firm expects announcements to pick up as more companies report earnings in coming weeks.
Bank of America and other major consumer-facing lenders are assessing the use of credit cards to purchase bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which could result in restrictions or limits.\n\nA Bank of America BAC, +2.61% spokeswoman in San Francisco told MarketWatch that the bank was reviewing its policies related to the purchase of such crypto assets as bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.68% but declined to discuss further.\n\nCitigroup Inc. C, +0.33% said it hasn't changed its policy but will continue to monitor this evolving space, in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the bank's planning who declined to be identified.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Capital One Financial Corp. COF, -2.54% banned customers from using credit cards to purchase bitcoin or coins on the Ethereum blockchain, citing limiting mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss and volatility.\n\nAttempts to reach Capital One for comment were not immediately successful.\n\nBanks taking a harder look at the use of debt to buy digital assets come as bitcoin and its rivals have ballooned in popularity in recent months. The fervor around virtual coins has been compared with tulip mania, with as prominent a banker as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s CEO Jamie Dimon at one point describing the craze over bitcoin and its brethren as a fraud and speculative bubble that will end badly. A call to J.P. Morgan about its credit-card policy toward bitcoin weren't immediately returned.\n\nRead:Dimon's many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 last December but has since cooled considerably amid a wave of heightened scrutiny from regulators in Asia and a domestic intent to tamp down speculation. Bitcoin has lost about half its value since its peak last year but is still up 1,025% since the end of 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 34% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% has gained 27% over the period.\n\nThe banking sector might be particular wary of bitcoin because digital assets, many of which run on decentralized, distributed-ledger technologies, have been associated with money laundering and criminal activity.\n\nStill bitcoin has gained wider acceptance on Wall Street with the CME Group Inc. and the Cboe Global Markets kicking off trading last month in cash-settled bitcoin futures.\n\nMost recently a single bitcoin was trading at $10,975, off 3.7%, according to research and data site Coindesk.com, while futures on the Cboe US:XBTG8 for February were off 2.4% at $10,930 and January CME futures US:BTCF8 were down 2.1% at $10,880.
Gold settled higher on Wednesday, as a benchmark dollar index dropped to a three-month low. Prices for the precious metal then extended gains into electronic trading shortly after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting revealed that some Federal Reserve members wanted to hold policy steady in December.

'i am doubling down, because as prices move further away from trend, at accelerating speed and with growing speculative fervor, of course my confidence as a market historian increases that this is indeed the late stage of a bubble. a bubble that is beginning to look like a real humdinger.' \n\nthat is jeremy grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at boston-based money manager grantham, mayo, van otterloo & co., in a research report dated tuesday after a particularly withering year for his investment outfit in 2020.\n\ngrantham's bearish view on valuations was reflected in gmo's investment strategy which trailed the s&p 500 index spx, +0.29% , according to a report by bloomberg news late last year which noted that clients had pulled $2.2 billion from the fund as of november 2020.\n\nlast year was a remarkable year for risk assets in the face of a global viral epidemic that left equity indexes initially reeling in the spring, only to stage a spectacular rebound in the ensuing months as fiscal and monetary policy contributed to an economic recovery.\n\nthe s&p 500 spx, +0.29% and the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% posted impressive gains in 2020, despite an initial bear market a decline of at least 20% and a recovery from those march lows of over 60%, while the nasdaq composite index comp, +0.40% surged more than 80% from its nadir.\n\nthe dow jones industrial average finished 2020 up 7.25% in 2020, while the s&p500 index gained 16.26% and the nasdaq composite returned 43.64%.\n\ngrantham however says that the market's bubblicious state has accelerated since he last declared values inflated and referenced a quote often attributed to famed economist john maynard keynes stipulating that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\n\nin grantham's words either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble.\n\nhe also mentions the surge in interest in electric-vehicle makers like tesla inc. tsla, +3.68% as evidence of the market's speculative fervor.\n\nthe most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears, he writes.\n\nwhat's a prudent investor to do with one of the legends of wall street signaling caution is warranted?\n\ngrantham says assets considered value, or trading at a discount based on some metric and emerging markets may be better bets in the near term. he said such bets go along with the greatest avoidance of u.s. growth stocks that your career and business risk will allow.\n\ndespite his recent challenges calling a top, grantham is worth paying attention to due to his prescient calls over the years. he said that stocks were overvalued in 2000 and again in 2007, anticipating those market downturns, the wall street journal reports. grantham also signaled that elements of the financial market had become unmoored from reality leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. Not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.\n\nCheck out how these seven went from small potatoes to success stories.\n\nThe Amazon AMZN, -3.44% head honcho landed a summer job in his teens as a grill man, flipping burgers at McDonald's.

The most challenging thing [while working at McDonald's] was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush.\n\nWarren Buffett: paperboy\n\nAt 13, Buffett woke up every day at 4:30 a.m. to deliver copies of the Washington Post. But he was a far cry from your average paperboy, taking an ambitious approach to his route that hints at the incredible drive and savvy he wields now.\n\nAccording to the biography The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, he brainstormed strategies to deliver his papers as fast as possible, sold calendars and magazine subscriptions on the side and took in $2,000 in two years. At 15, he hammered out a profit-share agreement with a farmer in Nebraska and invested $1,200 of those earnings in a 40-acre farm. So, uh, not exactly your average teen.\n\nEverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nMarissa Mayer: supermarket clerk\n\nWhere did the former Yahoo US:AABA CEO first learn the value of hard work?

I learned that speed mattered… The only way to be eligible to work an express lane was to do 40 items per minute consistently. I also learned a lot about family economics, how people make trade-offs and how people make decisions on something fundamental, like how to eat.\n\nMichael Bloomberg: parking lot attendant\n\nHailing from a middle-class family in Massachusetts, the billionaire businessman and former New York City mayor worked as a parking lot attendant to help pay for his tuition at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMaybe that's why he made traffic policy a hallmark pursuit as a politician. The MetroCard mayor pledged to commute to work via mass transit, promoted bike lanes and a bike-share program in NYC and created exclusive high-speed bus lanes. More recently, Bloomberg has emerged as a champion for global road safety, dedicating $250 million from his charitable foundation to improve conditions and promote bike and mass transit use around the world.\n\nBeyoncé: salon sweeper\n\nBeyoncé: sweeping floors.

I grow so much from…[having] a conversation with a woman who understands me, she's said about her time at the salon.\n\nDoug McMillon: Wal-Mart truck unloader\n\nDoug McMillon, CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Bloomberg\n\nHere's proof that you really can work your way from the ground up: As reported by Business Insider, Wal-Mart's CEO and president started at the company in high school, unloading trucks at a distribution center in his home state of Arkansas.\n\nPostcollege, he was hired as a buyer trainee while working his way through grad school. Armed with an M.B.A., he landed a position at the Bentonville, Ark. headquarters and rose quickly through the ranks as a buyer, merchandise manager and senior VP. He snagged a major promotion in 2006, when he was named CEO of Sam's Club, a Wal-Mart WMT, -1.31% subsidiary. Three years later, he was put in charge of Wal-Mart International, where he grew international sales by 29%. In 2014, he became the company's fifth CEO.\n\nShonda Rhimes: candy striper\n\nLong before Grey's Anatomy catapulted her into superstar producer territory, Rhimes was a candy striper—which directly influenced the creation of her first hit drama.\n\nIt felt like there were a thousand stories in every [hospital] room and there is something really great about that idea, she told People magazine. And then surgery, just the idea that you could hold a human being's heart in your hand and you are responsible for life or death… I felt like [doctors] were warriors. That was really intriguing for me.\n\nWord is still out on the inspiration behind McDreamy.
Congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.\n\nFor decades, earmarks paid for pet projects back in lawmakers' districts, with the tacit aim to earn those lawmakers votes. In turn, the awards encouraged legislators to vote for large spending bills. They have long been seen by many members of the public as well as some lawmakers as wasteful and distasteful, and they were banned in 2011.\n\nNow, following the 2020 election, House Democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland announced on Nov. 20 that the Appropriations Committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.\n\nAlthough the Senate has appeared more committed to its ban, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and other Senate Republicans and Democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.\n\nFederal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. Earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that X amount of money must be spent on Y project.\n\nBefore 2011, earmarks were regularly and – until 2007 – in increasingly large numbers inserted into appropriations and highway funding bills.\n\nWhile earmarks have been condemned as frivolous at best and corrupt at worst, research on their uses and effects paints a more complex picture of their dynamics. My own research, as well as that of Frances Lee, shows that such projects helped transportation committee leaders pass three massive highway bills, overcoming significant policy controversies.\n\n'Reeking of corruption'\n\nNevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018 called earmarks the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. To supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of Congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. And not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.\n\nSince 2018, many have argued for a return to earmarking to grease the wheels for appropriations bills. Pro-earmark arguments have come from members of Congress of both parties and President Donald Trump.\n\nThe current impetus among House Democrats also may be driven by their losses in the 2020 election. The Democrats' new majority is currently at 222, compared with 211 for the Republicans, with two seats still undecided.\n\nGiven that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. Earmarks could help endangered Democrats shore up their support among voters back home.\n\nHow to pass bills\n\nEfforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: Congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.\n\nIn the normal appropriations process, Congress would pass 12 individual spending bills each year, a process designed to give legislators a chance to examine the spending in each bill before voting.\n\nThe reality is far different.\n\nData compiled by the Pew Research Center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills Congress should have passed. Individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.\n\nInstead, Congress has funded government agencies in massive omnibus appropriations bills, and partial- and full-year continuing resolutions, making it virtually impossible for members to know what they were voting for.\n\nThis breakdown in the regular appropriations process coincides neatly with the earmark moratorium, although before the 2011 moratorium, the process did not always go smoothly.\n\nMy own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as Congress went from Democratic to Republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.\n\nPartisanship could undermine earmarks' effectiveness\n\nMy interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. Prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. Senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.\n\nAnother staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.\n\nThat staffer said, People have no shame. They vote no and take the dough.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how returning to pork-barrel spending would work today.\n\nFor earmarks to be effective tools, members might have to vote contrary to their own or their party's preferences. Their willingness to do so would undoubtedly depend partly on the electoral consequences.\n\nAs political scientist David Mayhew has argued, members believe that bringing home district benefits gives them something for which to claim credit, enhancing their chances for reelection and providing congressional leaders with leverage over their votes.\n\nThe evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.\n\nEarmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.\n\nBut there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward Democrats than Republicans. This is not entirely surprising, given that earmarks are consistent with Democrats' commitment to activist government, whereas for Republicans committed to minimizing the cost of government, bringing home earmarks could be painted as hypocritical.\n\nThese differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in Republican-controlled congresses.\n\n'Gateway drug'\n\nThe negative effects of earmarking for Republicans may have grown more powerful. Over the past two decades, critics of earmarks have framed them as egregious government waste.\n\nThe late Sen. John McCain, for example, called earmarks the gateway drug to corruption and overspending.\n\nBut overspending is in the eye of the beholder. At their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (Discretionary spending is money over which Congress has direct control, unlike Social Security or Medicare, for example.) As a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that Democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.\n\nEarmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.\n\nIn addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.\n\nAs Congress wrestles with the process of passing individual appropriations bills, congressional leaders are poised to once again allow earmarks in appropriations bills to ease the bills' passage and protect vulnerable Democrats at the polls.\n\nDiana Evans is a professor of political science at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. This was first published by The Conversation — The 'gateway drug to corruption and overspending' is returning to Congress – but are earmarks really that bad?
Years ago, you'd visit your grandparents in a gated community and think, I'd never want to live here.\n\nNow that you're nearing (or past) retirement, you think, I may move to a gated community.\n\nThat's the cycle of life.\n\nThe larger question is whether you'll thrive in these planned developments springing up around the country. The real estate brochures make them sound heavenly: gorgeous homes, no crime, fun activities. But problems might lurk behind the ritzy clubhouse, artificial lakes and stunning views.\n\nMany of these communities restrict residents to age 55 and up. That can attract older people who welcome the chance to kick back and relax with their own kind.\n\nFor many of them, this is the last time they're going to buy a home, said Michelle Ames, a real-estate broker in Frisco, Texas. They're looking to shelter in place, and they want to do it with lots of like-minded people.\n\nSurrounding yourself with neighbors in your age bracket might sound appealing—until you get to know them. The bevy of rules that govern gated communities can lead to bickering among residents who tattle on each other for minor infractions.\n\nRegulations can range from paint colors for your house to parking in front of it. In some cases, rules about house guests stipulate you can only host children for a limited time such as 90 days a year. And if you intend to generate rental income, some communities impose a one-month minimum to avoid Airbnb-like coming and going.\n\nBefore buying, know the rules and make sure you can live with them. The homeowners association maintains a compilation of do's and don'ts—often called CC&Rs [covenants, conditions and restrictions]—that you'll want to read.\n\nThere are a lot of rules and they exist for a reason, said Lisa Corbin, a recently divorced homeowner in her late 50s who moved into a gated community in La Quinta, Calif. Our CC&Rs are 3,000 pages. They cover everything from the plants and trees you can have to not keeping your garage door open.\n\nWhen house hunting last year, Corbin visited gated communities in Southern California's Coachella Valley. But rather than just meet with real-estate agents, she ventured on her own into clubhouses to chat with residents and solicit their input.\n\nI'd ask, 'What do you think of living here?' and people really opened up, she recalled. They might complain about a special assessment added to their homeowner dues to pay for roof repairs or the restrictive policy regarding the type and number of dogs you could have.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, you'll want to consider the monthly dues, what they cover and whether they're likely to go up. Well-run homeowner associations maintain fully funded reserves rather than relying on steep assessments from time to time to cover deferred maintenance and other costs.\n\nSafety is a big attraction, especially for single retirees who welcome the security of living in a gated enclave. But even if drivers can only enter through a central gate where a guard in a kiosk confirms their identity, perils remain.\n\nIn a gated community near me, a minivan was stolen out of a driveway when the thieves got in through a hole in a fence, Ames said. Unless you want to put concertina wire along the top of your wall, you can't be totally secure.\n\nIn some communities, residents volunteer on their neighborhood watch patrol by driving around the property. And homeowners may install home security systems as an added precaution.\n\nBut if architectural conformity appeals to you and you're tired of skateboarding kids and baby-strolling moms clogging your street, an age-55 and over gated community might make sense. And if you don't enjoy hiring a gardener, mowing your lawn or cursing speeders who plague your neighborhood, then a gated community can deliver the peace and quiet you covet.

I had been skeptical of the late December rally, however, each day this week the gold price has been pulling higher and the recovery is gathering pace, said Richard Perry, market analyst at Hantec Markets, in a note.\n\nI do though remain cautious with chasing gold too far higher as bear market rallies have been continually sold into over the past few months, he added.\n\nIn exchange-traded products, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, -0.58% rose 1.5%, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -1.72% gained 5.7% and the iShares Silver Trust SLV, -1.31% added 0.8%.\n\nMarch silver US:SIH7 advanced 8.5 cents, or 0.5%, to $16.637 an ounce on Thursday.\n\nApril platinum US:PLJ7 rose $28.80, or 3%, to $976 an ounce, while March palladium US:PAH7 shed 60 cents, or less th an 0.1%, to $738.20 an ounce.

Money managers and investors are hoping for the best when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump's potential to bring strong growth and inflation to the U.S. and abroad, but that doesn't mean they're ready to shift into full bull mode yet.\n\nThose are findings of the survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch released Tuesday, which has gathered up the opinions of some 176 chief investment officers, asset managers, economists and portfolio managers.\n\nAmong the highlights, investor expectations of global growth have improved to 2-year highs (net 62% from net 57% in December), while global inflation expectations remain elevated, and drew the fifth-highest reading on record (net 83% from net 84% last month).\n\nRead:Earnings? Stock investors should watch these 5 factors instead, Goldman says\n\nAhead of the U.S. presidential inauguration, investors are positioned for stronger growth and inflation, but are not willing to turn fully bullish with China-related risks on the horizon, said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist, in a press release accompanying the survey.\n\nThere are three specific risks that investors and money managers are or should be worried about, according to the January survey: trade war/protectionism (29%), U.S. policy error (24%) or a China yuan devaluation (15%), said the bank. Here's a chart showing how those risks stack up to other concerns:\n\nWhen it comes to a trade war, many regard Trump as a risk. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping lauded globalization and said no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. It wouldn't be far fetched to imagine those comments were made in response to promises from Trump to slap tariffs on Chinese goods to lift U.S. manufacturing.\n\nTrump, China diverge on new world order\n\nTrump complained in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last Friday that the Chinese yuan USDCNY, had become too weak and the dollar too strong, saying U.S. companies can't compete with China due to that currency imbalance. The comments weighed on the dollar and stocks Tuesday.\n\n\n\nRead:Trump sends shivers through stock market on 'too strong' dollar comments\n\nMoney managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the long-dollar trade is by far the most crowded right now:\n\nToo dollar-long\n\nHere's a chart that lays out how global fund managers' positions have changed in the latest month.
The Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.01% strengthened against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda affirmed the central bank would continue to support the Japanese economy through monetary easing. Kuroda also said that inflation was finally getting close to the BOJ's target of 2% and that there would be a slight pickup in inflation expectations. Japan is understood to have the loosest approach to monetary policy among the developed economies, and is expected to be one of the last to join the trend of policy normalization. The dollar last bought ¥108.95, down from ¥109.41. The pair touched its lowest level since September on Thursday.
President Trump has said American workers have been front and center of his campaign and his presidency. The agenda I will layout this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda, it's the agenda of the American people. Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers, the president said in his State of the Union speech on Feb. 5\n\n 'Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers.' \n\nThe U.S. gained 304,000 new jobs in January, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.\n\nUnder a host of new laws that will go into effect in 2019, however, states are taking it upon themselves to change employees' lives, from how much they earn, to their comfort and security in the workplace, to their ability to plan for their futures.\n\nA handful of states have increased the minimum wage to between $12 and $15, and others have implemented regulations that focus on preventing sexual harassment, saving for retirement and fostering a more gender-diverse work environment.\n\n 'With the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation.'  — —Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project\n\nWith the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation, said Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for workers' rights.\n\nSee: Feel like your workplace is especially depressing? Scientists found out why\n\nHere are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:\n\nIncreasing minimum wage\n\nNineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in January, with many raising it to $15 an hour. Another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nStates that increased minimum wage at the beginning of the year include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Washington.\n\n 'Cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida.'  — —Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project\n\nCost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida, Sonn said. This will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.\n\nSee also:This is how many million U.S. workers will get a pay raise in the new year\n\nAttracting more workers\n\nVermont began its Remote Worker Grant Program, which reimburses workers who move to Vermont for expenses including relocation costs, computer software and broadband access. The program pays remote workers up to $5,000 every year, up to a total of $10,000, when they move to the state. Lawmakers created the program to help reverse the trend of an aging and declining population and to draw more tech workers.\n\nDon't miss:Ways your workplace wellness program could actually be making you fat\n\nNo perks for some fired government workers\n\nIllinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. As part of Senate Bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. It also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. The law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. Under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.\n\nThwarting sexual harassment\n\nA California law that went into effect on Jan. 1 prohibits secret settlement agreements pertaining to sexual harassment or sex discrimination. The legislation, which applies to public and private employers, allows victims to stay anonymous if they want to remain out of the public eye, but allows victims to pursue civil action.\n\n 'We've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years.'  — —Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center\n\nThe #MeToo movement, originally sparked by high-profile cases of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, quickly spread to other industries and has changed America's workplaces. Companies and policymakers are looking for solutions, Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center, told MarketWatch last year. We've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years, she said.\n\nCalifornia has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. Any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.\n\nAlso see: Sheryl Sandberg thinks the workplace is 'rigged' against women — but these steps could fix that\n\nAn eye on retirement\n\nA retirement crisis is looming in the country. Americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. States have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.\n\nCalifornia's program, called CalSavers, will open to all eligible workers this July. Oregon was the first state to implement its state-sponsored retirement program, and Illinois has also started its own program. More states are expected to implement or propose similar legislation in the coming years.
The investment boom that began in 2016 is fading fast, quashing the never-realistic hopes of Republicans that the corporate tax cut had permanently transformed the economy for the better.\n\nThere's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.\n\nA month ago, White House economist Kevin Hassett was insisting that everything was still going as planned. He declared that companies were investing more in equipment, software and facilities, enough to propel U.S. potential growth from an anemic 2% to a stellar 3% or more.\n\nAs he often is, Hassett was too cheery.\n\nNow, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.\n\nCapex plans scaled back\n\nThose four interrelated trends are weighing on aggregate demand in the U.S. and global economies, forcing companies to scale back their investment plans. It's already visible in the data and in surveys of business expectations.\n\nIt's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.\n\nThere are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.\n\nAlso read:The 15 U.S. companies that are investing the most in tomorrow's big ideas\n\nBusinesses invest when they believe demand for their products will rise. Right now, fewer companies are confident of that future revenue. Most of the leading indicators of demand are slumping as the new year begins.\n\nSurveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. The new orders component of the ISM manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in December. Company guidance, U.S. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: Companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.\n\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley say their capex plans index (which is based on the regional Fed surveys of capital-spending expectations) has fallen in eight of the past nine months to the lowest level in a year.\n\nThe continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said Morgan Stanley economist Molly Wharton in a note to clients.\n\nHard data also show that capital spending is softening. Real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. Core capital equipment orders and shipments slowed through November, and private nonresidential construction spending has also weakened.\n\nUnfortunately, the government shutdown means this key data isn't being reported or collected. It's never a good time to fly blind, doubly so now.\n\nImpact of oil prices\n\nThere's something else going on besides weak aggregate demand: The impact of oil prices on U.S. investment is underappreciated.\n\nIt used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. But since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.\n\nTraditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The analysis of the profitability of, say, an offshore drilling project doesn't depend on spot crude oil prices US:CLG9, but on prices expected for the duration of the project's life. Temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.\n\nBut producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.\n\nThat creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.\n\nOil accounted for all growth\n\nAfter a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.\n\nAlexander Arnon of the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in a blog post titled The Price of Oil is Now a Key Driver of Business Investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.\n\nMost oil investments aren't profitable if the price falls much below $50 a barrel. Dallas Federal Reserve\n\nUnfortunately, oil prices have fallen again. Oil prices, which were near $70 in October, fell to $43 in mid-December and are now around $52. That's right at the midpoint of profitability for most fracking projects, according to the Dallas Fed's Energy Survey.\n\nThe current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote Carpenter of UBS. Further declines in the price of West Texas Intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to U.S. GDP.\n\nManufacturers in the Dallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve districts have noticed, Morgan Stanley's Wharton points out. Declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the Dallas Fed in December. About half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.\n\nLikewise, oil and gas drilling activity in the Minneapolis Fed district slowed notably recently in response to a rapid decline in the price of crude oil, according to the latest Beige Book. An industry contact reported that expectations for capital expenditures in the Bakken oil patch have shifted downward dramatically.\n\nThe incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.\n\nFor instance, IHS Markit is predicting that U.S. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the IMF and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.\n\nThe U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.
To hear Brenda Robertson tell it, Georgia needs someone like Raphael Warnock in the Senate.\n\nIt was so important to get over here and do this today, Robertson, 68, told MarketWatch in an Election Day interview outside a polling station in Chatham County on Tuesday.\n\nRobertson, like other voters in her county and around the Peach State, was casting her ballot in pivotal elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate and thus how far President-elect Joe Biden can push his agenda.\n\nNow see: Betting markets and polls give edge to Democrats in Georgia's crucial Senate runoff elections\n\nTight contests are expected as Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Warnock are facing off against Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. If the Republicans win just one of the seats, they'll remain in the Senate majority and put a check on the agenda of Biden and the Democratic-run House of Representatives.\n\nChatham County, with Savannah as its largest city, voted heavily in favor of Democrats during the November election — a switch from its long history of supporting Republican candidates.\n\nOn Tuesday, residents were out in force in the county, where MarketWatch visited two polling locations.\n\nFifty-six-year-old Herbert Chaplin got to Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and said he wanted to make sure he cast his ballot before it was too late.\n\nThat one vote I cast is going to count, and I make sure since I was 18 years old that I always get my vote in, said the Democrat. Outside the church, a DJ was playing a mixture of hip-hop and R&B.\n\nVolunteers from the group WokeVote outside the Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah on Tuesday. Donnell Suggs\n\nBoth Biden and President Donald Trump visited the state to rally voters on Monday. Some Chatham County residents, however, needed no prodding.\n\nAlso read: Georgia voters head to polls in pivotal runoffs — but it may be a long wait until winners are known.\n\nThe only thing that would have stopped me from voting today was the Lord, said Johnny Simpson, a 60-year-old retiree, who voted at Jonesville Baptist Church.\n\nAt a polling station at a Salvation Army on Bee Road in Savannah, election official Sharon Chisholm was watching a steady stream of voters and observed that the whole nation has its eyes on Georgia.\n\nThough betting markets and polls gave the edge to Democrats on the eve of the runoffs, not all observers are convinced.\n\nVeda's base case expectation continues to be that Republicans will win the two Georgia Senate seats, wrote Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at Veda Partners, in a note on Tuesday.
SolarCity said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 550 jobs in Nevada as it continues a campaign against new, government-mandated solar metering rates.\n\nNevada's public commission said late last month that solar-panel users would get paid for their energy at lower, wholesale rates instead of at the higher, retail rates they had previously received. The commission also ordered public utility NV Energy to increase the monthly service charge for solar-panel users.
Meanwhile, Gardner said he is marshaling fellow lawmakers to oppose the new policy. A dozen senators met Tuesday in Gardner's office to talk about what we need to be doing legislatively and the direction we should be pursuing in Congress on this matter, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGardner declined to identify the senators, but he said they include Democrats and Republicans who represent states that have legalized marijuana for medical and recreational purposes and states that are considering doing so.\n\nAlthough marijuana is illegal under federal law, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing recreational consumption. Pot is legal, in some form or under some circumstances, in an additional 22 states.\n\nSessions's directive, issued last week, overturns an Obama-era policy discouraging federal enforcement in states where marijuana is legal. The attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. A survey conducted in October by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of U.S. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. Among Republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among GOP-leaning voters younger than 40.\n\nCannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. Politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.\n\nAmong Republicans, the topic is a particularly treacherous one, because it pulls at the seams of the party's coalition — pitting social conservatives against those who stand most strongly for states' rights, libertarians and fiscal hawks who see the burgeoning marijuana industry as a major source of tax revenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe attorney general is going to find out pretty quickly he's in a distinct minority, not only among the American public, but in the United States Congress, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management and author of the 2016 book Marijuana: A Short History.\n\nThis is one more headache, Hudak said, and one more issue that they do not want to be on the defensive about with the voters.\n\nMany of the places where marijuana legalization is most popular — in California, for instance, where it has just taken effect — are also areas where Republicans are struggling the hardest to hold onto House seats.\n\nAD\n\nSome insist that GOP candidates will not suffer from the new policy if they make clear that they disagree.\n\nRepublican candidates for Congress will answer that question based on what fits their district or state, said Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an evangelical political group that has campaigned against legalization.\n\nAD\n\nWill it really hurt us among young voters? It could, Reed acknowledged, but he added: You cannot ignore a federal law on the books. It breeds cynicism. It undermines respect. It undermines confidence in government itself.\n\nHow important marijuana becomes as a topic of campaign debate is likely to hinge on how Sessions's directive, issued last week, is implemented by U.S. attorneys across the country, many of whom are serving on an interim basis until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nWe now have, in what I believe is a states' rights area, 93 unelected federal officials determining state decisions, Gardner said.\n\nEarly indications are that they could head in significantly different directions, reflecting different priorities.\n\nIn Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim U.S. attorney Bob Troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.\n\nAD\n\nBut in Massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: Deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws Congress has already passed, and that I will not do.\n\nAD\n\nOregon has long had a tolerant attitude toward marijuana. It decriminalized possession of less than 1 ounce in 1973. And the newly legalized recreational pot industry brought in $85 million in tax revenue last year, said state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.\n\nWe have a growing, robust industry. You can't put that genie back in the bottle, Rosenblum said. We're not freaking out. One of the keys is a good relationship with your U.S. attorney.\n\nAD\n\nIn Oregon's case, the acting U.S. attorney, Billy J. Williams — who is awaiting Senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump sent mixed signals on the issue.\n\nHe told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. But as he was campaigning in Colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, Trump said in an interview with Denver's KUSA: I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.\n\nAD\n\nBut after Sessions announced the new policy, the White House declared that Trump was completely in agreement.\n\nThe President believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. That would be his top priority. That is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law.
They are unnecessary, unjustified, unmoored from a cost-benefit assessment, and unlikely to advance the Commission's stated goal of enhancing consumer privacy, wrote the Internet & Television Association, known as NCTA.\n\nThe petition joins a bevy of others from groups representing telecom companies, wireless carriers, tech companies and advertisers.\n\nAD\n\nThe rules, which passed by a 3-to-2 partisan vote favoring Democrats at the Federal Communications Commission in October, are meant to keep Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon and others from abusing the behavioral data they collect on customers as they regularly use the Internet.\n\nInformation such as your Web browsing history, your geolocation logs and even the content of your emails offer service providers a rich source of potential advertising revenue. That data, along with your health and financial information, can also be sold to marketers and data brokers interested in building a profile of you as a consumer. The FCC's rules restricted Internet providers' ability to use and share this information, in what privacy advocates hailed as a historic victory.\n\nAD\n\nBut now the fate of those regulations lies in question as Republicans prepare to take control of the nation's top telecom watchdog. Consumer advocacy groups vowed Wednesday to oppose the cable industry's petition.\n\nAD\n\nNothing in this election changed Americans' fundamental rights, or their need for privacy, said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press, an advocacy organization. The election only gave more power to the party that would seemingly rather side with Comcast and other cable lobbyists than with their own constituents.\n\nOpponents of the rules point out that the FCC's regulation created an imbalance in the law: While Internet providers must (for now) obey the restrictions, nothing forces Web companies such as Google and Facebook to do the same. For the past three years, the FCC under Democratic leadership has repeatedly vowed not to regulate Web companies, giving rise to complaints by telecom and cable lobbyists that the FCC was biased in their favor.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, defenders of the FCC's privacy rules argue that Internet providers are uniquely positioned to see everything a customer does with his or her connection — unlike services such as Facebook, whose understanding of user behavior is generally limited to the boundaries of its own platform.\n\nAD\n\nPolitically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. It was filed days after the departure of one Democratic commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior Democrat, Tom Wheeler, is due to step down. Both moves will leave the FCC with a two-Republican majority and a one-Democrat minority, allowing the GOP to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into the Oval Office.\n\nRepublicans at the FCC were already anticipating the opportunity last month.\n\nWe need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation, said Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai in a December speech to a conservative think tank.
Do you even need an unlimited plan?\n\nThis is the first question you'll want to answer before you grapple with the carriers' various offerings. Let's say you don't use your mobile data for very much beyond basic Web browsing and email. Or maybe the bulk of your smartphone usage happens while you're at home or at the office, where there's WiFi. Under those conditions, you might be better off signing up for a metered plan — that is, one with a monthly data cap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese plans tend to be more affordable than the typical unlimited data plan, assuming you stay within your data limits. For example, the difference in price between a 2 GB plan on Verizon and an unlimited plan on the same network is about $45 a month for a single line.\n\nExceeding your monthly cap on a metered plan could result in additional fees or reduced browsing speeds. If you find yourself blowing past your limit on a regular basis, you might consider upgrading to a larger data bucket or to an unlimited plan.\n\nTo figure out how much data you use in a month, follow these steps if you're an Android user and these instructions if you're on iOS. Spend a few weeks analyzing your habits, and some useful trends should emerge.\n\nAD\n\nUnlimited plans benefit heavy data users\n\nIf you stream lots of music or video over 3G or 4G LTE, then you may want to consider an unlimited plan. But which service to choose? Here's our side-by-side comparison of all the major carriers' offerings. We'll highlight particular points of interest below, but consider this a starting point.\n\nAs you can see, while it may be tempting simply to choose the cheapest option, there are a ton of other factors that may shape your decision.\n\nAD\n\nWhat's the catch?\n\nMany of these plans come with a trade-off of some kind or another, meaning that although they vastly expand the amount of data you're allowed to use compared with other plans, they're still not technically unlimited as their marketing may imply.\n\nAD\n\nAT&T, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, DirecTV or U-verse. It doesn't matter if you already have AT&T cellular service but not TV, or vice versa. You just need to end up with both phone and TV service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. This might not make sense if you already get your TV service through a company such as Comcast or Verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to TV. Note that DirecTV Now, AT&T's online streaming TV service, doesn't count toward this program. So if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (Update: AT&T has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of AT&T's TV services.)\n\nIf you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for T-Mobile or Sprint. Both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; Sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 Mbps and video to 480p resolution. This means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. There doesn't appear to be a way around Sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.\n\nAD\n\nT-Mobile's approach to content is a little more mixed. Customers of its unlimited plan, T-Mobile One, can choose whether to view online videos at reduced quality or at full HD resolution starting Feb. 17 for no extra charge (HD capabilities now cost an additional $15 per month per line).\n\nAD\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/831239592820871169\n\nThis offers greater flexibility, but for those who constantly stream at full HD, there are other risks to consider. Use too much data (more than 28 GB in a month) and T-Mobile may decide to slow down your connection.\n\nT-Mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 GB a month. This may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their Internet usage to a residential broadband plan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCan I share my phone's connection to a PC?\n\nIf you need to do some work on your laptop but there's no WiFi, one option is to share your phone's data connection with your PC. If this is important to you, you may want to choose Verizon or T-Mobile because they offer a lot of tethering data. Verizon's unlimited plan supports up to 10 GB of hotspot usage per month right out of the box, while T-Mobile plans to make 10 GB of monthly hotspot data available to T-Mobile One customers beginning Friday.\n\nWhat do I get if I travel a lot?\n\n\n\nIf you frequently travel to Canada or Mexico, T-Mobile arguably offers the easiest solution in its unlimited plan. Data roaming is included for those countries, and you don't have to go out of your way to add on a roaming package. You use your data just like you would in the United States. T-Mobile was also the first to liberalize its broader international roaming policies, which remain pretty competitive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat if I have a grandfathered unlimited plan?\n\nIf you signed up for an older unlimited plan years ago before companies such as AT&T and Verizon stopped selling unlimited plans, should you switch? The answer depends on what you're paying and whether some of the restrictions mentioned above are dealbreakers for you.\n\nAs an example, suppose you're paying $90 a month for a single grandfathered unlimited plan on Verizon, as this person does. (Note: This is an actual Verizon bill provided by a customer to The Washington Post. The customer provided it on the condition of anonymity to protect their personal financial information.)\n\nIt costs $39.99 a month for the phone line, plus $49.99 for the unlimited data. Because you can't have the unlimited data without the voice service, we can treat the sum as the effective cost of the unlimited plan. This person receives a few discounts here and there that appear tailored to their particular situation, so let's simply use the $90 base figure and move on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompared with the price of one of the new Verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. So switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. Because the customer used only about 7.9 GB of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to Verizon's 8 GB plan. But that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.
But the Taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands. Other factions, including breakaway Taliban groups and others claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, have footholds around the country and potentially could grow stronger without U.S.-led forces to keep them in check.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther major challenges lie ahead: Afghanistan's deepening political crisis, a controversial prisoner swap and complex intra-Afghan talks that could drag on for months or longer.\n\nEven the relative calm in Afghanistan over the past week — a precondition for the peace deal signing — was thrown into question.\n\nThe spokesman for the Taliban's Qatar office, Suhail Shaheen, told The Washington Post that the Taliban hoped for a permanent solution to violence levels. But the pledge for a week-long period of reduced violence has ended, he said.\n\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar inked the deal on an ornate desk in an opulent hall at a hotel in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony and witnessed the signing while seated across from the two men.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo called the moment historic and said the Taliban needed to live up to commitments to break with al-Qaeda and reduce violence.\n\nThe deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which U.S., Afghan and Taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. The agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue. Instead, it notes that a cease-fire would need to be agreed upon in intra-Afghan talks that are expected to start in 10 days.\n\nThe withdrawal will begin with a drawdown to 8,600 troops within 135 days, according to the document. During that time, U.S. allies and coalition members will also proportionally draw down their forces.\n\nAD\n\nTrump called the deal a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home in a statement released Friday.\n\nAD\n\nIn Kabul, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said there is real hope for peace in Afghanistan, but he warned the Taliban to meet its obligations under the deal.\n\nThe United States will not hesitate to nullify the agreement, Esper said at a ceremony with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that was held at the same time as the signing in Doha.\n\nStoltenberg called Saturday a victory for peace and noted increases in women's rights, life expectancy and respect for human rights.\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge now is to secure these gains, he said.\n\nGhani also pointed to advances made in Afghan society, including freedom of speech and the advancement of women's rights.\n\nToday can be the moment of overcoming the past, he said.\n\nBut criticism of the pact came from Trump's former White House team.\n\nAD\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton said the deal brings an unacceptable risk to America's civilian population.\n\nLegitimizing Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists, and to America's enemies generally, Bolton wrote in a tweet.\n\nUnder the deal, the Afghan government must assemble a negotiating team that will work with the Taliban to agree on the makeup of the country's new government. The peace deal stipulates that those talks must begin by March 10.\n\nGhani faces the challenge of building an inclusive negotiating team to represent the Afghans who are not aligned with the Taliban. The announcement of disputed election results earlier this month has left the government in Kabul deeply divided and has the potential to undermine Ghani's mandate to form that team.\n\nAnother potential obstacle is a planned prisoner exchange. The text of the peace deal released by the State Department said the prisoner swap — the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners in Afghan custody for about 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces in Taliban captivity — must occur by March 10 when inter-Afghan talks are set to start.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe peace deal also stated that the United States will work to remove members of the Taliban from sanctions lists and seek economic cooperation and reconstruction with the new post settlement Afghan Islamic government.\n\nFollowing the signing ceremony in Doha, Shaheen, the Taliban spokesman, told The Post that the Taliban is committed to the deal, but that doesn't mean violence levels will remain low in Afghanistan.\n\nThat was for making the environment conducive to sign the deal, Shaheen said. The Taliban hopes to achieve a permanent solution to violence levels in Afghanistan, but right now [there is] no such understanding of a cease-fire or reduction in violence.\n\nShaheen also suggested there may be some gray area in the Taliban's commitment not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil to plan and launch attacks against the United States and its allies.\n\nA peace deal with the Taliban has been a critical foreign policy goal for Trump, who campaigned on ending the war. But he has faced fierce criticism from the Afghan government as well as from fellow Republicans at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfghan officials have repeatedly criticized the United States for excluding them from talks with the Taliban. Any significant withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country is expected to place increased pressure on Afghan government forces, whose casualty rates continue to rise.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican lawmakers released a letter warning that the Taliban has a history of extracting concessions in exchange for false assurances.\n\nA full-scale U.S. withdrawal would allow terrorist groups in Afghanistan to grow stronger and establish safe havens from which to plot attacks against us, the letter continued.\n\nTrump's Friday statement said ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. and Taliban negotiators were close to signing a peace deal in September, but the effort was scuttled by Trump after an attack by the Taliban killed a U.S. soldier.\n\nSince then, Khalilzad has sought confidence-building measures to bring both sides back to the table. In November, the Taliban released two Western hostages in exchange for the release of senior militants linked to the Taliban by the Afghan government. And over the last week, both sides reduced violence nationwide.\n\nIt is unclear if the reduction in violence will hold in the coming weeks as Afghan government officials and the Taliban begin talks. The Afghan government initially demanded a cease-fire before agreeing to talks with the Taliban.\n\nAs peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban gained momentum last year, violence in Afghanistan intensified. The United Nations' annual report on civilian casualties released this month said 3,403 civilians were killed and 6,989 were injured in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has documented more than 100,000 civilian casualties since the organization began its tally in 2009.

Wonder Woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. But while it's a pretty bad DC Comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes DC Comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid Washington, D.C. movie. Given Hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see WW84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the District and its residents can be.\n\nThe bad first: WW84 is scattershot and nonsensical, seemingly designed solely around a desire to get pilot Steve Trevor, who died in the first film, back for a second go-round, even if that means negating his heroic sacrifice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, writers Patty Jenkins (who also directed) and Geoff Johns introduce Maxwell Lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. Where previous entries in the DC expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and Wonder Woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane You can't always get what you want or Be careful what you wish for.\n\nAll of this would be fine if the action sequences were any good; sadly, they are not. Perhaps it's just a function of watching this at home via HBO Max, as most people will, but everything on screen felt cheap and bland. There's nothing as exciting as the German assault on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira or her march through a World War I No Man's Land in the first film; everything is weightless and silly.\n\nStill, it's not all bad, and Wonder Woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. Unlike many Hollywood productions, the movie uses actual D.C. locations for both interior and exterior shots. Watching Wonder Woman stride through the iconic Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's entry and take a resurrected Steve on a tour of D.C.'s Metro system gave the picture a genuine Washington flair so often absent from movies like this. Big setpieces that take place on actual Washington streets in sight of the Capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the Watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the Reflecting Pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis fealty to D.C. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a Silver Line (or a Green Line!) in 1984, a pass. And it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get Toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for D.C.: WW84 joins Breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of D.C. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.\n\nMore than that, though, WW84 nails the mood of a certain sort of D.C. resident who believes that earning an internship in the White House would be enough to give a gangly young dork the gumption to ask a literal Amazon goddess out on a date.\n\nIndeed, in its treatment of folks around town — from the mousy-but-competent workers such as Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) who get lost in the bureaucracy that employs them to the full-of-themselves donors and interns who operate the shadow economy that keeps D.C.'s institutions running — WW84 has a lot in common with Shattered Glass, Billy Ray's movie about the fabulist Stephen Glass, who almost took down the New Republic. That movie captured the sociology of D.C., with its weird mélange of poor pay, idealism and naked ambition in the service of jockeying for social position, in a way that few others have managed. Like that movie, WW84 shows how Washington's institutions and mores leave it at risk of being corrupted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — Ronald Reagan, the architect of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, would have been unlikely to use Maxwell Lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. I will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of Israel Defense Forces vet Gadot taking apart the Egyptian King of Crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 won't top my Washington DC Area Film Critics Association nominations for best picture. But I'd be shocked if it didn't win the group's Joe Barber Award for Best Portrayal of Washington, D.C. More movies that purport to care about the capital and what happens here should take note.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD
Online purchasing is a potential lifeline for SNAP participants living in urban neighborhoods and rural communities where access to healthy food choices can be limited, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a news release last week.\n\nThe program will be tested in seven states, including Maryland. The USDA has partnered with several local and national retailers for the two-year pilot, including Hy-Vee and FreshDirect. In Maryland, SNAP recipients will be able to choose among Amazon, Safeway and ShopRite. Participants will be able to use SNAP to pay for eligible items, but delivery charges will come out of their own pockets. Bread, meat, fruits and vegetables are permitted; household items, beer and cigarettes are among the prohibited goods. (Disclosure: Amazon and The Washington Post share an owner.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program also stands to improve the lives of SNAP recipients who do not have cars and who may have to walk miles to a grocery store. And while come critics of the program might wonder about recipients' access to the Internet, Wonkblog's Rachel Premack reported in July that connectivity is less of a problem than transportation:\n\nAccess to at-home Internet is somewhat more common among the poor than access to a car — 88 percent vs. 79.6 percent . Take Mobile, Ala., where a third of residents are both below poverty level and live farther than half a mile from the nearest supermarket. Ninety-one percent of those below the poverty line have Internet access, and only 76 percent have a car. The option of home-delivered groceries, assuming the Internet access is fast enough to use the websites of grocery providers, could make life less stressful.\n\nPoor families might also choose to shop online for the same reason middle-class families do: They'll get extra time to spend at work or with their families, instead of shopping at a brick-and-mortar store. On the most basic level, time spent with children is a luxury low-income parents often cannot afford, Clio Chang wrote in a report for the Century Foundation. Emotional neglect can adversely affect childhood development.\n\nTo prevent fraud, SNAP purchases must have a higher level of security than other online purchases, the news release notes. The most recent statistics on stamp trafficking, one form of food stamp fraud, peg it at 1.3 percent nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSNAP grew significantly after the recession, but the number of caseloads has declined in recent years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than 44 million Americans benefit from the program; nearly half are children. Another push for access in 2013 expanded SNAP acceptance at farmers markets nationwide.
There is public interest value in the preservation of those stories, said Alex Howard, a government transparency advocate who previously served as deputy director of the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, has been one of the most prominent users of Instagram Stories. She's offered voters everything from videos of herself preparing Instant Pot macaroni and cheese to a behind-the-scenes look at her time on the Hill. Just yesterday she used it to respond to a CBS News 60 Minutes piece about her.\n\nAnd ephemeral messaging is only becoming more prevalent in the run-up to the 2020 campaign: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, cracked open a beer in her Instagram Story last week after announcing her presidential bid. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who's weighing a 2020 run, was a frequent Instagram Stories user during his 2018 campaign for senator, showing personal moments even after he lost of himself eating guacamole while driving.\n\nBut these Stories no longer exist on their Instagram accounts — and Howard says the public shouldn't have to simply rely on journalists or other observers to screenshot them for posterity. Ocasio-Cortez's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on her use of social media or whether they were archiving the ephemeral stories in any way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a stark contrast from federal agencies and the White House, which must comply with strict record-keeping rules, members of Congress have broad discretion over what they archive.\n\nHoward thinks it's time for new record-keeping rules, including ones account for social media and disappearing posts. Though much of the data created by congressional committees and administrative officers is considered official records and archived, individual members can decide what to do with papers and content created by their own offices. It's considered their personal property, and they can determine what they want to preserve. There's lots of reasons that politicians choose not to have things be archived, Howard says.\n\nCompare that to how the executive branch has handled social media. The Presidential Records Act, which went into effect in 1978, mandated that all official presidential records belong to the public. Presidents have kept this law in mind even when using new technologies. For instance, when the White House joined Snapchat in 2016, a senior Obama White House official told BuzzFeed that it would fully comply with those requirements, saving and preserving Snaps for archives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the short-term, Howard would like to see technology companies step up and create archives of photos and videos that verified politicians post to their accounts. He wants journalists and researchers to be able to access these posts, even if the politicians themselves are not preserving them. He said the archives could be similar to those that some technology companies have set up under intense political pressure to allow third parties to review political ads purchased on their platforms.\n\nThat would be the patch, Howard said. [The companies] created a bug in our democratic system of accountability.\n\nRight now politicians largely use this new form of social media to highlight light moments and seem more down-to-earth to voters, but some are worried about the impact this technology could have when it is used for more important policy announcements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Xiao Mina, the author of the upcoming book Memes to Movements, said in a tweet that the posts might seem innocuous because they are interesting selfie videos of cooking meals and attending orientation. But she warned disappearing posts could present problems as people try to document and understand the rise of political leaders:\n\nHoward said on Sunday that Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's use of Instagram Stories put a fine point on the fact that the trend has extended beyond U.S. politicians:\n\nThe controversy over Instagram Stories highlights the challenge for technology companies as the tools they created to connect friends are increasingly being used for political messaging — perhaps with consequences they never intended.\n\nAD\n\nIt is one of the idiosyncrasies of this moment that we are in where private companies are hosting public squares, Howard said.\n\nAD\n\nBITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES\n\nBITS: The big Apple news at this year's CES technology show will be the company's woes in China — a stark departure from the role the company's gadgets typically play in driving news at the annual Las Vegas trade show, Bloomberg News's Selina Wang and Mark Gurman report. It's going to be the elephant in the room at CES, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News. This has been dark days for Apple and for the tech industry. I think there's a lot of questions in regards to the smartphone industry going forward, especially with what Apple said about with demand in China.\n\nApple's warning that its sales would fall short last week has contributed to fears about an economic slowdown and the overall stability of the technology sector. Apple is set to encounter multiple hurdles in China this year amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing as well as increasing competition from local rivals, Reuters's Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis reported. Apple also faces a preliminary injunction by a Chinese court banning sales of several iPhone models, but the ban has not been enforced yet. Apple is not expected to roll out a 5G phone in China before next year, which would place it behind competitors including Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung, Reuters also reported.\n\nThe iPhone XR in particular struggles to convince Chinese consumers, as the Wall Street Journal's Yoko Kubota noted. The XR hasn't sold as expected in China because it is being passed over by both price-conscious buyers and status seekers, analysts say, Kubota wrote. Some Chinese consumers have perceived the sticker price of 6,499 yuan, or about $945, to be too expensive even though it is at least 25% cheaper than the higher-end iPhone XS and XS Max models.\n\nNIBBLES: Democratic operatives and a research firm who played a role in an online effort to influence a 2017 U.S. Senate race in Alabama to help elect Democrat Doug Jones are distancing themselves from the initiative's most controversial tactics that were inspired by Russian disinformation, according to The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe operation, called Project Birmingham, used tactics such as a false flag effort to create bogus evidence that Russian bots supported Jones's Republican opponent Roy Moore on Twitter, according to a 12-page document obtained by The Post. Another component of Project Birmingham was the creation of a deceitful Facebook page targeting conservative voters in Alabama and aiming to hamper Moore's campaign.\n\nIn a second online effort against Moore, progressive Democratic operatives posed as conservatives on Facebook and Twitter and claimed to be part of a Dry Alabama movement that supported the Republican candidate, according to the New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder. The Times reported that the Democratic operatives thought associating Mr. Moore with calls for a statewide alcohol ban would hurt him with moderate, business-oriented Republicans and help Jones.\n\nBYTES: Ford is set to start testing self-driving vehicles in the nation's capital early this year, and officials in Washington and other cities are working to anticipate how technological changes in transportation will affect their communities, according to The Post's Michael Laris. D.C. and other cities partnered with the Aspen Institute and Bloomberg Philanthropies to set common goals for developers of driverless cars. High on the list of priorities is cutting greenhouse gases and other pollution, eliminating congestion and ensuring that officials have the opportunity to adapt as changes barrel ahead, Michael wrote. The initiative also includes Los Angeles, Austin, London, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and other cities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen we think about the future of our city, we see less single-occupancy vehicle trips, more vehicle electrification and an emphasis on building the infrastructure and policy framework to support those goals, Jeff Marootian, director of the District Department of Transportation, told my colleague. For instance, the city added electric buses to its Circulator fleet and has started a push to convert more than 75,000 streetlights into LEDs that save energy, according to Marootian.\n\nPRIVATE CLOUD\n\n-- The Internet and Television Association (known as NCTA), Cable Labs and Cable Europe talked exclusively with me about their plans for 10G broadband networks, an initiative they plan to unveil at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.\n\nSuch a network would be about ten times as fast as the current speeds available to most consumers today, NCTA President Michael Powell tells me. Lab trials of the technology are already underway, and they expect field trials to begin in 2020. He says broadband at these speeds could enable a host of new technologies, by enabling better video streaming or making it easier to use connected home devices. Both trends are expected to be in the spotlight this week at the annual trade show.\n\nIt's more than just watching 'House of Cards,' Powell said. He's hoping faster broadband speeds will enable innovations in fields like healthcare, where the technology could enable new ways to process medical images and videos. Powell's comments come as 5G , the fifth generation of cell networks technology, is setting the agenda at CES. Powell tells me every evolution in the mobile networks needs to be met with new technology in broadband networks. The country critically needs both, Powell said.\n\n— In a report exploring JPMorgan Chase's relationship with Amazon, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer, Laura Stevens and AnnaMaria Andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos established at the online retail giant. Mr. Bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep Amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and FAQs, according to the Journal. Over roughly the past 18 months, JPMorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under Gordon Smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [JPMorgan] employees said. JPMorgan has also embraced Bezos's Customer Obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the Journal. (Bezos owns The Post.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n— Netflix is the latest example of software companies that seek to sell their services directly to consumers and circumvent Apple or Google, my colleague Brian Fung reported. Netflix confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through iTunes.

The 25 percent tariffs enacted in August are hurting the company's profitability, according to Tesla. Increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability, Tesla said in a request to the government for tariff exemption, as Shepardson reported. The company also said in the request that it has not been able to find another supplier with the required specifications, at the volume requested and under the timelines necessary for Tesla's continued growth.\n\n— More technology news from the public sector:\n\nFAST FWD\n\n— Four of the nine scheduled keynote speakers at CES this year are women, a sign that the event's organizers are starting to promote gender equity at the technology show, the Associated Press's Barbara Ortutay reported. The activist group GenderAvenger recently gave CES a Gold Stamp of Approval for the show's lineup. The group said the keynote and featured speakers include 45 percent of women, 60 percent of whom are women of color.\n\nBut really leveling the playing field often means more than inviting female CEOs to speak, Ortutay wrote. For starters, women and people of color are underrepresented in the tech industry, especially in leadership and technical roles. So, conference organizers might need to look harder, or be more flexible in who they invite to speak.\n\n#TRENDING\n\n404 ERROR\n\n— Huawei punished two employees for wishing people a happy new year via the company's Twitter account with an iPhone, according to Reuters's Sijia Jiang.

DICKERSON: When I talked to Republicans on the Hill, they wonder, what in the White House -- what have you all learned from this experience with the executive order?\n\nMILLER: Well, I think that it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, John, the idea that you have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before.\n\nThe end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
Stocks surged after Powell's remarks, with the Dow Jones industrial average leaping more than 600 points in late-morning trading. The Fed has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but Wall Street traders and Trump don't want any. Powell's comments indicate the Fed might be revising its views.\n\nAD\n\nWith the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said during a panel discussion at the American Economic Association annual meeting alongside former Fed chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke. We're always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Powell of raising interest rates so fast that it's hurting the economy, but the Fed argues that the economy is expanding faster than normal and no longer needs low rates to stimulate growth.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the central bank raised interest rates in December, Trump asked advisers if it's possible to fire Powell, an unprecedented move that many think isn't legally possible since a Fed governor can only be removed for cause.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked Friday if he would step down if Trump asked, Powell said simply, no.\n\nThe president picked Powell for the Fed's top job in late 2017 but has quickly soured on him after the Fed raised interest rates a full percentage point last year, an action that can slow the economy. Several of Trump's top aides have said publicly that the president can't fire Powell because Fed appointees can only be removed for cause, which courts have interpreted as criminal activity.\n\nThe Fed chair said that he hasn't spoken with Trump, although Powell indicated he would be willing to meet with the president. I can't think of any Fed chairs who didn't eventually meet with the president, Powell said while seated alongside Yellen and Bernanke.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLarry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, said he thinks a meeting between Trump and Powell will happen and that it will help both sides to talk through their differences. But Kudlow and Powell said no meeting has been scheduled yet.\n\nIt would be nice to have a frank and a candid exchange up close and personal, Kudlow said Friday morning in an interview on Bloomberg TV. President Trump would benefit. I think Jay Powell would benefit.\n\nPowell vowed repeatedly Friday that the central bank would be flexible as it decides whether to continue raising interest rates in 2019. Yellen supported the strategy, saying the Fed is in a good position to maintain that flexibility.\n\nAD\n\nAll three said the U.S. economy would grow at a slower rate this year than last but that they saw little sign of a recession.\n\nAD\n\nIt's likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018, Bernanke said. This is not something that is news. We've anticipated this for a long time because it was clear the stimulus would be dying down over time.\n\nYellen added that growth is still likely to end up being above the growth rate of potential, which is consistent with a strong labor market and maybe even some further tightening.\n\nThe Fed recently cut its forecast for growth in 2019 to 2.3 percent (down from 2.5 percent) as concerns grow about the stock market correction and the slowdown in China and Europe dragging down the U.S. economy. But Fed leaders still insist that is above trend and very healthy growth.\n\nAD\n\nUnemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now. We have inflation under control. I think that's a pretty good outcome, and we sure think it can continue, Powell said, adding that he feels fine about capital markets.\n\nAD\n\nPowell's optimism was bolstered Friday when the Labor Department announced the economy added 312,000 jobs in December, blowing out expectations and capping the best year of job growth since 2015.\n\nIf the U.S. economy keeps growing through July, this will be the longest expansion in U.S. history. Bernanke predicted the economy would achieve this milestone and that people shouldn't fear an immediate downturn just because the nation has never experienced economic growth for this long.\n\nExpansions don't die of old age. I like to say they get murdered, Bernanke said.
Soon after he made his announcement at 2 p.m. during a Senate floor speech, the criticism came rolling in fast and furious as he drew denunciations from senior campaign officials, the president's family members, fellow GOP senators and his own niece.\n\nMitt should be expelled from the @SenateGOP conference. #expelMitt, Donald Trump Jr., wrote on Twitter before logging onto Instagram to mock Romney for wearing mom jeans.\n\nAD\n\nOnly the President's political opponents — all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate — voted for the manufactured impeachment articles, said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who worked for Romney's presidential campaign in 2012.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Romney's niece, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, offered him no quarter.\n\nThis is not the first time I've disagreed with Mitt, and I imagine it will not be the last, she said in statement. The bottom line is President Trump did nothing wrong, and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him. I, along with the GOP, stand with President Trump.\n\nWhether the thirst for vengeance against Romney is sustained will hinge on Trump, who has long smarted from the Utah Republican's criticism of him and takes pride in hitting back at perceived and real enemies.\n\nAD\n\nParty and campaign officials said privately that they hoped Trump wouldn't obsess over the lone defection and move on from impeachment, basking in his acquittal instead of engaging in a days-long tiff with Romney. The president has firm control of the party and could dictate a strategy that is more aggressive, advisers said, if his pique at Romney flares.\n\nAD\n\nTrump told advisers in recent weeks that he was more worried about Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) than Romney, according to people who heard his comments. In the end, Collins and Murkowski voted with the president.\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak about the Senate vote to acquit him of the two House impeachment charges at the White House on Thursday — an event that will serve as an indication whether he's ready to move on from Romney's vote or try to make him another of example of what happens to Republicans who cross him.\n\nAD\n\nRomney said he couldn't let concerns over breaking with his party guide his vote, which he cast as one of conscience and rooted in his religious beliefs.\n\nI am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced, Romney said on the Senate floor. I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nAD\n\nThe senator said he had not slept past 4 a.m. since the Senate impeachment trial began last month, wrestling over how he should vote, and eventually decided to buck the president because he saw the evidence that Trump pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals as overwhelming.\n\nAD\n\nRomney told The Washington Post that he asked the White House for more information about actions taken toward Ukraine, particularly concerning acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but none was provided. He wanted former national security adviser John Bolton to testify, which he said could have potentially raised reasonable doubt that the president did anything wrong and lead him to vote to acquit. The Senate rejected subpoenaing Bolton.\n\nRepublican and campaign officials said among the steps that could be taken to punish Romney are continued attacks on Twitter or through paid advertisements. Trump allies could also help fund an opponent in his state, although he's not up for reelection until 2024, or push operatives or donors not to support or work for him. White House officials could block policy or budget priorities that Romney wants, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\nAD\n\nA senior Trump campaign official said the longer the Romney news cycle drags on, the worse it is for the president, because it focuses attention on his impeachment. Advisers were encouraging Trump to not dignify Romney's vote with a response, and there were no immediate plans to campaign against Romney.\n\nAD\n\nIrrelevant relic, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nLittle punch. Move on. It's over, one senior campaign official said, to describe the strategy. We were already done with him.\n\nRomney's colleagues are highly unlikely to kick him out of the Senate Republican conference, but the president's allies could push for such a move and make life uncomfortable for Romney and his colleagues. While several senators criticized Romney's vote, many were quick to oppose giving him the boot.\n\nAD\n\nI'm glad Mitt is a Republican, said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he was surprised and disappointed with Romney's vote but said the Utah Republican was largely supportive of the president.\n\nAD\n\nWe don't have any doghouses here. The most important vote is the next vote, he said.\n\nMcDaniel issued the statement quickly to make clear whose side she was on and to get ahead of potential stories that were likely to question her loyalty to the president if she remained silent, a Republican official said. She did not receive a heads-up from her uncle and the president did not ask her to put out a statement, according to the official.\n\nThe White House did not receive an advance notice of Romney's decision, though some aides were preparing for the idea that he would go against the president.\n\nAD\n\nNeither Trump nor White House staff lobbied Romney, according to aides. It wouldn't have helped, said one senior White House aide directly involved in the impeachment process.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Trump takes particular pride in Republicans sticking with him, regularly peppering aides with questions about any Republican defections on legislation. During impeachment, he repeatedly told advisers that he wanted a bipartisan acquittal — hoping to get at least one Democrat to vote with him, and for Republicans to stick together.\n\nNo Democrats voted to acquit the president, leaving Romney as the only senator to break with his party.\n\nThe president spent much of a weekend in early October attacking Romney on Twitter, but advisers said that was largely designed to telegraph to other Republicans that they should not buck the president.\n\nAD\n\nParty officials said they did not give instructions for anyone to call for Romney's expulsion from the party, but one Republican fundraiser said that donors who once supported Romney are now solidly behind Trump. As the Republican Party noted in its release attacking Romney, the president is more popular than the senator in Utah.\n\nAD\n\nI suspect that donors and operatives are not going to be allowed to play both sides of the field. They are going to have to choose, said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr. He is going to be considered a pariah moving forward.\n\nTrump has complained that he endorsed Romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for Senate and that Romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the Senate in early 2019. Trump met with Romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAides note Romney was at the White House twice in November, including for a lengthy meeting on vaping in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nDuring a November Oval Office meeting with political advisers, some suggested attacking Romney but Trump told them to hold off, hoping he would stick with Republicans on impeachment.\n\nPeople close to Romney say he knows where he currently stands in the Republican Party — on an island — but will not be cowed by Trump's attacks. While he agrees with Trump regularly on policy, his advisers said he sees standing up against some of Trump's behavior as a moral imperative.\n\nHe's not someone who operates from a center of fear. I don't think it had anything to do with his decision, said Stuart Stevens, a former adviser to Romney and a critic of Trump. He tried to look at this as if, what would he do if a Democrat was in office? He wanted to be a true juror. He took it very seriously. I think Mitt Romney will sleep very well tonight.\n\nBrendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said Romney would get attacked repeatedly just as Ryan did when he occasionally criticized the president.
The Afghan war in particular could become a key campaign issue in the upcoming presidential cycle after a decade on the sidelines, and liberal Democrats in the House may have more leeway to raise objections to U.S. military involvement under Democratic leadership.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Warren took issue with the president's style but not his position that the United States should bow out of what she called endless wars.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign Feb. 9, more than a month after announcing her exploratory committee. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nI think it is right to get our troops out of Syria — and, let me add, I think it's right to get our troops out of Afghanistan, Warren said.\n\nThe position is further than other potential 2020 candidates have gone so far, but could open the door for other Democrats calling for a reconsideration of the U.S. mandate in Afghanistan.\n\nPotential 2020 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Afghanistan an unwinnable war in 2008 and as a presidential candidate in 2016 said he opposed continuation of the Afghan occupation.\n\nAD\n\nJoe Biden, who has the most foreign policy experience among frequently mentioned potential 2020 Democrats, opposed the large-scale troop surge when he served as Barack Obama's vice president. He favored a smaller counterterrorism force.\n\nWarren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told interviewer Rachel Maddow that after 17 years of war there remain lots of different problems in Afghanistan, and what seems to be the answer from the foreign policy establishment? 'Stay forever.' That is not a policy. We can't do that.\n\nAD\n\nWarren, like other Democrats and some Republicans, took issue with Trump's abrupt announcement via Twitter last month that he would immediately close out the troop commitment in Syria. Roughly 2,000 U.S. forces are there under a limited mandate authorized by Obama in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement, in which Trump declared that the Islamic State had been defeated, prompted the resignation of retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis as defense secretary and the resignation of the lead U.S. envoy to the coalition fighting the militant group.\n\nYou can talk about our generals. I gave our generals all the money they wanted. They didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan, Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that was open to reporters. They've been fighting in Afghanistan for 19 years.\n\nObama had approved an enormous expansion of the Afghan war during his first term in office — a surge bringing military gains that have now been substantially reversed. Obama also was unable to end the Iraq War as he had hoped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who visited troops in Iraq last month in his first trip to a war zone, has said he supports the continuation of that mission. But he has ordered the gradual departure of about half the approximately 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe merits of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria were a back-burner issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine's long-running effort to force a reconsideration of the George W. Bush-era war authorization.\n\nKaine annoyed some in the Obama White House by pushing for Senate review of the 2001 military authorization, and he argues that congressional oversight is even more essential now. Like other Democrats, however, he takes issue with Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.\n\nAD\n\nI don't trust President Trump's ability to keep us safe by himself, and I'm very concerned that he's making decisions that go against military advice, without consulting Congress or our allies, Kaine said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nIn the House, antiwar Democrat Rep. Barbara Lee of California will continue her efforts to repeal the 2001 military authorization she said has now been used or misused in more than two dozen instances far afield from the original invasion of Afghanistan that it covered. She was the lone member of Congress to vote against the authorization, days after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAD\n\nI've always considered this a top-priority issue, Lee said in an interview. It's a blank check to use force anywhere in the world.\n\nAD\n\nLee would not on speculate whether a majority of her colleagues would support a renewal of that authorization now. But congressional leaders of both parties have long avoided the question in large part out of concern that a no vote would undermine the president and existing military missions.\n\nThe public deserve to understand the costs and consequences of war, Lee said. Congress has been missing in action.\n\nLee may get new support from liberal antiwar Democrats who took their seats on Thursday, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. During her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez said she probably would not have voted in favor of any of the troop commitments approved since the start of the Afghan war, although she voiced some support for Obama's rationale that his troop increase was an attempt to deal with this mess of going into Afghanistan in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Afghan war has not been a major focus for new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and it is not clear whether she has much appetite for a major debate on the U.S. commitment there.\n\nPelosi led a congressional delegation to Afghanistan in March last year. Our meetings confirmed that Afghanistan has come a long way with the support of the U.S. and other international partners but formidable challenges remain, she said at the time.\n\nDan Feldman, who served as Obama's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, supports the current Trump administration efforts to foster peace talks with the Taliban and said Trump undercut that effort by demanding an arbitrary drawdown.\n\nAD\n\nBut Feldman is not surprised that some Democrats align with Trump's larger point on ending conflicts.
Nick Mullins is a founder of Breaking Clean, an environmental communications firm. He blogs at thethoughtfulcoalminer.com.\n\nBefore going to work as an underground coal miner, I worked for a subcontractor installing large mine-ventilation fans throughout the Appalachian coal fields. My co-workers were a rough sort. Some had worked as underground miners, while others had known only industrial construction or demolition. Several of them abused pain medications.\n\nI was not a user, so they would ask me if I'd turn them in. My typical response: Do what you want to do, but if I catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, I'll make sure you never work here again.\n\n(Monica Akhtar,Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nMy attitude did not change after I began working in a mine closer to home just outside Clintwood, Va. The company I worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. But the problem was still apparent. We would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.\n\nSome may judge me for not turning people in. But before I rushed to judgment, I considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.\n\nCoal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.\n\nMany of those I worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. They had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. Those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. In many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.\n\nMine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. Few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. Even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.\n\nIn Clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. It is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. The only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. Again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.\n\nIf a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. It is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.\n\nWith recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into Appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. Not only has Wall Street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.\n\nOver the past three decades, I have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. If we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal.
Playing on his nickname, the Observer newspaper in England once dubbed him The Sundance Kid of the Caribbean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was a considered a White Jamaican with European roots, but he was born and bred on the island and retained his Caribbean accent. As well as his resorts, he founded the daily Jamaica Observer to compete with the island's oldest newspaper, the Gleaner (launched in 1834).\n\nLeading a group of investors, he also bought the national airline Air Jamaica in 1994, expanding its routes beyond the Caribbean to destinations including the United States and the United Kingdom. The airline continued to lose money, however, and after Mr. Stewart and his group pulled out in 2004, it bounced between state and private control until it went out of business in 2015.\n\nHe twice put his money where his mouth was for Jamaica when its foreign currency holdings were low and democratic socialism was on the rise: First in the 1970s and '80s when he realized the island had to build tourism hotels. Then, in 1992, when the economy was threatened by currency speculators, he pumped $30 million of his own money into Jamaican banks to keep them afloat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Stewart, 79, died Jan. 4 in Miami, according to his son Adam Stewart, who now takes over the Sandals Resorts International empire and who did not give a specific cause of death. He did say that his father had received a recent medical diagnosis but had kept it quiet so as not to worry his friends or workers. In May last year he had donated $31.5 million to Jamaican authorities to help families suffering from the coronavirus.\n\nGordon Arthur Cyril Stewart was born in the Jamaican capital Kingston on July 6, 1941. His father had been brought to Jamaica from England as a baby and became a radio maintenance technician at the state-run Jamaica Broadcasting Corp., while his mother ran an appliance dealership.\n\nHe first went to school at Campion Hall Jesuit preparatory school in Kingston, where a priest once dubbed him the most unlikely to succeed in life, and later in the parish of St. Ann on Jamaica's north coast. He was sent to England to complete his education at a school in London.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy 10, he was obsessed by the sea and soon began to find any ways to make money. From a tree trunk, he built himself a dugout canoe; later he bought a bigger boat, caught fish and sold it to local hotels. He also learned he could make decent bucks by taking wealthy visitors from their yachts to shore and back.\n\nAccording to his friend, Jamaica Observer founding editor Desmond Allen, he once took glamorous British actress Joan Collins to a secluded reef where she proceeded to have a nude dip. He was still a boy, and she did not invite him to join her. (He could only have dreamed then that he would one day own his own 132-foot, $5 million yacht, the Lady Sandals, on which he sailed until shortly before his death.)\n\nHe was in his early 20s when he saw a moneymaking opportunity while the first James Bond film Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, was being shot in Jamaica. He borrowed his father's motorboat to take Connery and the film crew to location sites, including a shipwreck. He was also of a mechanical bent and bought dilapidated cars, spruced them up and sold them for a healthy profit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter his spell at school in London, he returned to Jamaica and soon became a successful sales manager for the Dutch-owned Curacao Trading Co. In 1968, he set up his own company, Appliance Traders Ltd., to sell air-conditioning units, fridges and freezers, and it remains the parent company to Sandal Resorts International.\n\nHis son Jonathan died in a car accident in 1989, and Mr. Stewart said he plunged into a months-long depression. Survivors include his third wife, Cheryl, and seven children from his three marriages; his mother; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. Stewart ran into serious controversy in the 1990s when, with the gay rights movement blossoming, he was attacked for his no-gay policy at Sandals resorts. The initial policy, from 1981, was that Sandals resorts, starting with the first one at Montego Bay, would be for couples (heterosexuals) only. At the time, homosexuality was still illegal in Jamaica.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Stewart eventually caught up with the times and abolished the policy in 2004, and the Sandals resorts have continued to prosper. He created the Beaches resorts for families, also a major success.\n\nThe anti-gay policy damaged him abroad but not in Jamaica, where he often strolled (without bodyguard) around Kingston to shouts of Mornin', Butch! In his office one morning in 1996, while he lounged in a beige armchair wearing his trademark Harrods of London striped shirt — no tie — and with one foot on a glass coffee table, he was asked by a journalist for the London Independent: What are you worth?\n\nI don't have any money. I sank it all into this, he replied, indicating a model of an Air Jamaica jetliner. We come out of a culture that says everything that happens has to be done by the government. More and more people are realizing you've got to do it on your own.
Beginning in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order denying work to those suspected of sexual perversion, thousands of gay men and women were forced out of the federal bureaucracy. While the exact number of victims claimed by this lavender scare is difficult to quantify, one scholar estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people were affected, far exceeding those expelled in the simultaneous (not to mention much more extensively documented and remembered) red scare.\n\nMany gay and lesbian workers quietly resigned rather than face humiliating security interrogations, others committed suicide without leaving an explanation, and untold numbers never even applied for jobs due to the prohibition on their employment. It was not until 1995, when President Bill Clinton signed an executive order reversing the Eisenhower measure, that sexual orientation was removed from the list of conditions justifying the denial of a security clearance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the Cold War was twofold. The first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. Because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. So shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.\n\nThe genesis for this belief lay in the career of Col. Alfred Redl. A gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the Austro-Hungarian army, Redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to Russia in 1913. Redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his Russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late Belle Époque Vienna. However, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that Redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the Russians over it.\n\nThe revelation of Redl's treason just before the outbreak of World War I inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. Over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. Five decades after Redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the Austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of Washington politics Advise and Consent, later made into a hit film directed by Otto Preminger. The book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. Although Advise and Consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.\n\nFears about gay Americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the Cold War. Previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. In 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. Nonetheless, Hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. Hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of Congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.\n\nHillenkoetter alluded to a case that year involving a Soviet intelligence operation wherein our task will be made considerably easier by the appearance in the area of a known homosexual who we think will be extremely helpful in this particular case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the Cold War inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. The specter of a Homosexual International, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful Communist one. A series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.\n\nIn 1948, Time magazine journalist Whittaker Chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, was a member of his cell. While Chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, Hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.\n\nLikewise, when British diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean defected to the Soviet Union in 1951, and two National Security Agency cryptologists, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, fled to Moscow in 1960, many attributed their defections to deviant sexualities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Burgess was openly gay and Mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. Nonetheless, pressure from the FBI over the Burgess affair led the British government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the Foreign Service, and media portrayed Martin and Mitchell as lovers.\n\nThe sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay Americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. Never in American history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. The more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist Joe Alsop in 1957. When the KGB entrapped him having sex with another man in a Moscow hotel room, Alsop marched straight to the American Embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. Years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across Washington, Alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the Soviet regime.\n\nMoreover, it never seemed to cross the minds of intelligence professionals like Roscoe Hillenkoetter or the senators questioning him that a gay person was by necessity someone skilled at keeping secrets in a homophobic society and therefore might actually be predisposed for espionage work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 1969 Stonewall uprising against police harassment at a Greenwich Village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. But a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in Washington, D.C., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights.
Republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as House speaker, despite dissent.\n\nWhy do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? Parties make a critical trade-off. They empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. But those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.\n\nThis is what my research shows\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. I support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.\n\nParties face a dilemma when writing rules. If the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the Rules Committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. But if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.\n\nSince the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. A variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow does Pelosi maintain power?\n\nHouse chamber and Democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the House. Since the November elections, Pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. That included creating a leadership position for Rep. Barbara Lee; reviving the House administration subcommittee on elections for Rep. Marcia L. Fudge to chair; and promising the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group within the House that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.\n\nPelosi's entrenchment echoes that of Boehner (2011-2015): The Ohio Republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every GOP House member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be sure, Boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. He ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. Still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly Boehner neutralized potential rivals.\n\nPast partisans often preferred weaker leaders\n\nParties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. Throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. As a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.\n\nAD\n\nOnly the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers Nicholas Longworth (R), 1925-1931, and Sam Rayburn (D), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. Party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. With leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as Charles Halleck (R), 1959-1965; Frederick Gillett (R) 1919-1925; and John McCormack (D) 1962-1971.\n\nAD\n\nThis system had serious shortcomings. When party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the House struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. For example, McCormack failed to pass most of the Kennedy legislative program in the 87th Congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large Democratic majority.\n\nAs parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. But a leader who engendered dissent within the party like Pelosi likely would not have survived.\n\nAD\n\nPelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power\n\nIf Democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until Pelosi leaves office. Since Pelosi was elected House minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.\n\nAD\n\nConsider the rule changes to which Pelosi reportedly agreed. The changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. Pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.\n\nBut that is not a significant change. The rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. The new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. The other promised changes have such large loopholes that Pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the House floor.\n\nLikewise, Pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. In 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as House speaker. She will have served as the top Democrat in the House for 19 years. If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, Pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. And if the Republican experience provides any guidance, Democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.
A bipartisan meeting on immigration policy at the White House on Tuesday is designed to bring the sides together. If Trump and lawmakers can strike an immigration deal, negotiators on both sides think that other issues, including how to fund a children's health insurance program and a roughly $80 billion package to pay for disaster relief, could be resolved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese former congressional interns share why the battle in Congress over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is so personal. (Melissa Macaya, Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nAhead of the meeting, the Trump administration released to lawmakers a request to pay $18 billion over 10 years for a mix of walls, fencing and other security technology. GOP lawmakers have said they were waiting for the plan to know the parameters of talks with Democrats.\n\nInstead of the saber-rattling, let's get in a room and figure out reasonable, sound policy for securing the border, helping [dreamers] . . . and solving this problem for the first time in two decades, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a lead GOP immigration negotiator, told Fox News Channel on Sunday.\n\nBut Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who voted against the temporary spending plan in December, characterized the looming shutdown as an opportunity for Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAD\n\nI believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, Democrats will regain the House and Senate. But you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, Sanders said in an interview. If it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'It doesn't make a difference. Why should I be involved?' \n\nHere's a look at the dreamers whose DACA protections are set to expire. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans control Congress but Democrats hold significant leverage over spending talks. In the House, hard-liners on the right have regularly voted against recent spending bills, requiring GOP leaders to rely on at least some Democratic votes to pass. In the Senate, spending bills require at least 60 votes to avoid procedural hurdles, and Republicans only hold 51 seats.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a lead Democratic negotiator on immigration, called Trump's detailed request outrageous and said he would continue working instead with Republicans who understand what is at stake in hopes of striking a bipartisan deal.\n\nAD\n\nProgressives such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose Harlem-area district is home to more than 2,000 constituents protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, said he will continue voting against GOP spending plans that don't include protections. Over the holiday recess, he said DACA was the issue I heard about the most when I'm walking in my district.\n\nEvery time it's delayed, the movement just gets stronger, the outcry gets louder, he added.\n\nProgressive groups are planning to apply fresh pressure on Democrats who voted to temporarily extend government funding in December without addressing DACA — a mix of moderates facing reelection this year in states Trump won in 2016 and others from states with sizable populations of federal government workers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe are laser-focused on January 19 as a do-or-die moment, said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group organizing protests on Capitol Hill against Republicans and Democrats who have voted for previous GOP spending bills.\n\nAlthough the situation facing dreamers is a crisis that was created by Donald Trump, Martinez said Democrats are not without power, especially now that Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) has joined the caucus. They have a closer margin now, and we expect them to meet their public and private commitment to us that they'll use every leverage they have.\n\nIndivisible, the progressive grass-roots network of citizen groups, said it will focus its efforts on six Democratic senators from left-leaning states — Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall of New Mexico and Tim Kaine and Mark R. Warner of Virginia. Kaine, Stabenow and Heinrich face reelection this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have done a poor job of playing hardball, said Angel Padilla, the group's policy director. They said for three months they would use their leverage in December to get this done, and that didn't happen. In order to have leverage, the other side has to believe you'll use that leverage, and I don't think that [Republicans] think that [Democrats] will use that leverage.\n\nSpokesmen for the senators said the lawmakers support dreamers but had various reasons for backing the last spending bill.\n\nUdall said a government shutdown would be a disaster for New Mexico and the 45,000 residents who work for the federal agencies and research labs in his state.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, said he will keep pushing for a solution for dreamers and he'll evaluate a deal once he's seen it.\n\nAD\n\nDespite Trump's renewed calls for a border wall, Republicans remain frayed over how to move forward. Some moderates are willing to either pass a bill giving dreamers a path to citizenship or craft a deal with Democrats that would include some border security measures. But the bulk of the conservative rank-and-file want more in exchange for accepting an immigration policy that much of the Republican base opposes.\n\nAs the fulcrum of the immigration talks has shifted decisively toward the Senate, lawmakers on the hard right are pressuring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to be more assertive. They are wary that House members will get jammed with a Senate bill that they will have no choice but to pass mainly with Democratic votes.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said it was essential that House Republicans pass a stand-alone immigration bill that promotes conservative priorities in line with Trump's agenda.\n\nAD\n\nIf the only thing you do is wait for something the Senate can pass, then what we might as well do is have the House recess for the next nine months, he said. Allowing Democrats to dictate immigration policy at a time of Republican control of Congress and the White House is distasteful and certainly not in keeping with what we promised the American people.\n\nAmid a slate of partisan and bipartisan proposals, another conservative immigration plan may emerge in the coming days. According to a lawmaker and a GOP aide familiar with the plans, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is expected to unveil a bill as soon as this week that would address DACA in exchange for a raft of conservative priorities on immigration.\n\nAD\n\nGoodlatte's plan would grant legal status to DACA recipients, provide funding for a border wall, end a visa lottery program criticized by Trump, take action against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and roll back rules allowing legal immigrants to sponsor the entry of certain family members. But House Republican leaders do not think the bill will be able to garner enough support to pass by the deadline.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for Goodlatte declined to comment.\n\nBipartisan immigration talks in the House have produced little visible progress. A bipartisan group of moderates, the Problem Solvers Caucus, created an immigration task force that formed the outlines of a deal, said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), one of the participants, but the larger caucus wouldn't sign on.\n\nWe're not there right now, and we're going to start working on it again when we come back, Coffman said.\n\nAshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said he was continuing to speak with lawmakers in both chambers but isn't committed to permitting a vote on a bill granting dreamers a path to citizenship.\n\nBeyond DACA, Republicans and Democrats say they're making progress over how much money should go to the military vs. domestic programs, something that has to be settled to raise automatic spending caps.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House wants to set discretionary defense spending levels at about $603 billion, which would exceed current automatic spending caps by $54 billion. Republicans think non-defense levels should see less of an increase, closer to $35 billion. But Democrats are insisting on parity, arguing in recent weeks that non-defense spending bolsters programs to fight opioid addiction and terrorism and protect the southern border.\n\nSanders said he would urge Congress to reject any deal that increases military spending by more than what is spent on domestic programs. If we're going to spend a dollar more in the military, we must spend a dollar more on the enormously important issues facing working families. All of these issues are in crisis mode, and they have to be dealt with right now.
If you're doing any Cargill-related business – if for example you have a conference call and you think you should take it from home on your commute into work in the morning — that's absolutely not acceptable, company spokeswoman April Nelson said. She said GPS devices necessary for navigation may be used so long as they are programmed before travel and mounted for hands-free use.\n\nAD\n\nThe Minnesota-based company, whose new policy applies to about 150,000 employees worldwide, is not the first or the largest to institute such a strict ban. But advocates at the National Safety Council believe Cargill is the largest privately held corporation to do so.\n\nAD\n\nDeborah A.P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. It's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.\n\nThey're really just looking at their risks and looking at the data, Hersman said.\n\nThe National Safety Council says motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of work-related fatalities and account for about 24 percent of all work-related injuries. The nonprofit organization, using 2010 data, estimates that at least 24 percent of all fatal crashes involved drivers using cell phones and that at least 160,000 crashed involved drivers who were texting.\n\nIf anything, driving while texting or talking on a mobile device has become ever more widespread since then. Some experts believe that recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in traffic deaths can be blamed at least in part on the widespread habit of texting or talking while driving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCargill — whose businesses range from agriculture to financial services — decided to act because of the ubiquity of smartphones and a growing number of statistics suggesting that these devices are too often the culprits in traffic crashes, Nelson said. There was no specific incident that caused the company to to implement the policy, she said.\n\nOverall, it's making sure employees know of the dangers of driving while distracted and how important that Cargill feels that safety is first, Nelson said.\n\nEmployees could be disciplined for infractions, with actions ranging from a talk with the boss to termination, but that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, Nelson said. She said the company is relying mostly on an honor system and peers to monitor and enforce the new policy.\n\nAD\n\nRight now, we are focused on stopping distracted driving and less on what the punishments will be for violating the policy, Nelson said. We will look at factors such as how egregious a violation is, if someone is doing it repeatedly, if they have received warnings in the past, and other factors to determine the appropriate consequences.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Safety Council, again citing 2010 figures, says 20 percent of the Fortune 500 companies imposed total bans. Some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as Pokemon Go, are not on them, Hersman said. And a survey cited by the Council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.\n\nThere's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. Hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. Some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.\n\nAD\n\nBut a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. Over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.\n\nAD\n\nOne company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a Saturday night. In a 2010 case in Texas cited by the Council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.\n\nSo it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. A National Safety Council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.\n\nAD\n\nBut at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. Hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as Cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use. At one time, smoking was accepted almost everywhere, and now it's not. And people are no longer shy about asking others to put out the cigarette. Hersman said she hopes that eventually, more Americans will no longer view texting while driving as acceptable behavior, either.\n\nAD\n\nYou really have to change your mindset to put your employees' safety and the safety of others on the road first, she said.
Adam Staveski, 22, policy analyst, and Maddie Csere, 22, financial analyst. (Photo courtesy of daters)\n\nInterviews by Amanda McGrath\n\nPolicy analyst Adam Staveski, 22, and financial analyst Maddie Csere, also 22, are fresh-faced and fresh out of local colleges, enjoying their first year as D.C. young professionals. We sent them to Maple in Columbia Heights to see if a shared love of running, economics and a laid-back attitude was enough to spark a fresh romance.\n\nMaddie: I was freaking out all week — this is a little out of my comfort zone. I almost didn't come. But within 30 seconds, I was like, This is going to be absolutely fine.\n\nAdam: She was exactly my type. She's very pretty, she's friendly and gregarious — our personalities seemed to click right off the bat.\n\nMaddie: I know exactly why they paired me with him: He's tall, athletic, has a slimmer build, which is what I said my type was.\n\nAdam:We could pick up the conversation like we were old friends.\n\nMaddie: He was very kind and definitely excited to be there, which made me excited to be there.\n\nAdam: We both grew up in small-town environments [and] came to D.C. for college.\n\nMaddie: We both studied economics. He told me about his job, and it was really cool and interesting. I don't get to talk to other econ people that often.\n\nAdam: My job is very niche — most people think it's the most boring thing of all time. I was glad she didn't think it was super lame.\n\nMaddie: I went to [George Washington University] and he went to American University; we talked about D.C. school rivalries.\n\nAdam: It seems like everyone hates Georgetown, but it's like [American] is rivals with [GWU], jockeying for position as the second-best school in D.C.\n\nMaddie: I don't know. I don't really believe in the school rivalries.\n\nAdam: She said, No, people at GW don't care. I was like, shoot, maybe American kids are way more petty. [Laughs.]\n\nMaddie: He's a really good runner. I recently ran a marathon for the first time; he ran the Marine Corps in an insane time and is running [in] Boston next year.\n\nAdam: She asked for my time and I said I ran 2:43. She was astounded. I was like, Nice, she's impressed!\n\nMaddie: We talked about meeting famous people. I was obsessed with One Direction at one point in my life and met Harry Styles after waiting outside the British Fashion Awards for four hours. It was ridiculous. [Adam] was on The Daily Show once; they came up to him on the street and interviewed him for a segment.\n\nAdam: We both found out — weird fact — we're both missing our front teeth.\n\nMaddie: We both have fake teeth — I'm pretty sure that's not something I put in my application.\n\nAdam: She's very genuine. I'm like, Wow, you are a cool, amazing, interesting person that I'm excited to talk to.\n\nMaddie: He's one of the most genuinely nice people I've ever met in my whole life. If you meet him, you immediately know he's not a very judgmental person.\n\nAdam: There seemed to be depth to her. She's not predictable. We delved briefly into politics, and rather than being a staunch partisan, she's able to look at situations with a lot of nuance, more so than a lot of people in the D.C. area.\n\nMaddie: We align a bit [politically], but my family is a little divided, so I was talking about how growing up in rural Michigan gives me a different perspective.\n\nAdam: I would say the overall vibe was more friendly than flirtatious. It's hard on a first date to really give out too strong of a signal without it being weird.\n\nMaddie: I got more of a friend vibe from our conversation. There wasn't totally a spark there, [but also] I'm not quick to fall for people. I'm still processing things.\n\nAdam: Both of us were surprised by the time we left that we'd been there so long.\n\nMaddie: We sat for three hours, and I really didn't think it had been that long. It was 10:30 at that point; I'm normally home by 8 on weeknights. We left and he walked me to the Metro, even though it was out of his way.\n\nAdam: I walked her back to the Metro and asked for her phone number.\n\nMaddie: I hugged him and then we left. He texted me that night to make sure I got home okay.\n\nAdam: I'd personally be interested in a second date. I'm on a quest to go to every Metro station on the map; she seemed interested in that, so maybe it could be an informal, casual way to see if there's something there.\n\nMaddie: I could see us being pretty good friends in the future; he's such a nice human, which is kind of rare to find at our age. I don't think we clicked romantically, but I'm not sure — my thoughts aren't very clear on this yet.\n\nRate the date\n\nAdam: A 4.5 [out of 5]. It was an extremely pleasant evening. I left feeling very happy.\n\nMaddie: A solid 3.5. I really, really liked talking to him. It didn't feel like a date totally for me, but it was a great night.\n\nUpdate\n\nThey've stayed in touch via text; a second date is possible, they say, but so far they haven't set any plans.
1. How does the system work?\n\nIt's an opaque process. Vietnam has a collective four pillar leadership structure made up of general secretary, prime minister, president and chair of the National Assembly, the nation's parliament. It governs in consultation with a 17- to 19-member politburo. Nguyen Phu Trong, the current general secretary, also became president in 2018 following the death of President Tran Dai Quang, meaning the top leadership was down to three. Observers anticipate the government will revert to four pillars in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. Who chooses what?\n\nThe 13th National Party Congress is scheduled to be held Jan. 25 through Feb. 2. About 1,600 delegates from across the country will vote to select about 200 members to the Central Committee, which in turn will pick the politburo and from that group the party general secretary. The politburo will then nominate candidates for prime minister and the cabinet. These will go to a vote in the National Assembly mid-year.\n\n3. Who's in contention for the top job?\n\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, 66, who has won plaudits for guiding the country through the pandemic relatively unscathed, may be in the running for the party chief. His chief rival could be the incumbent's protege, Tran Quoc Vuong, 67, head of the party's central office, who spearheaded Trong's aggressive anti-corruption campaign. Trong, 76, may even pursue another full or partial third term. Possible contenders for other top jobs:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n• Vuong Dinh Hue, 63, a former minister of finance, deputy prime minister and head of the Party's Central Economic Commission, may be in the running for prime minister.\n\n• Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, 61, who holds a master's degree from Tufts University in the U.S. and is also deputy prime minister, is a possible candidate for president.\n\n• Truong Thi Mai, 62, a Central Committee member, could be the second woman elected as chair of the National Assembly.\n\n4. What challenges await?\n\nOn the one hand, boosting growth in the export-dependent nation following a sharp global recession. On the other, doing so without further upsetting the U.S., its biggest export market. The U.S. put Vietnam on notice in October by opening a trade investigation into its currency policy and then imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties on Vietnamese car and truck tires, citing an undervalued currency. In December, the U.S. Treasury designated the Southeast Asian country a currency manipulator, which comes with no immediate penalties but can escalate trade tensions. Vietnam's authorities will be keen to secure greater access to American consumers while tamping down concerns about the surging trade surplus, on pace in 2020 to break the previous year's record $56 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n5. How has Covid-19 affected the country?\n\nAt year-end Vietnam had one of the lowest virus death counts globally, having contained the pathogen. However, economic growth slowed to 2.91% at the end of 2020 as the global downturn brought on by the pandemic sapped demand for made-in-Vietnam products, from smartphones to dress shirts. The government forecasts a 2021 expansion of about 6% compared with 7.02% in 2019.\n\n6. What about superpower relations?\n\nVietnam depends on China for key materials and equipment to supply its factories. Yet relations with its powerful neighbor -- the two countries fought a brief border war in 1979 -- are fraught and further inflamed because of competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Vietnam's coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, or 2,100 miles, follows one of the world's busiest sea cargo lanes.) Vietnam favors greater U.S. economic and military presence in the region to counter China's growing might and is expected to push for a close relationship with the Biden administration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n7. How are Vietnamese faring?\n\nAs decades of market-oriented economic reforms boost incomes and nurture a growing middle class, Vietnam is among the world's most optimistic countries, according to a Nielsen survey. Yet human rights advocates criticize restrictions of basic political and civil freedoms. Arrests and trials of Vietnamese who speak out on issues such as corruption have grown markedly following a new cybersecurity law in 2019, according to Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia. There's typically an up-tick in arrests before the party congress, he said.\n\n8. What will a new government mean for investors?\n\nAD\n\nMore of the same. Vietnam's successful handling of the pandemic, improving infrastructure, investor-friendly policies, political stability and its well-educated, young and low-cost workforce is likely to continue attracting international companies. Expect further efforts by the new leadership to sell Vietnam as an increasingly high-tech manufacturing base for suppliers of global giants such as Apple Inc. One concern for companies will be the risk that the trade rift with the U.S. could trigger additional tariffs.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
It sounds like the Broncos want to have their cake and eat it, too, getting Romo without giving up anything to the Cowboys in return. That may prove impossible, as Dallas is well aware of the highly valuable commodity of which it is in possession, given the NFL's perpetual shortage of quality starting quarterbacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, holding on to Romo while waiting for just the perfect moment to deal him to another team that suddenly finds itself with a need at his position, as the Eagles did in trading Sam Bradford to the Vikings just before the regular season started, could prove problematic for the Cowboys. Beginning with offseason training activities in the spring, every day that Romo spends with the team will provide opportunities for reporters to ask him, owner Jerry Jones and everyone else in Dallas how they feel about the awkward situation.\n\nRomo, who graciously turned the quarterbacking reins over to rookie Dak Prescott in November, would surely be upset with such a hardball strategy by his longtime team. In addition, Romo is close with Jones, who may feel that, as matter of courtesy and respect, he owes it to the 36-year-old to simply release him and let him choose his own team. Another possibility is that Dallas hangs on to Romo, as a valuable and well-paid insurance policy, but again, Jones risks tension in his locker room.\n\nIn 2012, the Colts released Peyton Manning, knowing that they were set to draft Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick. Another factor in that decision was that Indianapolis had salary-cap issues while Manning was set to make a huge amount of money (he was due a $28 million roster bonus), which also made him nearly impossible to trade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, once Manning was released, he eventually landed with the Broncos, which worked out very well for everyone in Denver. Coming off multiple neck surgeries, the decorated quarterback not only rewrote the record book but won a Super Bowl in February 2016.\n\nIt's not hard to see a similar dynamic playing with Romo, who recovered this season from a back injury, not the first of his career. The Broncos still have a terrific defense, talent at wide receiver and running back and, just as importantly, a potential need at his position and the ability to absorb a hefty contract.\n\nDenver drafted a quarterback, Memphis's Paxton Lynch, in the first round last year, but it gave the bulk of the starts this past season to an unheralded second-year player, Trevor Siemian. The Northwestern product acquitted himself respectably, but he led a struggling offense that was called out by members of the Broncos' defense, and there is little doubt that a healthy Romo would represent an upgrade, at least for a couple of seasons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven that Siemian and Lynch are both playing on rookie contracts, the Broncos should be able to accommodate Romo's salary, which will be $14 million next year, after which he will have two more seasons left on a six-year, $108 million contract. The website Spotrac lists Denver as having $38,410,833 in 2017 salary-cap space, and teams can usually find ways of freeing up more room when necessary.\n\nThe Denver Post's Mark Kiszla recently asked in a column advocating the acquisition of Romo, Can Denver really afford to waste another year of this championship defense with a young quarterback not ready for prime time? Gary Kubiak tried that bluff this year, and it ended with ugly shouting in a locker room divided by the frustration of seven losses.
This Sunday, Feb. 4, will mark the one-year anniversary of the death of student Timothy Piazza. The university continues to mourn his tragic passing. In the immediate aftermath, it became clear wholesale changes were needed to create a sustainable Greek system. We resolved to turn the pain and anguish radiating through our community into decisive reform.\n\nOver the past year, the university instituted extensive new measures , which depart significantly from the Greek system's self-governance model. We are making progress:\n\nThe university assumed control of the fraternity and sorority organizational misconduct and adjudication process, and established a team of monitors who perform regular spot checks. These compliance checks have surfaced violations of our new safety rules and resulted in several chapters receiving sanctions.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the university held a signing ceremony with 70 Greek organization leaders representing 49 chapters and the four governing councils . . . acknowledging the expectations that the university has for its Greek organizations and members.\n\nWe instituted our new deferred recruitment policy. Now, new students may not rush a sorority or fraternity until they have completed a full semester. Many sorority students report that waiting to rush this past semester was helpful, because they adjusted to academic and social life on campus, and are now better prepared to consider participation in Greek life.\n\nTo help students and their families make more informed decisions about Greek life at Penn State, we instituted a scorecard that reviews the performance of each chapter.\n\nUniversity-hired chapter monitors are working with representatives of each fraternity house with respect to their chapter's specific risk-management programs. Risk-management programs must be in place and approved by the university and must include details on how our restrictions on the size of gatherings, our ban on hard liquor and various other required safety protocols will be implemented. The university must approve each plan before any socials involving alcohol are permitted.\n\nOur campus police participate in joint nightly patrols with State College Police as part of the Neighborhood Enforcement Alcohol Team at University Park. These patrols have detected safety violations and helped to hold students and chapters accountable for unsafe behavior.\n\nOur zero tolerance rule for serious hazing is in place, and will result in the permanent revocation of recognition of any chapter found to have violated the university's requirements.\n\nThese measures are making a difference. I am encouraged that we have received letters from our local community about improved chapter behavior in State College. Local law enforcement and others report reduced crowd sizes at fraternity gatherings. Fraternity and sorority leaders are working more closely with the university to implement the new safety programs. This is important progress.\n\nUnfortunately, however, significant problems remain. In addition to the permanent Beta Theta Pi ban, a total of 13 other Greek organizations at Penn State have received multiyear suspensions for safety violations. While these consequences demonstrate that we mean business, the large number of suspended chapters also shows that many students have ignored the call for behavior change and fallen short of our values and expectations.\n\nOne of the underlying tenets of belonging to a community is the shared responsibility for the safety and well-being of its members.\n\nTo that end, as we approach the one-year anniversary of a terrible tragedy we must do more:\n\nAll of our students, as adults, must recognize the importance of safety and make changes in your own lives that will create a safer community.\n\nOur Greek-letter community needs to embrace the need for change and rededicate yourselves to a mission of service and community. We must do better.\n\nNational Greek organizations absolutely must assume leadership responsibility. Three chapters that lost university recognition, Alpha Chi Rho, Alpha Sigma Phi and Sigma Alpha Mu, did not receive chapter suspensions from their national offices. That is unacceptable.\n\nParents and Greek alumni should provide a much higher level of support to their chapters and provide guidance and mentoring. Sadly, we found in our monitoring that parents of students in some chapters helped students violate the law and university rules against alcohol consumption.\n\nWe must set a national example for reform. To that end, on April 23 and 24, I look forward to gathering university presidents, provosts and student affairs leaders from across the country to begin to explore ideas for cooperative action.\n\nWe also continue to work with Pennsylvania and federal legislators toward stricter hazing penalties. In short, we will not rest in our efforts, with the hope that this kind of tragedy never occurs again.\n\nThank you for your attention, and for your commitment to these efforts. Much remains to be done, and the memory of Timothy Piazza deserves nothing less than our collective action.
The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.\n\nThe combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.\n\nThere are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.\n\nUnemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.\n\nThis intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.\n\nSomething we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.\n\nAll of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.\n\nTurning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.\n\nThis is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.\n\nSecond, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.
Many foreign observers, already glued to news of the final chapters of the election saga, reacted with alarm and even grief, especially in allied countries that have looked to U.S. democracy for inspiration.\n\nThe United States Congress has been the symbol of freedom and democracy around the world for centuries, tweeted Armin Laschet, the leader of Germany's most populous federal state. The attacks on the Capitol by fanatical Trump supporters hurt every friend of the United States.\n\nLeaders around the world condemned the pro-Trump mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and reaffirmed their faith in American democracy. (The Washington Post)\n\nAcross much of Europe, top officials echoed these sentiments. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the scenes of chaos disgraceful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canada's News 1130 radio station in Vancouver that his government is concerned and following the situation minute by minute.\n\nI think the American democratic institutions are strong, and hopefully everything will return to normal shortly, he said.\n\nThe surge of reactions from allies and foreign observers illustrated one of the Trump era's key consequences, which has become only more apparent as it winds to a chaotic close: The beleaguered but persistent role of the United States as a model for democratic norms and institutions — in its own self-conception and in the eyes of friends — has been severely tarnished.\n\nAD\n\nIn the view of the world, the Trump era provided no shortage of captivating spectacle, sometimes grim. Wednesday's events went beyond that, into disconcerting territory: far-right attacks on democracy made literal. Chilling footage from the scene circulated globally, of lawmakers fleeing, Capitol Police with their guns drawn inside the Capitol building and a mob of angry Trump supporters running loose in the halls. One photo showed a man sitting in the chair of a member of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) staff, his feet on the desk. Another showed a man appearing to carry away the speaker's lectern.\n\nAD\n\nThe turmoil also gave an opening for countries with poor track records on human rights and democracy to lecture a superpower.\n\nTurkey, a NATO ally that has been widely condemned for jailing thousands of critics, academics, journalists and artists and has seen its partnership with the United States deteriorate in recent years, called on all parties in the U.S.A. to show restraint and common sense, in a statement released by its Foreign Ministry.\n\nAD\n\nIn Venezuela — which has been embroiled in political and social crises for years — Jorge Arreaza, the foreign minister in authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro's government, issued a statement condemning the political polarization and the spiral of violence that reflects the profound political and social crisis the United States is currently experiencing.\n\nAD\n\nJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader who was supported by the Trump administration in his claim to the interim presidency of Venezuela, said the attack on the Capitol was an attack on democracy. My thoughts are with the citizens and officials who feel the roots of their country were attacked.\n\nDmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, also took the opportunity to allege U.S. hypocrisy.\n\nAD\n\nAllies struck a different tone.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, described the situation as utterly horrifying and called for solidarity with those … on the side of democracy and the peaceful and constitutional transfer of power. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tweeted that the people of Ireland have a deep connection with the United States and that many, like me, will be watching the scenes unfolding in Washington DC with great concern and dismay.\n\nAD\n\nEnemies of democracy will be happy to see these unbelievable pictures from #WashingtonDC. Riotous words turn into violent acts — on the steps of the Reichstag, and now in the #Capitol, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted, referring to far-right protesters who rushed the historic German parliament building in August. The disdain for democratic institutions is devastating.\n\nAD\n\nSome foreign outlets, including the BBC and the Australian newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald, maintained live coverage of Wednesday's developments in Washington.\n\nMany eyes were already turned on the United States, as foreign observers tracked the closely contested runoff Senate race in Georgia. By Wednesday afternoon, both Democratic candidates, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, had been declared winners — tipping the Senate to the Democrats, thereby granting the party control of both the White House and Congress.\n\nAD\n\nHow I would like to be a voter of the #DekalbCounty in #Georgia! And vote #Ossoff, former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta tweeted earlier in the day, referring to a Georgia county with a large number of Democratic voters.\n\nAD\n\nU. S. and international politics over the next few years will depend on his victory, he wrote. Those votes will affect us too.\n\nLetta has been a vocal critic of Trump's handling of the election. When Trump tweeted, STOP THE COUNT the day after polls closed in November, Letta responded, IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY!\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described a man sitting at the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The story has been updated to correct that the man was sitting at the desk of a member of Pelosi's staff.
With that in mind, an intriguing possibility emerged: What if the ultimate goal of that trade was to pry Jimmy Garoppolo away from the Patriots?\n\nAmong others proposing that scenario was Mary Kay Cabot, a longtime Browns beat writer. The Browns have the ammunition to acquire Jimmy Garoppolo and will try to put together a strong package that the Patriots will accept, she wrote at cleveland.com.\n\nAs Cabot noted on Twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for Tony Romo to possibly join the Texans. Having lured Osweiler away from the Broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, Houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. Osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup Tom Savage, and the Texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land Romo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Browns signaled that they don't have much use for Osweiler, either, with football operations chief Sashi Brown starting off his official statement on the deal with, We're really excited to acquire a second-round draft choice in this trade.\n\nDraft picks are extremely important to our approach in building a championship caliber football team, Brown added. We are intent on adding competition to every position on our roster and look forward to having Brock come in and compete.\n\nIt Cleveland doesn't turn around and trade Osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — Osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. That may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what NBA teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the NFL, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. In any event, if it helps land the highly regarded Garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the Browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA second-round pick in 2014, Garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when Tom Brady was serving his Deflategate suspension. The 25-year-old completed 68.3 of his passes for 502 yards, four touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 113.3 rating, showing impressive decision-making and pocket presence.\n\nWith the 39-year-old Brady's play showing no signs of deterioration en route to a championship season, the Patriots have the luxury of dangling Garoppolo for a king's ransom or simply keeping him for one more season as an excellent insurance policy against a possible Brady injury. New England recently signaled it was more than willing to take the latter approach, but that could be a negotiating stance.\n\nCabot and others had already reported that the Browns were interested in trading for Garoppolo, and it's entirely possible that the Patriots have been playing hardball with them behind the scenes. Cleveland holds the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, but understandably wants to keep it. The Browns also have the No. 12 pick, which could be in play but possibly not enough to get a deal done.\n\nNow the Browns have another high-value pick to offer, even after amassing a war chest that includes two second-rounders this year and 11 selections altogether. They also have extra picks in 2018's fourth and sixth rounds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf there's an NFL team known for a strategy of stocking up on draft picks, it's the Patriots, who have often traded back from their first-round positions, sometimes to the dismay of their fans (although they obviously can't complain much about the results). Could this year's No. 12 pick, plus a second-rounder, get them to give up Garoppolo? How about three second-round picks? We may find out, but the team can hardly expect to see a stronger offers than those for an essentially still-unproven player.
Intel Drops Plans for ID Numbers By Robert O'Harrow Jr. and Elizabeth Corcoran\n\nWashington Post Staff Writers\n\nTuesday, January 26, 1999; Page E1 Intel Corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the Internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. The turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott Intel products in protest of the chip's ID component. This is a significant victory for privacy, said Barry Steinhardt, associate director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who praised Intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. They did it on Internet time. In announcing the ID feature of the new Pentium III microprocessor last week, Intel officials described it as an important step for Internet security. The ID number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. While each chip still will have a unique number, Intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the ID function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif., company, acknowledged that Intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. We're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, Mulloy said. You must account for privacy if you're going to have security. But some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. Computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. Instead, users must electronically fetch the program from Intel's Web site. In addition, the utility program is available only for Windows software. -Those who use the Linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. Privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the World Wide Web – in essence, allowing businesses at those Web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other Web sites. The default for privacy should be no ID number, said David Banisar, policy director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a advocacy group in Washington that helped organize the Intel boycott. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. I have great concerns about any unique identifier Web sites might use without any rules, said Markey, who wrote a letter to Intel complaining about the chip last week. © Copyright The Washington Post Company Back to the top
AD\n\nPlenty of that is going to happen behind the scenes, but we already know what many of the campaign benchmarks will be this year. The political calendar is slowly filling in, and the window for candidates to announce is fairly narrow; no one who went on to win his or her party's nomination in this century announced (or formed an exploratory committee) any later than April the year before the election.\n\nAD\n\nJan. 18-21: The AFL-CIO will hold its Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference, which is open to 2020 contenders; there's little buzz about this so far, but it has the potential to be the Democrats' first cattle call, and the AFL-CIO has the clout to call Democrats in whenever it wants.\n\nJan. 19: The third Women's March will take place around the country, with special plans for Washington, where organizers are putting together a lobbying day focused on getting a House vote on Medicare-for-all and where they'll release a Women's Agenda, This will be the first of these marches since a battery of controversies for the umbrella Women's March organization, especially of the association between one organizer and Louis Farrakhan. But most Democrats with presidential ambitions have spoken at previous marches and are expected to again.\n\nAD\n\nJan. 31-Feb. 3: The Republican National Committee meets in Washington, where it will continue to clarify its 2020 primary rules, amid serious discussion of altering them to make any challenge to President Trump impossible.\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 13-16: The Democratic National Committee meets, also in Washington, and will make one of the final big decisions before the primary: the site of the 2020 convention. In the past, this meeting has also drawn in a few presidential contenders, though changes to primary rules have diminished the delegate voting power of DNC members.\n\nFeb. 22: New Hampshire's McIntyre-Shaheen Dinner will unfold in Manchester. It's likely to be the first cattle call in an early voting state, coming after a number of first-tier candidates have entered the race.\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 27-March 2: The annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, will be held again in suburban Washington. Trump has appeared there every year since entering the 2016 Republican primary, and the local reception for him has evolved from contempt (2016) to jubilation (2017) to outright adoration (2018).\n\nAD\n\nMarch 10-13: The annual International Association of Fire Fighters conference comes to D.C., and the first day typically takes place in a ballroom near the Capitol, with prominent politicians invited to speak on any topic to members. The union's longtime president Harold Schaitberger has already all but pledged to back Joe Biden if he enters the race.\n\nMarch 24-26: One of the largest annual political events in the country, the AIPAC Policy Conference, will be held in downtown Washington. Traditionally, the off-year sessions don't give many speaking slots to presidential candidates; that's reserved for election years. But the event, anchored by a lengthy speech from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is built to showcase the clout of pro-Israel lobbyists, and worries about declining support for Israel among Democratic voters have become a topic there.\n\nAD\n\nMarch 31: It's the end of the first fundraising quarter, the first traditional gut check and re-sorting of any presidential field. In the 2008 cycle, this was the moment when Barack Obama nearly matched Hillary Clinton's money haul, firming up the idea that he was a credible challenger. Note that Obama announced his numbers in the first week of April; campaigns are not required to turn everything in to the Federal Election Commission until April 15, but increasingly, campaigns like to get a jump on the official filing and calculate their totals for the press.\n\nAD\n\nLate April: One of the last Fridays in this month is devoted to House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry, an annual event that stands out for Democrats for a simple reason: It's the biggest political gathering for African American voters in an early primary state.\n\nMay 21: Statewide primaries will take place in Kentucky, one of three states that will elect a governor this year. In 2015, eventual Democratic nominee Jack Conway spent the whole campaign evading questions about who he'd back for president, saying he would support Joe Biden, who was not running. Why should a candidate for governor answer that question? It's fair to ask, but tying the Democratic candidate to his national party has become a go-to tactic for Republicans here. Any Democrat who wants to prove his or her strength outside of blue America will be paying attention.\n\nAD\n\nMay 31-June 2: The California Democratic Party Convention is happening in San Francisco this year, and, for the first time since 2008, the state has secured an early slot on the primary calendar. That's likely to turn this into a showcase for multiple Democrats, in a forum where a good speech, in front of a massive audience, can get national attention. It was here in 2003 that Howard Dean pronounced himself a member of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party and assailed Democrats who'd backed the Iraq War.\n\nAD\n\nJune: The first official Democratic presidential primary debate will take place, location to be determined. The DNC has sanctioned six debates in 2019, all of them to be held outside the first four primary states. That means, in practice, that the candidates who make it onstage will burn 12 to 18 days this year on prep, travel and the debates themselves.\n\nMid-June: Mitt Romney's annual donor summit is expected to celebrate its fifth year in Park City, Utah, — the first, obviously, with the host representing the state as a senator. There will be several moments when Republicans ask (or the press prods them to ask) if the party can go into 2020 with Trump still leading it; this will be the most scenic of those moments.\n\nAD\n\nJune 30: The end of the second fundraising quarter, which can be a winnowing moment for candidates who have not yet shown any ability to stack money.\n\nAD\n\nJuly. The NAACP Convention will take place in Detroit; typically, the event includes a candidate forum where presidential contenders get equal time to speak and are encouraged to discuss civil rights.\n\nJuly 11-13: The 14th Netroots Nation conference will take place in Philadelphia; for the third time, it will feature some sort of forum for Democratic presidential candidates. In 2007, that took the form of a debate, which made some news when Hillary Clinton got into an argument about lobbyists (they represent real Americans). In 2015 it became a series of Q&As with the candidates who had bothered to show up; both Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders were interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists. This year, organizers say the format is to be determined.\n\nAD\n\nAug. 8-18: It's the most cliche-rich event in politics: the Iowa State Fair. It's also a focusing event for candidates, who are given time at a Des Moines Register-sponsored soapbox to deliver their stump speech.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 2: Multiple primary states will be holding Labor Day events; the AFL-CIO's breakfast in New Hampshire has frequently become a go-to event for Democrats that day. (Sanders has attended it every year since 2016.)\n\nMid-September: The New Hampshire Democratic Party holds its convention in Manchester, giving candidates the biggest captive audience they'll have in that state until the new year.\n\nSept. 28: Since 2017, the last Saturday of the month has been given over to the Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry, a successor to the Iowa candidate cattle call that former senator Tom Harkin held for years.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 30: This is the end of the third fundraising quarter, and by this point in previous cycles, candidates who've struggled have seen their futures and dropped out. In 2011 and 2015, the first two Republican primaries in the era of the super PAC, several candidates plowed forward despite raising nearly nothing for their own campaigns. The toxicity of big money PACs in Democratic politics is likely to alter that trend.\n\nAD\n\nOctober: Iowa Democrats will hold their Fall Dinner, formerly known as the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. This was the event that turned Obama into the Iowa front-runner, after months of slogging through and underperforming at candidate forums.\n\nDec. 31: Every New Year's Eve before the Iowa caucuses marks the end of the fourth fundraising quarter; by Jan. 15, just a few weeks before voting, every candidate will have revealed his and her totals for the year. Then, and only then, will we know who endured the marathon, who ran out of money, and who kept raising money after being completely written off. And we're just 363 days away.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nWarren's Iowa adventure. Since the Massachusetts senator's last visit to Iowa, in 2014, a few parts of the state have grown a bit bluer. There's a lot more of Iowa that's gotten redder — and that's where Warren will be going.\n\nThree of Warren's five scheduled stops this weekend will take her to the 4th Congressional District, represented by Republican Steve King. Pottawattamie County backed Trump by 21 points, Woodbury County by 20 points, Buena Vista County by 24 points. And all went by double digits for Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) in last year's statewide elections. Just 10 years ago, Barack Obama had lost them by only a few points.\n\nThat itinerary has turned some heads in Iowa. I'm excited that with so many people focused on Des Moines and urban areas, that she's coming out here, said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who narrowly lost to King last year. She's going to hear about health care. She's going to talk to people who are worried about market consolidation and how farmers are being squeezed, both on the input side and the output side.\n\nScholten, who ran 14 points ahead of Hillary Clinton in the district, had campaigned with a number of lesser-known Democrats with presidential ambitions. Warren, he said, had sent three fundraising letters on behalf of his campaign; when he was at the 2018 Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans, Warren made time for a meeting with him.\n\nMost of Warren's events are being promoted as organizing gatherings, as opposed to policy listening tour stops of the sort Clinton made in 2015. One is a roundtable in Storm Lake, a city in Buena Vista County, but Iowa Democrats point out that there's a unique local story there.\n\nI'm proud of her for choosing Storm Lake, said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democratic Party. It's one of the few Iowa cities that's growing, and it's because it's been very welcoming to immigrants. It's known as a melting pot in rural Iowa; I'd love to see more Democrats heading there.\n\nBut after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to Iowa, the stakes for Warren are high. This is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. Warren's first event on Saturday is at one of Sioux City's largest arts venues, one that Clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. Turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another Democrat who may run for president.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nNancy Pelosi is once again the speaker of the House, returning to the job after eight years despite 15 members of her party not voting for her. What matters for 2020 is that 20 Democrats in districts carried by the president backed the new speaker; Republicans, who need to win at least 19 seats to flip the House, immediately painted targets on them.\n\nWith the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them, said Dan Conston, the new president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, in a statement from the Republican super PAC. CLF will make sure voters know that their member of Congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch San Francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.\n\nThere's actually a spirited disagreement among Republicans about whether this attack works; Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the new chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, has worried that the obsessive focus on Pelosi in 2018 did little to boost Republicans outside of very safe districts.\n\nAnd the 20 Pelosi-backing Trump district Democrats really fit into two camps. One camp come from places where Trump performed more weakly than previous Republican nominees: Reps. Tom O'Halleran (Ariz.), Lucy McBath (Ga.), Lauren Underwood (Ill.), Haley Stevens (Mich.), Angie Craig (Minn.), Josh Gottheimer (Mass.) and Kendra Horn (Okla.).\n\nThe remaining 13 Democrats come from a range of districts, from the most Trump-friendly place represented by a Democrat (Minnesota's 7th) to Nevada's 3rd District, where Trump actually won a smaller share of the vote than Mitt Romney; third-party voters were responsible for his win margin.\n\nThe point: If Republicans knocked off every Democrat from a red-tinted district who voted for Pelosi today, and reelected every one of their incumbents, they'd come out of 2020 with a majority. But the map isn't that simple.\n\nStill, Republicans ended their first day of divided government by promising to hold pro-Pelosi Democrats accountable. America Rising blasted out a list of 21 Democrats who went back on their word to back Pelosi that included 11 from increasingly blue districts carried by Clinton. The House GOP's own rapid-response team called out 11 Democrats, nine of whom won in safe blue seats.\n\nAlso worth noting: While a few Democrats pledged specifically not to back Pelosi, many more found routes around the Pelosi question, saying that they wanted to see new leadership, or see who was seeking the gavel — and then, after the election, saying that Pelosi had won them over.\n\n2020\n\nBernie Sanders. The New York Times published the most comprehensive investigation so far of allegations of sexual harassment against staffers in the senator's 2016 campaign, an issue that had been bubbling under the surface for months. Sanders, who dislikes discussing scandal or campaign details more than most politicians, appeared on CNN on Wednesday and said that he supported changes in harassment reporting policy; then, he added that he was a little busy on the trail and thus unaware of the details as harassment was reported.\n\nTom Steyer. The next three stops on his five rights tour are Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada; he announced as much last month but clarified this week that the Iowa stop will be in Des Moines.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. She told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that she will decide soon on a 2020 bid.\n\nTerry McAuliffe. He published an op-ed in The Post today, urging Democrats to run on realistic solutions in 2020 — one way of saying they risked swinging too far to the left.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She sat down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night, making news when she criticized the foreign policy establishment that had criticized the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, though she said that the president's process for doing so was too slapdash.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nMedicare-for-all. It's official: The new Democratic House will hold hearings on single-payer health care, for the first time in decades — the first time, ever, that the current version of Medicare-for-all will go through the committee process.\n\nThat does not mean that the dream of the modern left will become law this year. But advocates know that. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the sponsor of the House legislation, said having public hearings and traditional scoring for the bill will elevate it as a 2020 issue.\n\nIt will ensure that this will be part of the 2020 presidential platforms, said Jayapal. We will be looking at every single candidate from this lens.\n\nWithin hours of Jayapal's announcement, potential 2020 candidates were celebrating. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), arriving at a party held for supporters Wednesday, told them that the House would be doing what cynics called impossible just years earlier.\n\nI want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare-for-all, he told The Post. I'm confident the results will show that Medicare-for-all is the way forward if we want to guarantee health care to all people in a cost-effective way.\n\nLeft-wing activists will step up their advocacy for Medicare-for-all in the coming days, with rallies for the policy around the Jan. 19 Women's March. MoveOn is also about to distribute a memo, written by Data for Progress, that crunched data from the 2018 election to argue that Democrats running on the policy were not effectively attacked for it by Republicans.\n\nNeither polling data nor actual election results suggest that embracing Medicare for All or the broader progressive agenda hurt Democratic politicians in 2018, Data for Progress concludes in the memo.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nFor the first time in decades, the House of Representatives opened a new session with one vacant seat — the 9th District of North Carolina. Mark Harris, the Republican who declared victory in that race in November, spent Thursday filing a motion in Wake County Superior Court, asking to be certified as a member of Congress.\n\nThe voters of the Ninth Congressional District are entitled to have their elected representative in place by the time Congress convenes, Harris's attorneys wrote in their brief for the court.\n\nUnfortunately for Harris, that's not how this works. Democrats, whose majority gives them the power to seat or refuse to seat new members, have been adamant: There will be no member from this district until there is a judgment on allegations that Harris paid a Republican operative to discard ballots that could have swung the election.\n\nWhat could happen next? North Carolina Republicans, who now say that Harris should be seated, are sticking with him and filing lawsuits on his behalf, attempting to move the matter to federal court. But if they lose there, a law passed by the Republican-run legislature would mandate any vacancy to be filled in a special election, preceded by a primary. One potential timeline: Both parties pick their nominees in a late spring primary, then elect a new congressman as late as November.\n\nThis would not be the longest vacancy in recent congressional history; a full year passed between the December 2017 resignation of Michigan's John Conyers and the seating of a Democrat who won the special November 2018 election to replace him. But it could mean that for most of the next year, Republicans have just 199 votes in the House, making it incrementally easier for Democrats to pass bills.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nWhy the New Democratic Majority Could Work Better Than the Last, by Ronald Brownstein\n\nThis point really can't be made enough: For the first time, Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives that does not include a conservative bloc from the South. The median member of the conference is now a center-left suburbanite.\n\nThe piece itself is funny, but it also gets at something that greatly aided Warren this week: As the first credible female candidate in the Democratic race, she endured the first attempts to brand a female candidate as unlikable, and that rallied even some Democrats who don't plan to support her.\n\nYou may already be running, by Alexandra Petri\n\nJust read it.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
But unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when Russians worked to help elect Donald Trump, the people behind the Alabama effort — dubbed Project Birmingham — were Americans. Now Democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in Project Birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.\n\nJones's narrow, upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. Moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in The Post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRecent revelations about Project Birmingham, however, have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign.\n\nAs the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and Facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the Project Birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. Those included a false flag effort that generated phony evidence that automated Russian accounts called bots had supported Moore on Twitter and the creation of a misleading Facebook page, aimed at Alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine Moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival Republican through a write-in campaign.\n\nBut all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProject Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\n\nHoffman gave $750,000 to a progressive technology start-up called American Engagement Technologies — founded by Mikey Dickerson, a former Obama administration official — that aimed to help Democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person said Dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire New Knowledge, a Texas-based social media research firm, to work in Alabama in support of Jones during the special election in December 2017.\n\nDickerson — who is best known for leading the effort to fix HealthCare.gov, the glitchy portal for President Barack Obama's signature health-care initiative — said in a statement to The Post that he learned of the extent of Project Birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI received the report in early 2018, which is when I first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics, Dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.\n\nThat report, he said, came from New Knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. More recently, it co-authored a report last month on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nJonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the Project Birmingham document and disputed Dickerson's claim that New Knowledge authored it.\n\n'Influence the outcome'\n\nWhat is known about Project Birmingham comes mainly from the 12-page document labeled Project Birmingham Debrief, which was obtained by The Post. It is dated Dec. 15, 2017, three days after the Alabama vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe document describes the effort as a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the AL senate race by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing Jones. Jones has said he had no knowledge of Project Birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.\n\nThe goal of the effort was to radicalize Democrats, suppress unpersuadable Republicans (hard Rs) and faction moderate Republicans by advocating for write-in candidates, the document states.\n\nThe document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving enough votes to ensure a Doug Jones victory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolitical analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.\n\nMy initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign I've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started, said University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith.\n\nLast September, Dickerson presented what he said was a truncated version of the Project Birmingham debrief at a meeting of technology experts — several of them alumni of the Obama administration — in downtown Washington. The 13 attendees of that meeting were required to sign nondisclosure agreements.\n\nAD\n\nIn the version of the document distributed at the meeting, a black rectangle obscured part of a sentence that would have made clear the name of the entity that conducted Project Birmingham. After weeks of declining to comment, Dickerson told The Post that the redaction was NK — for New Knowledge.\n\nAD\n\nPrior to presenting the report in September, I edited New Knowledge's report for length and to redact identifying information, Dickerson wrote in his statement to The Post. This was the only firsthand account of this kind of operation that I knew of, so I presented it to the group to analyze and discuss.\n\nDickerson declined to answer numerous other questions about the campaign, including what he knew of Hoffman's role.\n\nSome 'experiments'\n\nBefore Dickerson had sent his statement to The Post, Morgan, the New Knowledge chief, had publicly denied writing the Project Birmingham report or knowing about most of what it describes.\n\nAD\n\nMorgan, in comments to The Post and in a blog post on the self-publishing site Medium, acknowledged conducting some experiments with disinformation tactics during the Alabama election. Those included creating a Facebook page called Alabama Conservative Politics that shared news links with its followers. He also said that New Knowledge spent about $30,000 on targeted Facebook advertising during the Alabama election season and that he bought some retweets to test his ability to lift social media messages.\n\nAD\n\nMorgan characterized the work as a small, limited research project on Facebook while speculating that Project Birmingham as described in the debrief document was a combination of his efforts and those that might have been conducted by others. He described the Project Birmingham document as AET's report — suggesting it had been a product of Dickerson's start-up, American Engagement Technologies, also known as AET.\n\nI acknowledge working with AET, but I don't recognize the claims they're making now, Morgan said on Medium. We did not write the leaked report and we could not have because it didn't reflect our research. The leaked version of the report made a number of claims that did not originate with us.\n\nAD\n\nHoffman also has denied knowing about the operation in Alabama, though he has acknowledged providing the money to AET and apologized for his role in how it was eventually used.\n\nAD\n\nI find the tactics that have been recently reported highly disturbing, Hoffman said in a statement. For that reason, I am embarrassed by my failure to track AET — the organization I did support — more diligently as it made its own decisions to perhaps fund projects that I would reject.\n\nHoffman's financial relationship with AET was brokered by his political adviser, Dmitri Mehlhorn, who heads a group called Investing in US that helps direct Silicon Valley money into left-leaning political causes.\n\nMehlhorn said he too was unaware of key details about Project Birmingham, but he defended the idea of learning from the Russian disinformation operatives at the Internet Research Agency, who backed Trump in the 2016 election and in his first year in the White House, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency engaged in many, many tactics, some of which I think it is appropriate for us to mirror and some of which I think we should disavow. The tactics they engaged in [that] we need to disavow [include] misinformation and promoting racial hatred, Mehlhorn said. The tactics we need to mirror are really good social microtargeting.\n\nAnger after losing in 2016\n\nProject Birmingham had its roots in the anger and frustration Democrats felt after losing the White House and Congress in 2016 — with the assistance, many were convinced, of online disinformation peddled by Russians and also U.S. conservatives active on social media, who pushed damaging but false information about Democrat Hillary Clinton's health, honesty and suitability for office.\n\nOne person who expressed a desire to fight back was Dickerson, according to social media researcher Renee DiResta, who met him at a conference in Chicago in the same month that Trump was inaugurated. Dickerson told her at the time about his desire to create a start-up to battle political disinformation, she said.\n\nThere was a feeling after the Trump election that Democrats hadn't prioritized tech, that Republicans had built this amazing juggernaut machine, said DiResta. The right wing was running a meme war, and there were these crazy dirty tricks. People wanted to build countermeasures.\n\nDiResta briefly advised AET, offering technical guidance and helping them meet potential supporters in the months before Hoffman agreed to fund the company.\n\nDiResta, who also accepted a single share in AET and a seat on its board, said she became concerned with the opaqueness of the project, and severed ties with the company a few months after joining. She became research director at New Knowledge in January 2018 but said that, while she had heard of an experiment in Alabama, she did not know about the tactics.\n\n'The shifting of votes'\n\nWhile debate continues over who did what in Project Birmingham, The Post was able to find some evidence for several of the claims in the explanatory document.\n\nThe document, for example, says it planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet. We then tied that botnet to the Moore campaign digital director, making it appear as if he had purchased the accounts. Morgan denied any knowledge of the incident involving Russian bots.\n\nDuring the campaign, journalists wrote stories about Twitter accounts that appeared to be Russian followers of Moore.\n\nThose accounts were later suspended by Twitter. The Post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the Alabama election describing evidence that Russian bots were supporting Moore. The Project Birmingham document cited an article in the New York Post with the headline Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers.\n\nOther journalists, however, expressed skepticism at the time, noting that the supposed Russian bots made obvious mistakes, leaving profile information in some tweets in Cyrillic, the Russian-language alphabet.\n\nEvidence also supports the document's claims about creating a conservative Facebook page to siphon support away from Moore. In a section headed Splitting Republican votes, the document says that a Facebook page created by Project Birmingham had contact with a Republican write-in candidate beginning on Nov. 18, 2017, and later endorsed this candidate, who was not named.\n\nThe description and timing fits the experience of Mac Watson, the owner of a patio supply store who ran a Republican write-in campaign and said he had communications with a Facebook page beginning on that date.\n\nThe document also describes Project Birmingham helping the unnamed write-in candidate gain new Twitter followers — something Watson recalls as well, with 10,000 suddenly appearing on his account. He also gained some exposure with the help of the operator of the Facebook page, which the document claims acted as a media advisor helping to arrange interviews with news organizations. The document included an image of a Dec. 5 Washington Post story on Watson. The author of that piece, David Weigel, said he does not recall anyone arranging interviews for his story.
It slammed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, saying he was partly to blame because he had changed active shooter policy to say that deputies may enter a building to engage a shooter, indicating it wasn't necessary. Israel has changed the policy again. The report also noted that some sheriff's deputies said they could not remember the last time they underwent training for an active shooter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the report was critical of the school security program operated by Broward County Public Schools. The report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school Feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. Neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. It took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.\n\nThe report starts with this warning:\n\nSchool safety in Florida needs to be improved. We can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on K-12 school campuses. Not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. Safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSDHS) on February 14, 2018.\n\nThe 15-member commission included sheriffs from several Florida counties, including Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who served as chairman. The fathers of three students killed during the rampage were also appointed. The report will be sent to the Florida legislature and governor. The panel interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed a massive amount of evidence, it said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the most controversial recommendation among dozens made by the commission called for training and giving weapons to teachers willing to carry arms. It is not clear how that will be received by administrators, teachers, students and parents. Some of the student survivors of the shooting have become leaders in a national youth gun-control movement, and the Broward County School Board voted in April not to accept state money appropriated for that purpose.\n\nThe South Florida Sun Sentinel quoted Broward County School Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed in the shooting:\n\nTeachers went to school to teach. That is their expertise. Law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage a threat. Unfortunately, that didn't happen on 2/14, but I still think we should leave it in the hands of law enforcement.\n\nThe commission made recommendations it said schools should adopt immediately, including keeping school gates and doors locked when not in use, and making sure school personnel are present when gates and doors are being used. All doors should be locked, too, and teachers should be able to lock them from the inside, with access to the keys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also said every school should have a Code Red plan for emergencies and should train staff to execute that plan and communicate it to everyone at the school.\n\nAnd the panel said school safety requires attention to the mental health of students and acknowledged:\n\nFlorida's mental and behavioral health system is underfunded. Florida needs a better case management system, but no case management system can be effective unless there are effective services through which a person can be managed.
But a fighting force — even one as formidable as the United States military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. For service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. Currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. These choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.\n\nA recent survey of current and former military personnel conducted by my organization, the Collaborative for Student Success, along with the Military Times, a leading publication widely read by active duty and former U.S. military personnel, puts a finer point on the connection between the quality of K-12 education of military-connected children and readiness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than one-third of respondents, 35 percent, said dissatisfaction with a child's education was or is a significant factor in deciding whether to continue military service; 40 percent said they either have declined or would decline a career-advancing job at a different military installation to remain at their current military facility because of high performing schools. When asked, Did moving between states as part of your military service add challenges to your children's education, 70 percent answered yes.\n\nThe vast majority of survey respondents — 90 percent — reported having spent more than five years in the military. They have years of experience and expertise that our armed forces can ill-afford to lose.\n\nTheir core concern is one that all American parents contend with: schools with standards that are inconsistent from district to district or state to state and that, in many instances, don't adequately prepare children for career or college. But what sets military families apart is that, by design, they are highly nomadic. Our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many U.S. military installations. Children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their K-12 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result: Over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. As the Military Child Education Coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality. Military parents are often left to make career-related decisions based on keeping kids in schools they are comfortable with or moving their families and placing kids in unfamiliar schools where they might wind up either ahead of or behind their new classmates.\n\nA new assessment of several states with large military populations found that military families face a number of education obstacles, with the performance of students varying dramatically depending on geography. The Lexington Institute concluded that a shortage of high-quality educational programs for military-connected students, such as Advanced Placement classes in high school, often restricts educational opportunities, negatively impacts educational achievement, causes military families to make tough choices, inhibits quick assimilation into school communities, and can reduce a family's satisfaction with a military career.\n\nThe study focused on four states with large military populations, including Virginia. Among the findings, it noted overall success in the state, which has a wide distribution of military families and has military kids in every district. But it also found that many districts struggle to meet the academic and social emotional needs of military-connected students.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. military leaders are beginning to recognize the readiness connection.\n\nBefore he retired, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno indicated that local school performance would be a factor in the placement of Army units around the country. If state and local officials intend to keep military bases in their communities, Odierno said in 2013, they better start paying attention to the schools that are outside and inside our installations. Because as we evaluate and as we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria. He commissioned a study, highlighting which schools are successful — and which are not — to examine the quality of schools that serve the children of soldiers.\n\nLast year, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter unveiled a policy allowing service members to remain at a particular duty station for an extended period in exchange for extended service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, taking effect next year, creates a tool, the military student identifier number, that will allow schools to keep tabs on test scores, graduation rates and other metrics for military-connected students.
The double-edged advocacy reflects the quandary facing many industry leaders as President Trump continues his unprecedented attempt to overturn the election with the backing of a majority of Republican lawmakers.\n\nBusiness interests covet the check a Republican-controlled Senate would provide on the incoming Biden administration. But the version of the Republican Party many of them once called home — one that took fidelity to the Constitution for granted — is critically endangered. That fact is exemplified by the chaos engulfing the GOP as top party officials take sides over whether Trump's evidence-free claims of massive voter fraud justify his attempt to subvert the vote.\n\nTop CEOs and business groups made explicit their objection to the election challenges.\n\nNearly 200 senior executives signed on to a letter leaning on lawmakers to certify Biden's win in the most significant push yet to ensure Trump's assault on the election outcome falls short, Josh Dawsey reports. Signers included a wide array of executives of Fortune 500 companies, from the leaders of banks, airlines, investment firms, pharmaceutical companies, professional sports leagues, real estate conglomerates, top law firms and media companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the finance titans adding their names to the letter, organized by the Partnership for New York City: Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga; BlackRock CEO Larry Fink; Blackstone president Jonathan Gray; Lazard CEO Kenneth Jacobs; KKR co-CEO Henry Kravis; Carlyle Group CEO Kewsong Lee; Deutsche Bank Americas CEO Christiana Riley; Evercore Partners Co-CEO Ralph Schlosstein; Guggenheim Partners Executive Chairman Alan Schwartz; Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon; and Apollo Global Management Co-President James Zelter.\n\nAttempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they write, adding there should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power.\n\nLeading business lobbies in Washington joined the chorus.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue said, Efforts by some members of Congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.\n\nNational Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons said disappointment in the election outcome does not justify harming our democracy or undermining faith in our elections based on unproven charges and conspiracy theories… Now we ask Congress to join us in healing our nation, instead of fostering more division and vitriol.\n\nAnd the Business Roundtable, representing its roster of Fortune 200 CEOs, said it opposes efforts to delay or overturn the clear outcome of the election. With our country in the midst of a pandemic, business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs.\n\nYet in the last several weeks, donors from Wall Street and beyond have stepped up support for two Trump stalwarts in Georgia.\n\nBoth Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have proven loyal allies of the president. And the incumbents underlined the point this week as they defended the Trump's push to overturn Biden's victory in their state. Perdue reacted to the news Trump tried to bully Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) into reversing the election outcome by condemning as disgusting the taping and releasing of their Saturday conversation. And Loeffler on Monday declared she would join the dozen Republican senators who have pledged to oppose certifying Biden's electoral college win, repeating the pledge onstage with Trump at a rally in Dalton, Ga.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wave of publicly reported contributions predates those latest developments. But Loeffler and Perdue both have campaigned for months as lockstep Trump backers, including by refusing to acknowledge Biden's win. Wall Street donors nevertheless have been showering the pair with contributions because they are worried that a Democratic Senate would help President-elect Joe Biden push for tighter regulations on the financial industry, CNBC's Brian Schwartz reports, citing an unnamed GOP strategist with banking industry clients.\n\nThe roster of high-profile financiers cutting checks directly to one or both of the incumbents in recent weeks, per Schwartz and our own review of the candidates' most recent federal election filings, includes: hedge fund billionaire John Paulson; Fortress Investment Group CEO Randal Nardone; Arsenal Capital partner Stephen McLean; Silver Point Capital CEO Edward Mule; AQR Capital Management co-founder Clifford Asness; Owl Rock Capital co-founder Doug Ostrover; and Soroban Capital co-founder Eric Mandelblatt.\n\nThey join a handful of industry titans who have backed the Republicans on an entirely different scale by giving to the Senate Leadership Fund, the Mitch McConnell-affiliated super PAC. Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen Schwarzman gave that group $15 million on Nov. 12, the same day Citadel founder Ken Griffin forked over $10 million.\n\nAs Dawsey notes, Schwarzman didn't sign the CEO letter on Monday, but Jonathan Gray, the firm's president and chief operating officer, did.\n\nLoeffler and Perdue personify the challenge facing right-leaning business leaders uncomfortable with the party's trajectory.\n\nBoth appear willing to do whatever it takes to stay in Trump's good graces.

So you take a look at other countries, Pakistan is there, they should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting, the reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union.\n\nWell, where to begin? For starters, the syntax is so mangled one could be genuinely skeptical he was saying anything more than, Russia. Afghanistan. Give it to Putin.\n\nBeyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that Trump endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the United States and the Free World. (You'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist Communist dictatorship.) Former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:\n\nThis strikes me as a typical Trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of Afghanistan, says former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to prop up one faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) against another. Their invasion catalyzed the existing Islamist opposition to the PDPA but I digress. (In other words, Trump's claim Russia went into Afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) Edelman adds, Simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. If Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would Russian President Vladimir Putin go back in?\n\nI am glad Trump brought up the end of the Soviet Union, however. The U.S.S.R. didn't magically change its name; the West won the Cold War (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things Trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran.\n\nMore to the point, why is Trump handing off chunks of the world — Syria, Afghanistan, the Sea of Azov — to America's greatest international foe? (Some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) And where does this giveaway stop — at the Baltics? At Berlin? (It's stunning that hawks such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who'd melt down if President Barack Obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. His policy is not America First — as in America leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. Rather it is, Russia First as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. If Ronald Reagan's response when asked how the Cold War would end was, We win, they lose, Trump's is: Putin wins. Let's bury our heads in the sand.\n\nEliot A. Cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious Trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, The president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of U.S. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the United States has sustained for nearly eight decades. He explains, The real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the United States should accept a more modest role in world affairs.\n\nIn short, at a time when we should fortify alliances, enhance diplomacy, bolster foreign aid, draw clear distinctions between democracies and authoritarians, and expand trade, we are doing the opposite, which merely encourages the go-it-alone voices on the right and the we-can-do-no-good-anyway voices on the left.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe should be worried, as Cohen points out, that Trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for America. Perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among American leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of U.S. foreign policy. . . . Trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the United States is merely one great power among others. In this view, Washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of U.S. leaders so carefully built.\n\nThe result of Trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by China; a less dynamic American economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change. It's not a world any of us should want to live in.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD
In a nutshell, Robb argues that trade — rather than national security — dominates Trump's foreign policy thinking, inverting decades of U.S. practice. By implication, that makes any country running a large trade surplus with the United States a direct competitor.\n\nAD\n\nIf Robb is right, that's very bad news for China, but it doesn't make welcome reading for countries such as Mexico, Germany and Japan. Unless they can take steps to reduce their trade imbalances with the United States, they are unlikely to be fully trusted by a man who sees trade as a zero-sum game, and sees anyone beating the United States as a threat.\n\nAD\n\nFirst, here's the analysis, in Robb's own words:\n\nSince WW2, U.S. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. In fact, it's hard to imagine a U.S. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. This means that ALL other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. In particular, U.S. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the Cold War) even if these trade relationships damage U.S. economic performance.\n\nTrump inverts that policy relationship. In Trump's post-Cold War world, U.S. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. Even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. If trade policy is dominant, we'll see China, Mexico and the EU (Germany) become competitors. Russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? China runs by far the largest trade surplus with the United States, some $319 billion in 2016. That's nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. In fact, China bought just $104 billion in U.S. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the United States.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Trump took less than 10 seconds into the first presidential debate to slam China for devaluing its currency and stealing American jobs.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, has also taken issue with China over its island-building in the South China Sea, and he has publicly questioned American adherence to the one-China policy, the basis for diplomatic relations between the two countries that rules out independence for the island of Taiwan.\n\nAD\n\nBut the implication of the trade-first philosophy is that neither Taiwan nor the South China Sea really matters to Trump, except as ways to beat up on a country he sees as a direct economic threat.\n\nIndeed, he has suggested as much, telling Fox News last month that he didn't know why the United States had to be bound by the one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\n\nAD\n\nThe other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in U.S.-China relations is probably here to stay, as long as Trump sticks around in the White House.\n\nBeijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and Trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from Asia to the United States. But China's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.\n\nAD\n\nHere's Robb again:\n\nNational security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. For example, military tension with China creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the U.S. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). In a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the U.S. The U.S. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the U.S. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).\n\nOf course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. Indeed, China's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across Asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the United States. Yet Robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.\n\nAD\n\nThe second-largest U.S. trade deficit in 2016 was with Japan, at $62.4 billion. Japan largely got a pass from the United States when it used protectionism and state subsidies to build its industries after World War II: then, it was seen as a key strategic ally worth supporting despite running a large trade surplus with the United States.\n\nTrump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. Japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. He has also warned Toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in Mexico, and he argued that Japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing U.S. troops in Okinawa.\n\nAD\n\nThe same goes for South Korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. Trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the Obama administration.\n\nAD\n\nThird on the list comes Germany, with a trade surplus with the United States running at $59.6 billion in 2016. If trade is all that matters, perhaps, it should not have come as such a surprise to hear Trump strike right at Berlin's heart when called NATO obsolete and argued that U.S. partners are not paying what they are supposed to be paying.\n\nIndeed, he implicitly argues, why should the United States be bearing a disproportionate burden of the cost of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when, as he suggested in a recent interview, Germany is just another one of those countries being very unfair to the U.S.?\n\nAD\n\nTrump has also taken aim at German carmakers, asking why so many Americans drive a Mercedes-Benz when Germany buys so few Chevrolets, and criticizing BMW over plans to build a new plant in Mexico. His criticism may have been unjustified, as Bertel Schmidt argues in Forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of ruining the country with her immigration policy, and the two leaders clearly have a very different worldview. But perhaps trade is the real root of Trump's distrust of Germany.\n\nFourth on the list comes Mexico, which ran a trade surplus with the United States of $58.8 billion in 2016. Trump, of course, is already preparing to build that wall, and get the Mexicans to pay for it.\n\nOf course, this framework is only one way of looking at Trump's foreign policy priorities, and it doesn't explain his hawkish stance over Iran or concern over North Korea's nuclear program.
Children from Oyster Adams Elementary walk to their school. A new policy aims at giving parents more choices to enroll students in charter schools within walking distance of their homes. (Kate Patterson for The Washington Post) (Kate Patterson/For The Washington Post)\n\nThousands of D.C. children who live near public elementary charter schools could soon qualify for a new admission preference to help them enroll in those schools under a plan Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced Monday.\n\nUnder the city's current policy, students have a guaranteed seat in a traditional public school near their home. But those assigned neighborhood schools — all part of the D.C. Public Schools — are sometimes more than a half mile away. That can make it hard for elementary students to walk to school.\n\nIn those cases, Bowser said, families that live no more than a half mile from a charter school should get special consideration through the city's school lottery system. The mayor said she wants to make it easier for more of our students to enroll in charter schools that are within walking distance of their home.\n\nBowser's proposal for a walkability preference would target an estimated 10,000 students who live more than a half mile away from their assigned traditional school but less than a half mile from a charter school. Charter schools would not be required to offer an admission preference to those students, but they would be allowed to do so.\n\nThe policy, if approved by the D.C. Council, would take effect in the 2018-19 school year. It could have a significant effect on a public education marketplace that gives parents many options. About 29,000 students from pre-kindergarten through 5th grade were enrolled in D.C. Public Schools in 2015-16, compared to about 21,600 in charter elementary schools that year.\n\nBowser has pushed to increase school choice in the District. But some education advocates questioned Monday's proposal. They said it could drain students from traditional D.C. schools and make it harder for students from low-income families to get into top charter schools, which are often located outside of their neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2012, a 12-member D.C. task force considered whether to require all charter schools to offer a neighborhood preference, but the idea was rejected.\n\nCouncil member David Grosso (I-At Large), who chairs the Council's education committee, said he has some reservations about the proposal and has already heard some vocal uproar.\n\nThis is very complicated stuff that could perpetuate divisions within our city and communities, and it will have to be very thought through, Grosso said. I am not too inclined to support it, but I am open to having a conversation.\n\nUnder the lottery system, there are charter school enrollment preferences for children of founding board members and siblings of current students. Grosso said adding another preference would possibly deny students an equal opportunity to enroll in quality schools.\n\nIt is unknown how many of the District's 82 elementary charter schools support the measure. Scott Pearson, executive director of the D.C. Public Charter School Board, called the measure an interesting enrollment proposal that addresses real issues families face.\n\nHe added, All preferences have complex effects so we're speaking with school leaders and others to better understand their perspectives.\n\nEboni-Rose Thompson, the chair of the Ward 7 education council, said she fears the changes would mean less access to high-quality schools. In Ward 7, for example, there are no dual-language charter schools. Most of those schools are in Wards 1 and 4. Under the proposal, some students in Ward 1 might have greater access to those schools because they live near them. That would leave fewer seats available for students from Ward 7.\n\nWhen we accepted charters into the city, they were supposed to be city-wide schools. What happened to that? Thompson asked. Do we just throw that away because we are trying to get at a different problem?\n\nCaryn Ernst, a parent activist, sits on a mayoral task force that aims to increase collaboration between charters and the school system. Ernst said she was surprised to learn about Bowser's proposal. The task force last fall considered and rejected a similar idea, according to Ernst.\n\nThe idea that she would announce this is astonishing to me and it completely undermines the purpose of a task force, Ernst said.\n\nBowser also proposed raising annual facilities funding for charter schools, to $3,193 per pupil. That would be 2.2 percent more than the current level of $3,124 per pupil.\n\nBowser announced her proposals at D.C. Bilingual Public Charter School in Northeast Washington, along Pearson and Deputy Mayor for Education Jennifer C. Niles. John Davis, the interim chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, was not present.\n\nAntwan Wilson, the incoming chancellor of DCPS, starts his new job Wednesday.\n\nMichelle Lerner, the spokeswoman for DCPS, said the school system looks forward to working with the city on the lottery changes so that all families can access high-quality schools.
According to standard conceptions of democracy — which focus on violations of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly and the press — Hungary's status as an autocracy is ambiguous. The two most widely used indexes of democracy — conducted by Freedom House and Polity — continue to code Hungary as democratic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClearly, Hungary is not a democracy. But understanding why requires a nuanced understanding of the line between democracy and autocracy.\n\nDemocracy requires a level playing field\n\nIn our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. Leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. These autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.\n\nIn any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. But an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. Let's look at how that works.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirst, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. Governing parties may also create a biased news media. In Malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.\n\nGoverning parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. The most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win. A country is not a democracy when gerrymandering makes it all but impossible for the opposition to win national power.\n\nFinally, ruling parties may pack judiciaries, electoral commissions and other nominally independent bodies to ensure that the incumbent will win critical electoral, legal or other disputes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAuthoritarianism, Hungarian style\n\nOrban's Hungary is a prime example of a competitive autocracy with an uneven playing field. In 2010, Orban's Fidesz party won 53 percent of the vote and 68 percent of parliamentary seats. Since then, the party has increasingly denied opposition access to resources necessary to compete for power.\n\nFirst, Fidesz infiltrated much of the state bureaucracy. By 2012, Fidesz loyalists were already entrenched in every corner of the state, as Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele documented — including in the constitutional court, budget council, electoral commission, national judicial office, state audit office, public prosecutor's office and national bank. That brings significant advantages. For example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, Fidesz has changed the electoral rules in ways that make it easier for the party to dominate. That includes significant gerrymandering — splitting off constituencies with a leftist majority to dilute the opposition vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with Orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power. But the uneven playing field creates a daunting obstacle to opposition victory at the ballot box.\n\nThe advantages of an uneven playing field\n\nKilling a journalist or firing on crowds of protesters can easily rally international opinion and turn an autocrat into a pariah. But few notice or care if party supporters infiltrate the electoral commission or a pro-government entrepreneur uses government funds to take control over an opposition website. And using the legal system to force out independent voices enables the government to argue that it has not abused power. For example, after forcing a leading independent university out of Hungary, the government argued that this was the result of a perfectly reasonable requirement under Hungary's legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFidesz's ambiguous tactics have succeeded. Most importantly, the European Union has, with a few exceptions, failed to confront Orban's government about its democratic backsliding. As long as Orban is able to maintain such ambiguity, he is unlikely to face serious consequences for his country's democratic failures.\n\nLucan Ahmad Way is a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\nSteven Levitsky is a professor of government at Harvard University.
She continued in her role as editor in chief of the Texas Tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. In March last year, she sat down with Amanda Zamora, the Tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit ProPublica, and presented her idea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou could tell she was completely taken with this idea of a site that looked at the impact of politics and policy on women, Zamora said. Once she is set on something, you have no doubt that she's going to make it happen, and I knew it was something I wanted to participate in.\n\nThe two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.\n\nOn Monday, Ramshaw and Zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and Kathryn Murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.\n\nThis isn't the day's news but pink. This is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said Ramshaw, who is CEO of the nonprofit. We are not doing turn-of-the-screw reporting, but rather what that turn of the screw means for different parts of the women's electorate.\n\nThe name derives from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. Given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the American media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, Ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 19th Amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said Zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. The 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.\n\nThe organization is launching with a single reporter in the field, Errin Haines, who previously covered race and ethnicity for the Associated Press. She will cover the 2020 race. A bare-bones site is launching Monday. Until 19thnews.org is fully built later this year, the 19th's articles will publish on The Washington Post's website.\n\nNewmark was among the first donors and made a $500,000 gift. We need a news outlet about gender politics that does a lot of fact-checking with absolutely no mansplaining, he said in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKathryn Murdoch, the wife of Rupert Murdoch's younger son, James, pledged $1 million to the venture. Convinced by polling showing women had vastly different views from men on issues such as climate change and Trump, Murdoch saw the relevance of Ramshaw's idea.\n\nYou need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and I look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting Band-Aids on them after they develop, Murdoch said.\n\nWhen asked how the 19th was different from the news outlets her family owns, which include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, she simply said the 19th and the foundation she and her husband operate are reflective of her values.\n\nAD\n\nShe and her husband were recently critical of the way Murdoch media properties have covered the Australian wildfires. In an interview with The Post, she shied away from commenting about Fox News or other Murdoch outlets. This is what I do, and I'm happy to be taken to task on any of it, but that is all I control.\n\nAD\n\nA few years ago I might have said, 'No, no [to Ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  Murdoch said. But the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: It was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.\n\nRamshaw is not accepting anonymous donations to the site and will maintain a list of funders on the site in an effort to be as transparent as possible about who is supporting the journalism at the 19th.\n\nAD\n\nOn launch day, the organization, which has hired an editor in chief, will post 17 jobs; nine in the newsroom including beats covering women in Congress, in the economy, statehouses and several others. They are hiring to fill positions to cover specific demographics that make up the female electorate, including black and Latina women. The site will have no opinion or editorial section.\n\nAnd the publication is not averse to hiring men — its CFO is male.
You shouldn't be enduring this, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said during a conference call Friday with federal union leaders and members. This is truly a shutdown [that] makes no sense whatsoever. Government should be open, should never have closed.\n\nAD\n\nHearing from rank-and-file feds might give Trump a better idea of the difficulties they are facing and a more realistic sense of their views on being locked out of their jobs and required to work with no guarantee of pay. Payday this Friday is in grave danger of disappearing.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who suggested the shutdown could last for months or even years, displayed woeful ignorance of the plight of federal workers at a news conference Friday, when he said they would encourage him to keep going with the shutdown, because a border wall is far more important than a fully operational government. He apparently got that impression from Border Patrol officers he met with Thursday. These officers, federal workforce outliers, endorsed his wall, just as they did his candidacy, even though they are also victims of his shutdown.\n\nIt comes down to border security. … We are extremely grateful to President Trump, and we fully support what he is doing to take care of our nation's borders, Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, said during a Thursday news conference with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nTalk with federal employees and you'll quickly learn that sentiment doesn't reflect the views of many, including those in the council's parent union, the American Federation of Government Employees. During the conference call Friday, AFGE's policy director Jacqueline Simon made it clear that the council's stance does not reflect that of the union.\n\nAD\n\nNo matter what some of our members may think of Mr. Trump's agenda on immigration and border security, we know that all of them, they need their paychecks and they can't go to the grocery store, pay their rent or their child-care expenses with their love of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, Simon said. We know our members and every single agency affected by the shutdown are terrified that when the day comes that there's no paycheck on payday.\n\nIf Trump talked to more federal employees, he would hear stories from people like Katherine Scheflen, a lawyer in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. She needs her check on time. I am a single mother of two disabled children. I live paycheck to paycheck, as do many Americans, she said. It is not complicated — if I miss a paycheck, I cannot pay my mortgage and my other bills. It is as simple as that.\n\nAD\n\nCongress will probably provide backpay for furloughed federal employees such as Scheflen. But the likelihood of money in the future doesn't pay bills due today. Backpay for low-wage contractors, like those who serve lunch in federal cafeterias, is less likely.\n\nAD\n\nI live pay check to pay check like nearly all of my coworkers, and I'm scared that with losing weeks of income and my healthcare benefits, one family medical emergency for myself, my children, or my grandchildren during Donald Trump's shut down could make us homeless, said Lisa Earle in a statement provided by Unite Here, which represents the Smithsonian worker. It's not fair that politicians playing games put me out of work, and it's even worse that my coworkers and I may never get back pay for the shutdown when we're just as impacted as all other federal workers.\n\nIt's ludicrous that Americans are denied federal services and workers like Scheflen and Earle suffer because Trump and Democrats differ over $4 billion for the border wall in a $4 trillion budget. Trump bogusly and repeatedly promised during his 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for his unpopular wall proposal.\n\nAD\n\nYet, while there is certainly an argument to be made for Democrats to meet Trump's hostage demands, make no mistake, this is Trump's shutdown, and increasingly that of congressional Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nTrump's intransigence demonstrates the hollowness of the Republican position. He rejects, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to consider, appropriation measures the Senate approved last month that would end the shutdown. The House voted for the legislation after Democrats took control last week, but McConnell won't call for a necessary vote in the Senate.\n\nThe legislation would fund agencies indirectly related to border security. The Department of Homeland Security would receive temporary funding, providing a month for the discussions to continue.\n\nAD\n\nIt should be a no-brainer. McConnell called the House approval a time-wasting act of political posturing, even though the House followed the lead of his Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nWe're just going to have to work very hard, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on the call with Cardin, to increase the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold that vote.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican voters will increase that pressure as government services continue to deteriorate.
The Georgia elections, if they go the way of Democrats, would expand the ranks of senators backing a public option.\n\nDemocrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are seeking to unseat Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, and give their party 50 seats in the Senate, making Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris the tie-breaking vote. Polls in Georgia close at 7 p.m., concluding a race that has seen record-breaking spending for a nonpresidential election.\n\nGeorgia's two Republican Senate candidates careened over the weekend toward a rocky end to their high-stakes dual runoff races, trying hard to avoid becoming collateral damage in a series of raging disputes that have embroiled the GOP, our colleague Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth Ossoff and Warnock have said they want to expand health insurance incrementally through broadening the Affordable Care Act and creating a government-backed public option plan for Americans, rather than overhauling the whole system with Medicare-for-all or something like it.\n\nThis is the approach advocated by Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Democrats. Yet the Republicans spent the last two months pummeling Ossoff and Warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as Medicare-for-all proponents.\n\nThe Republican talking points are the things we heard in the general elections, [that the Democrats are] radical socialists who want a government-run health-care system, said Ken Thorpe, professor of health policy at Emory University. On almost every ad it's either directly talked about or implied.\n\nYet even incremental health coverage expansion won't necessarily be possible in the Senate, even if Ossoff and Warnock win.\n\nWith 50 seats and a tie-breaking vote from Harris, Senate Democrats would have to get every single one of their members in line — or nab the help of some Republicans to pass legislation. And unless there's a budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass, they'd need 60 votes to get around any filibusters.\n\nAny significant health-care legislation will likely originate in the Democrat-run House.\n\nAnd now House Democrats have tweaked rules around paying for legislation, potentially making it easier for their members to pass bills if they can be reasonably seen as related to the coronavirus pandemic or climate change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNormally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. This requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.\n\nBut House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) advanced two major exceptions, which the House approved yesterday. Legislation to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic or public health consequences of the coronavirus pandemic or climate change will be exempted from the pay-as-you-go rules.\n\nThis could make it easier for the lower chamber to pass bills related to the coronavirus pandemic and send them over to the Senate, putting pressure on that body to approve them.\n\nAD\n\nThe move will likely spur House Democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand Medicare and Medicaid during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nThis is a rules package that encourages us to tackle the most pressing issues facing our nation today, McGovern said in a floor speech Monday. It makes reforms to our budget rules so we can deal with these dual challenges through an all-hands-on-deck approach while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n\nAhh, oof and ouch\n\nAHH: U.S. health officials are rejecting suggestions to defer the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIn recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimens that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.\n\nAD\n\nThe United Kingdom has already announced it will prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose of an authorized vaccine, even if it means delaying the booster shot. Limited data suggests the first vaccine dose may offer partial protection, and some prominent public health officials argue it's worth taking the risk to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nAD\n\nBut top government health officials dismiss the suggestion. Leading infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui have all recently roundly rejected proposals to alter the timeline of the two-dose vaccine regimen.\n\nThere really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. Fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.\n\nSo far, the United States has only administered a small fraction of the vaccine doses that have been distributed to states, according to a Washington Post tracker, which looks at vaccine priorities and administration state by state.\n\nVaccine administration rates vary across states. While Georgia has vaccinated 0.7 percent of its population, South Dakota has vaccinated 3 percent of its population.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost states have adopted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. But states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.\n\nOOF: England is entering a new national lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak driven by a new, more contagious virus variant.\n\n\n\nWith most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday. In England, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe shutdown is the country's third after lockdowns initiated in March and November, The Post's Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Ben Guarino report. Johnson said the new variant of the virus, which has so far spread to at least 30 countries, is thought to be 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a new national lockdown in England on Jan. 4 to try to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. (Reuters)\n\nNew York confirmed its first case of the new U.K. strain on Monday. The case was identified in a 60-year-old man who had no recent travel history and comes after cases have also been identified in California, Florida and Colorado.\n\nSouth Africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. Britain's health minister Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the UK new variant. The South Africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of Britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.\n\nOUCH: Young ER doctors who risked their lives in the pandemic are struggling to find jobs.\n\nYoung doctors, called residents, who specialize in emergency medicine are struggling to find full-time employment even while working on the front lines of the covid-19 response. The doctors, many of whom are saddled with debt from medical school, find themselves in a predicament that would have been unimaginable for them a year earlier, The Post's Ben Guarino reports.\n\nThe dearth of jobs is the result of a domino effect: Many people stayed away from hospital emergency rooms this past year, wary of contracting the virus. As patient numbers dropped, emergency departments brought in less money. As a result, cash-strapped employers stopped recruiting new doctors, Ben writes.\n\nSome residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls. A survey from the American College of Emergency Physicians found that 20 percent of emergency medicine practices laid off doctors this year. It's a strange paradox in the midst of a pandemic when it seems like emergency medicine doctors should be in high demand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're putting our own lives at risk, our family's lives at risk, emergency medicine physician R.J. Sontag, the president of the Emergency Medicine Residents' Association, told The Post. We're in, frankly, a financially precarious position with a ton of debt and limited income. And the fact of the matter is that employers just aren't hiring.\n\nMore in coronavirus\n\n\n\nA Florida state representative is calling for Mar-a-Lago to be shut down after President Trump's private club held a New Year's Eve bash in which attendees did not wear masks in violation of a Palm Beach County mask order, The Post's Lori Rozsa reports . Palm Beach County officials said they were reviewing the complaint from state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat from nearby Lake Worth Beach.\n\n\n\nA Wisconsin pharmacist tried to spoil 500 doses of a coronavirus vaccine because he believed they were unsafe, according to Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol, The Post's Hannah Knowles reports . The employee of Aurora Health Care removed Moderna vaccine vials from refrigeration, seeking to sabotage the supplies, but charges are still up in the air as investigators seek to determine whether the removal of the doses hurt their viability. At least 57 people received doses that were taken out of refrigeration.\n\nIt's been a year since the first rumblings of a coronavirus outbreak in China. On Jan. 4, 2020, the World Health Organization tweeted that it was investigating a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The following day the U.S. agency said that China reported its first cases to the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019, and that at least 44 cases had been reported, The Post's Siobhán O'Grady reports\n\nBecause vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. This happened, for instance, at a Giant Foods store in Northeast Washington, D.C., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, The Post's Lola Fadulu reports . The decision was in line with guidance from the D.C. Department of Health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.\n\nElsewhere in health care\n\nA high-profile venture that promised to disrupt health care is disbanding.\n\nHaven, created two years ago by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website Monday that it will shutter, The Post's Jay Greene reports.\n\nAD\n\nThe venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy, Berkshire's Warren Buffett said in a statement at the time. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\n\nBut the initiative is ending with little to show for its efforts, as health-care costs continued to grow in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. A spokesperson for Haven said that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase would continue to leverage insights gained from the joint-venture. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).\n\nChildren's hospitals may be partially to blame to for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA growing body of research shows that overuse and misuse of antibiotics in children's hospitals — which health experts and patients say should know better — helps fuel these dangerous bacteria that attack adults and, increasingly, children. Doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, Kaiser Health News's Laura Ungar reports.\n\nAD\n\nA study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in U.S. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. The study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.\n\nResearchers say that the overprescription of antibiotics is fueling drug resistant strains of dangerous bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
But it's now far from clear when — or even if — the panic-inducing drawdown will take place. Trump seemed chastened by the backlash in Washington and extended his initial 30-day deadline for the pullout to four months. Administration officials have since muddied the waters further, briefing reporters that there is no timeline for withdrawal whatsoever.\n\nWe're pulling out of Syria, Trump said Sunday, before offering a significant caveat. But ... we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the chaos is a clear split within the White House. Trump, who espouses a kind of nationalist isolationism, is keen on disentangling the United States from costly military adventures that offer him minimal political returns at home.\n\nUnlike many Republican wonks in Washington, Trump was never interested in removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. In December, he perfunctorily declared that the Islamic State had been defeated — despite mountains of evidence to the contrary — and said it was largely the responsibility of Turkey and other Arab countries to carry on the fight.\n\nNational security advisor John Bolton said on Jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that Turkey will not target Kurdish forces. (Reuters)\n\nLeading hawks in Washington, including key figures within the administration, see things much differently. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and Trump's special envoy to Syria, former diplomat James Jeffrey, all argue that U.S. military involvement in Syria is aimed not just at defeating Islamist militants but also at countering Iranian influence in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA U.S. official told The Washington Post that Trump never personally endorsed this strategy, and the president has publicly hinted as much. During a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump offhandedly remarked that Iran's leadership can do what they want in Syria.\n\nThe top brass in the Pentagon, meanwhile, is hardly convinced that the Islamic State has been defeated. Military officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and Turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it considers part of a Kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the Islamic State, my colleagues reported.\n\nThis week, senior administration officials are jetting around the Middle East in a bid to assuage allies that the White House is still committed to their security interests. But so far, they're mostly betraying the discord within the administration over what comes next.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo, a vocal advocate of the anti-Iran strategy, will make an eight-country swing through all six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman — as well as Egypt and Jordan. He will try to present a united front despite the White House's increasingly incoherent approach to the region.\n\nThe counter-Iran campaign continues, Pompeo told right-wing outlet Newsmax on Thursday. We'll do all of those things. … We will simply do it at a time when the American forces have departed Syria.\n\nBolton, meanwhile, was in Israel over the weekend and will later head to Turkey, where he'll be accompanied by Jeffrey — the Syria envoy — and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seemingly contradicting Trump, Bolton told reporters that no withdrawal from Syria will take place until the Islamist militants are fully defeated and Turkey guarantees the safety of Syrian Kurdish units allied with the United States but considered terrorist enemies by Ankara.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton said. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThe facts on the ground suggest the timetable will be rather open-ended. The diplomatic wrangling with Turkey — which has vowed a military operation against Kurdish units across its southern border — may prove to be deeply complicated. A security guarantee for the Syrian Kurds could just be a new unobtainable condition, tweeted Faysal Itani of the Atlantic Council. Seeing their options dwindling, the main Syrian Kurdish armed faction has opened talks with the Assad regime, requesting military support from Damascus against a potential Turkish offensive.\n\nHawks in the Washington establishment have cheered Trump's apparent about-face. I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), telling CBS's Face the Nation that the bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the president for reevaluating what he's doing. ... He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut others see the latest changes as more evidence of an administration conflicted and confused about its agenda overseas. Bolton got way out ahead of the policy, and it's his job to understand what the president wants, Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador in Syria, said to my colleagues. When the president is nervous or cautious about something, it's the NSC's job to relay that back to State and the Pentagon, and warn them not to go too far. Apparently they didn't get the message.
In normal times, restaurant and bar writers look for the new and different: breaking trends, hot chefs or bars that offer a vibe their neighbors don't. This inherent tendency to seek what's fresh and exciting is, I think, why businesses are so often praised and admired for pivoting to new models during the pandemic, when whiplash changes to menus and physical spaces are often born less of creative innovation than desperately trying to find a way for the business to stay afloat. For some, it was building a beer garden in the parking lot; for others, it was tossing out their critically acclaimed menus to make sandwiches and simpler fare.\n\nBut despite the chaos, there were some innovations that made the lives of staff and customers easier, or even better. The District changed alcohol laws to allow bars to sell cocktails and six-packs for carryout and delivery, providing a source of income when indoor spaces were closed to the public. The idea proved so popular that the regulations became permanent in October. No one can predict exactly when we'll get back to normal, but whenever that happens, I hope these other changes stick around.\n\nLet us drink (and dine) in closed streets and parking spaces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarly in the pandemic, cities across the country began closing streets to traffic to provide more room for socially distanced running and biking. And by summer, as restaurants took their first steps toward reopening, they began to stake their own claims to the streets, moving tables into pedestrianized roads. The result was charming, comfortable and provided a sense of quasi-normalcy after spring's stay-at-home orders.\n\nThis wasn't a radical new idea: Annapolis closes busy West Street for a weekly street festival each summer, and Old Town Alexandria voted in 2019 to close a stretch of King Street on weekends between April and October. But the dire situation facing restaurants and bars forced local jurisdictions to reconsider their priorities: Diners enjoying a meal, a beer garden and entertainment outdoors were judged more important than drivers going a few blocks out of their way. With restaurants staring into a financial abyss, these models should continue for the foreseeable future. Make outdoor dining the destination, whether that's tables with waterfront views in Annapolis's historic downtown, or Bethesda's food court-style tables, which let visitors choose from any nearby restaurant — perfect for the group who can't decide on one cuisine.\n\nD.C., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of Dupont Circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of Eighth Street NW in Penn Quarter. (The closure of 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) Where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. It was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. Even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.\n\nReplace tips with mandatory 20 percent service charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTipping is a difficult topic. It's a vestige of Reconstruction-era discrimination that, according to study after study, perpetuates racism, sexism and ageism in dining rooms. But restaurant owners are loath to raise menu prices to the point where tipping isn't necessary to pay staff a real wage, because customers have become used to low, tip-subsidized prices. Some customers seem to really enjoy the feeling of power they have over restaurant and bar workers, mentally dinging percentage points off a tip if the steak isn't medium-rare or the wine glasses aren't topped up every time.\n\nBut when servers who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing both a decline in tips and a rise in sexual harassment, should we really be leaving an employee's rent money in the hands of people who ask servers to remove their masks before deciding to add or subtract a few bucks? Of course not.\n\nTo guarantee a decent wage, a number of places I've visited in the past year, from fancy restaurants to casual cocktail spots to rooftop beer gardens, have levied mandatory service charges of around 20 percent. They offer the chance to leave more, but not less, preventing customers from stiffing a server over a perceived slight. It's a great start — we should all be adding 20 percent anyway, right? — while the industry and governments come to grips with the mechanics and failures of tipping. Gratitude is a buzzword this year. Let's start with restaurant employees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLet us keep making reservations.\n\nI am not much for planning, partially because I don't want to tie myself down to being at a specific place at a set time weeks from now. (Maybe that's an issue for a professional to address.) I am also a traditionalist who is opposed to reserved seating in bar areas, as well as at beer gardens and breweries. Or at least I was.\n\nWith bar patios operating at a fraction of their capacity, an increasing number of establishments began to offer the ability to make reservations. In addition to higher-end destinations, I've made them for low-key neighborhood spots, like All Souls and Trusty's, where I've always just been happy to take my chances walking in and standing around until a seat opened up. And you know what? Having a guaranteed seat has been a godsend.\n\nAD\n\nDuring weekend visits to Archipelago or Cotton and Reed — two places where I had never made a reservation in my life — I repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. In the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. In fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. Visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: Attempts to visit Wunder Garten or Dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.\n\nAD\n\nSome big outdoor spaces, such as the Midlands Beer Garden and Biergarten Haus, take reservations while leaving most space available for walk-ins — consider a booking an insurance policy — and I'd even think twice about making the trip out to some of the region's bigger farm breweries, including Wheatland Spring and Waredaca, if I hadn't reserved a table in advance. Will we return to a more laissez faire system of bar crawls in the future? Maybe. In the meantime, I'm going to stick to my calendar.\n\nContactless ordering and payment should stay an option — at some places.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. After all, it's not just, If I eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, If I eat at this restaurant, could I make my server sick? As a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. I have to admit, I kind of liked it.\n\nAD\n\nFarewell to the little dance where a server brings you water and disappears; comes back to take your drink order and disappears; returns with cocktails, recites the specials and disappears while you decide on what to have for dinner. The pace of the evening is now in your hands. Know what you want to drink? Order as soon as you sit down, and you can sip while deciding what to snack on. Anyone who's needed to make a quick exit because of a cranky child (or cranky adult who's had one too many), appreciates the ability to settle the bill instantly and quietly.\n\nThat said, there are bars where I want to engage the staff about new beers and cocktails on the menu, or solicit opinions about the best wine to complement an entree. Contactless ordering has the effect of turning professional servers into glorified food runners. But for large, busy spaces, such as beer gardens or slammed happy hour spots, tech might offer a better way forward.\n\nAD\n\nBreweries and distilleries: Please keep leaving booze on my doorstep.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. breweries and distilleries have always had the legal ability to deliver their products directly to consumers. Virginia and Maryland producers had a few more hoops to jump through, but could also deliver or ship beer. But it wasn't until the pandemic shut bars and tasting rooms, denying them much needed revenue, that most began to look into it.\n\nIt soon became a lifeline, with some brewery owners delivering cases by hand, and Rockville's True Respite setting up the popular biermi online order and delivery service, which they shared with breweries across the region. As shelves in supermarkets and liquor stores have become more crowded, delivery has become a new niche where breweries can stand out — look at 3 Stars and its monthly CSB delivery program, which puts unreleased, ultra-fresh beers in the hands of members before the general public. But more importantly, this is a way for breweries to use a perceived convenience as a way to introduce themselves to new audiences.\n\nI'd rather pay for rounds than run up a tab.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the United Kingdom, I've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. For those unfamiliar with the concept: You order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. When glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. Repeat. No waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me. (Dealing with people who duck out on rounds is a discussion for another time.)\n\nBartenders in the United States, though, tend to dislike the concept, because time is money, and they could be pouring beers or whipping up drinks instead of stopping to take cash or run credit cards from the same group multiple times throughout the night. It's more economical to just wait until everyone is leaving.
