He's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now.

You know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. We should be preparing, and I'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that I'm a co-sponsor of to fund the Coast Guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. Hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. Hopefully, Mitch McConnell will bring it up on the floor of the Senate. I don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because Democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. And of course, Nancy Pelosi was very clear in the White House yesterday that when President Trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? You know, will I get my barrier funding? And she said no. And so again, the Democrats are being hypocritical. They're paying lip service to border security. Barriers actually work.

I think we'd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. You know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don't fund it.

I mean, they're going to take it up to the 9th Circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won't get the barrier. So I want the barrier. I want a secure border. And I think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the President was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. You know, I'm all for doing that. I'm happy to hang with him. There will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. I mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. There's no doubt about it. So let's address that specifically. Don't completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with Plan B as Democrats, as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer continue to dig in, let's give them basically an offer that they simply can't refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.", "label": 0}

The administration hasn't been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is.

The Obama administration responded to it. The CBP was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. About 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. Last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. In the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. You know, we have the Flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. And once they get here, they are home free. And when I hear Democrats talk about technology on the border, I mean, that's fine. We can track somebody, we can apprehend them. We process them. And then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them.

If you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service — led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill — is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris's post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely.

And in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million Syrians and Iraqis. It was committing genocide against Christians and Yazidis and minority groups. It was planning attacks against us in the homeland. It was carrying them out in Paris, that killed Americans in Brussels and Paris. We've come a long way. We have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS. What that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. And what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. So as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in Syria for some time. And on instructions from the White House, we were telling them, we'd stay in Syria until we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS, not just the physical territory. We'd stay in Syria until the Iranians left Syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in Geneva to end the ultimate civil war. We had told that to our partners on the ground.", "label": 1}

You know the president has said, I think he's right, you never- you never telegraph a punch when you're in a military campaign. You also don't telegraph your retreat. I've probably traveled to Syria more than any other American civilian official. I know our people in Syria. I- my heart is broken and we're all- our thoughts are with the families and loved ones that were just killed. In this campaign in Syria since 2015, we've had two Americans killed in action. We built this campaign plan, to answer for those who believe that we should not be over invested in these confl- conflicts. Americans are not fighting. We built a force of 60,000 Syrians to do the fighting. American taxpayers are not spending money on civilian stabilization or reconstruction costs. The coalition is doing that. So it was a sustainable campaign plan and we had in- the pieces in place, as we defeat the physical caliphate, to begin a very serious negotiation with some pretty hostile actors in Syria, including Russia.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "MCGURK: Well the minute you say- the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations. And we have to work things out in Syria with Russia, and our presence on the ground matters. And the two to three thousand Americans we have on the ground are not just any American soldiers. They are our most elite, most highly trained forces. Again I visited them from the beginning of the campaign- I was one of the first civilians on the ground way back in the battle of Kobanî. They have done an incredible job. It is those forces that allow the force of the Syrian Democratic Forces with 60,000 Syrians that we have helped build and enable, they allow that force to be effective. If you simply pull out American forces without a plan for what comes next, it is going to open up a signif- significant vacuum. I know the vice- vice president said we're gonna look for coalition partners to take our place. As the former leader of the coalition, I just don't think that that is credible. I know what it takes in these coalition capitals for them to put their blood and treasure on the line with us. It takes American leadership and takes American presence. And we've just told the world that we're no longer going to be present. So it'll have a dramatic ramification.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And that's why, what I wrote in the Washington Post, I think we have to really accept some hard truths. I think number one we are leaving. The president has made that clear- we are leaving. And that means our force should be really with one mission: to get out and get out safely. We cannot add additional missions onto our force while they are trying to withdraw under pressure, because withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "BRETT MCGURK: Announcing you're going to withdraw, and without a plan, and believe me there's no plan for what's coming next. Right now we do not have a plan. It increases a vulnerability of our force. It increases the environment on the ground in Syria. This environment in northeast Syria has been fairly permissive and safe. Again, I've been there almost 20 times and we have been- been very careful with this. It is increasing the risk to our people on the ground in Syria and will open up space for ISIS. But what's most important is we cannot expect a partner such as Turkey to come in and take our place, or another coalition partner to take our place. That is not realistic. And if our forces are under order to withdraw, as at the same time they are trying to find some formula for another coalition partner to come in, that is not workable. That is not a viable plan.", "label": 1}

That was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. In the view of the briefers, there was plotting. There was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. And so when you hear the President out there on Fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the Secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. When Secretary Pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking Soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging.

What we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions.

In terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts.

I-- I think that-- that I know very well what Joe's position was because I answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04.

Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes.

He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start.

He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously.

We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob.

We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now?

And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place.

{"sentence": "DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.", "label": 1}

Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up.

I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--", "label": 1}

President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency.

Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.", "label": 1}

We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.", "label": 1}

I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it.

They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept.

{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the IRS to put in place, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

{"sentence": "Currently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. Bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. He calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under President Barack Obama.

That's still less than Sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Roughly 11,000 Americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the Social Security Administration.

{"sentence": "How much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Based on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "Sanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. Tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. For instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay the wealth tax: The Sanders wealth tax would likely affect more Americans than those who would pay Bloomberg's surcharge. The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That's about 40,000 more households than Bloomberg's wealth tax.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under Warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How it would work: Warren's plan, like Sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. But her blueprint is simpler.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay: The Warren campaign, as well as economists Saez and Zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. But another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay Warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money Warren says it could.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How their plans would work: Neither Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg nor Amy Klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. Of the three, only Klobuchar has said she is open to one. Buttigieg called Warren's wealth tax extreme.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "In fact, Biden and Buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like Bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. Klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Instead, and like Bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages.

{"sentence": "How many people would pay more tax: The Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all Americans, not just the super wealthy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As of 2017, some 1.4 million American households had annual income of more than $500,000. Nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much government revenue they would raise: Penn Wharton has said Biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade.

{"sentence": "How seriously should such threats be taken? In many respects, much of this is not a surprise; North Korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities. The difficulty, of course, has always been separating rhetoric and reality with a nation from which it is notoriously difficult to secure concrete information.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "The North Korean government operates more than 130 restaurants in a dozen countries to earn hard currency that is sent back to Pyongyang. In addition, government officials also confirmed the defections of two North Korea diplomats. One reportedly worked on economic matters in the embassy of an African country and defected in May 2015 with his family, while another diplomat was reported to have defected from an Asian nation in February.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Most interesting, though, was the revelation on Monday that a high-level military officer who held the rank of colonel defected in 2015. The South Korea Defense Ministry offered few details, but confirmed that he was from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB, which was created in 2009 with the merger of several military and party organizations.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The organization reports directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and is responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage, along with the recent addition of cyberoperations under Bureau 121. Bureau 121 has itself been responsible for hack attacks on several South Korean media outlets, government institutions and banks, and is believed by U.S. officials to have been behind the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "It is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the North Korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. Access to a high-level military official familiar with the North Korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. In short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for Pyongyang.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. The public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the North (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The South Korean government has made the case that these defections are a sign that the economic sanctions imposed in the wake of North Korean weapons testing are working, and that people are voting with their feet.

{"sentence": "Adding an additional layer of intrigue is a report by the progressive Hankyoreh newspaper, which reported that the Unification Ministry did not want to release information on the defectors, but was forced to do so by the Park Geun-hye administration. The government has for its part denied there were political motives in announcing the defections, maintaining the high-level nature of these examples and their links to U.N. sanctions and elite discontent were important to reveal.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Still, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. The colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of North Korea's leadership. Moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in North Korea. Could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The North Korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the U.S. and regional allies like South Korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully.

With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "We hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Of course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. Room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "When we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. According to research by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of U.S. colleges.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Now IHEP defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Given that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. It's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Though you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. As long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Then there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Imagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. With a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "On the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Here's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Now one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. It's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a Roth IRA, if you're eligible to open one.

With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends).

{"sentence": "How did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "If Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "President Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Recently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. After the laughter died down, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama an upside-down Pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Our Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Men like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "And they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "In the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. They held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. Even Lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the Civil War were grounded in the Constitution and the rule of law.", "label": 3}

He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers.

{"sentence": "Borrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. When they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. If the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger.

{"sentence": "Intuitively, it would appear that the sooner you pay down the balance and rid yourself of the PMI premium, the better off you will be, but this may or may not be the case. It depends on the circumstances and preferences of the borrower.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Consider the example given earlier where after three years the borrower earns 8.55% on an investment of $11,098. If the same borrower decided to make the investment after 4 years instead of 3, her dollar savings would be smaller because both the number of PMI premium payments and the balance reduction in the payoff month would be smaller. On the other hand, the required investment would be $7326 instead of $11,098, which might make it affordable, and the rate of return on investment would be 10.52% as compared to 8.55%.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In general, the longer the borrower waits to pay down the balance to the point where the PMI is eliminated, the smaller is the savings in dollars and in the investment required, but the higher is the rate of return on investment. The power of the spreadsheet is that it allows each individual borrower to adopt the payoff strategy that best fits her needs and capacities.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In comparison to other investments, an investment in PMI payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. The drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is.

{"sentence": "If my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on TV, here's where I ― the Black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. I would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that I wanted so badly to be white in the first place. Post-Bushroot, I would have taken a hard look at all the other times I had experienced both covert and overt racism. I would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which I was the butt at Syracuse.

I felt grateful that at this point in my life, I was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. I began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream.

However, I take far less issue with that ― I made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than I do with my attitude along the way. I was in full-on racial denial.

{"sentence": "At first, while I was still hurting inside, I felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as I could from the position of being a victim of racism. I would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, Suck it, Syracuse! As I became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. I am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka Type A), so I began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were.

Their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. But now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party.

That would mean getting 10 Republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "There are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority.

{"sentence": "Even with Republicans out of legislative power, Biden faces a potential crisis in the Supreme Court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The Republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that Congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. Biden and a Democratic Congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the ACA and rendering the lawsuit moot.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Protecting the ACA is but a preliminary step. Biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like HealthCare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. Biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA.

We reached women across the country, including a majority of women who never ever marched or organized a day in their lives, and we were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another.

Law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. And I've experienced that. I've been arrested over 20 times on Capitol Hill grounds, inside the Capitol and outside the Capitol.

We've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. I believe that the Women's March ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the Women's March ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. We cannot defeat Donald Trump or his policies in silos. Once Donald Trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. So I think in the next four years, under the Biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.", "label": 4}

That, for me, is a reflection of what is possible over the next four years ― to push this administration to do the right thing.

That was a big campaign that came out of our movement.", "label": 4}

Based a range of published or leaked nuclear war plans and statements by political leaders, there are two key types of nuclear war to consider.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The first is a global nuclear war involving the US and Russia. In this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. This is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The other main scenario is a 'regional conflict', for example between India and Pakistan. In this case at least 100 smaller nuclear weapons would be used out of stockpiles of around 200 weapons striking mainly large densely populated super cities such as Delhi and Karachi. A North Korea – US scenario could be similar but with fewer but larger warheads being used.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "Since the Cold War, both the US and Russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. This nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. But this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. Now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks.

As a result, there would be no hope of treatment for severe injuries including burns, broken bones, deep cuts from flying debris.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "To add to the multiple impacts, most locations in Western Europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. You may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. Radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. Children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.", "label": 4}

The latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional India-Pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. A 1,800 US - Russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°C, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°C. This is greater than the average cooling of 5°C experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Whilst an average cooling of only a few degrees may not sound very serious, the crucial impact is much longer periods of frost in winter and severe drought. There would be dramatically reduced growing seasons or even the impossibility of growing any crop as planned. Farming also relies upon supplies of fuel for mechanised planting and harvesting.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Realistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. Assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. It has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The only conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that any use of nuclear weapons would be a global disaster and cause unacceptable suffering. Nuclear weapons do not keep us safe but under a constant threat of disaster. We now know we have avoided this only by sheer luck in several nuclear close-calls. In 2017, this understanding led 122 countries at the United Nations, to support a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in the same fashion as chemical and biological weapons and to press the nuclear-armed states to negotiate major reductions in weapons.

It argues that McDonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs.

This omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. Yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. Congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 Farm Bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the U.S.", "label": 4}

At the same time, one in seven Americans are food insecure. Much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure American.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "There are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. For example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. Broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. For other programs, directing USDA to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Congress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. Currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. Misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. The upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. Industry groups are already on board—the Food Marketing Institute and Grocery Manufacturers Association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The 2018 Farm Bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. Many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. In Massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. Measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure.

Middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though I had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and I've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). One tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. So districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school K-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "In a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. In Pennsylvania, AP test results can count toward a school's ranking.

{"sentence": "Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN on Friday that she definitely will seek the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, ending months of speculation.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Her bid makes sense on its face: Democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like Gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (She is a military veteran and was the first Hindu member of Congress.) Much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. In 2016, she surrendered a plum Democratic National Committee post so she could endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and argue top Democrats were unfairly helping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Progressives are already welcoming the news: Let them make their case and we'll find out who has the most compelling narrative, commentator Cenk Uygur said of Gabbard's taking on left favorites Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose 2020 plans are already in motion.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "But the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond America's shores. Like Sanders and Warren, Gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. What she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "On domestic matters, Gabbard is in line with her counterparts: She supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says Democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. Yet on foreign policy, she's gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every Democrat (and Republicans like President Donald Trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by American empire.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Gabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the U.S. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. It's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that Trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of Iraq. (Why have politicians of both parties gotten Americans trapped in these far-away places?)", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "And it connects seamlessly to another Trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly Muslims. Gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from Iraq and Syria to enter the U.S., courted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite his links to anti-Muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a Fox News darling for her willingness to claim President Barack Obama was making Americans less safe by supporting Arab rebels in Syria and not using the phrase radical Islam. (Obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; Gabbard and Trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the Islamic State.)", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What Sanders and Warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of U.S. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not Americans' problem. They're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with Clinton and many Republicans — the idea that U.S.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. They have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like Russia for the sake of American global standing. Instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of U.S. citizens as well as people abroad.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The Sanders/Warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the U.S. and in rivals like Russia and China. In that view, challenging the status quo of American foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as Gabbard did with brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-American regimes like Assad's or U.S. partners like Saudi Arabia.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "There's a mass feeling across the public… that Trump has walked away from what are perceived as American values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, Hurlburt said. She sees Sanders and Warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "As the race takes shape, Gabbard's rivals ― of whom there are likely to be many ― will know they can make political hay of her controversial views and over episodes like her visit to Assad amid his devastating campaign against his own people.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. Gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the Sanders Institute, founded by the senator's wife, Jane Sanders, and frequently posturing as the Democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed Trump's strike against Assad in 2017.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The quiet hope among backers of Sanders and Warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.", "label": 4}

I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "JENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...", "label": 5}

So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse.

India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality.

But there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. Should he have said more sooner?", "label": 5}

And he was not about to let Donald Trump live in an alternate bubble. And I think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. And he - and - you know, convinced most of the Republicans in the Senate that the Republicans should not indulge what Donald Trump was doing. It's, I think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.", "label": 5}

They didn't repeat the president's lies quite so much as just saying, look; there are allegations we should investigate. But this is an obvious cynical ploy. Why do you think a large part of the party was addicted to that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: Well, I think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. And to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. The president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. These things are decided in the courts and at the state level. And to go on the Senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. They wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.", "label": 5}

Denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.", "label": 5}

If it is and it works, OK, he'll get credit for that. But to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.", "label": 5}

And it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what I would call, like a blind Samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of World War II. Those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera.

And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.", "label": 5}

Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?", "label": 5}

Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "COSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "His transition team says he'll change a Trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Instead, the Biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. For people who've gotten initial shots, the Biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "According to CDC, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health — who advises both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration on the federal COVID-19 response — tells NPR there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The Biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. They are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. They feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The Biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, Biden's incoming press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing Friday. The president-elect has said he will use the Defense Production Act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "However, Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the Trump administration, defends its current policy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The head of the Association of Immunization Managers, Claire Hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. The goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. Get it, thaw it, give it. [Then] order the second dose. Don't try to store it at CDC, don't try to store it at McKesson.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that this is a good move. He says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, Lipsitch says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. This is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. It could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.", "label": 5}

The big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Our hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Here are six takeaways from Biden's inauguration:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "1. A starkly different tone was set.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that Biden struck. Gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of Donald Trump. Instead, America saw a staid and humble President Biden. Instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, Biden said. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For a significant portion of the country, Biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the Trump presidency. Some Republicans even praised his speech. For another large group of Americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Overall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to COVID-19 and threats, it seemed like Washington was headed for something of a return to normal.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the U.S. Capitol on the first three Wednesdays of this January: one of the Jan. 6 violence, one of Trump's impeachment and then one of Biden's inauguration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "2. Real unity will be tough to come by.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, Biden did something Trump rarely did — reach out to those who didn't vote for him. And he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To all those who did not support us, Biden said, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Certainly, this was no Trump American carnage speech. But tone is one thing, and policy is another.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but only very narrowly. Biden will likely need Republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Speaking of those priorities, Biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in America. They include addressing COVID-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. He is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Biden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. But you can bet that Republicans will find plenty to disagree with Democrats about in how to solve those issues. And what of unity then? More importantly, what of solving those issues when Biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of Republican opposition?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Biden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But there's only so far those executive orders can go.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When hearing of Trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many Trump supporters dismissed the criticism that Trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: Oh, come on. All politicians lie.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, not like what was seen these past four years. Trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to The Washington Post. That's an average of 20 per day.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. Then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. But Trump could not be shamed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. And Biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. But there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "In late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Normally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "UC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Warren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Also important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.", "label": 5}

As another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on Capitol Hill emerged with a deal Monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's Department of Homeland Security funding bill).

With this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from Washington, allowing Tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend Medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Dan Diamond, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. As I was walking into the studio, Terry, I saw the European Union had put out a statement slamming the U.S. for taking this step without even informing them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: What are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: We seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. The NBA suspended the season. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. So have we reached a new stage? And what does that mean?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Well, in many ways, the World Health Organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. This virus is here. It is around the world. It is spreading. It is putting many people at risk.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. A lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the United States.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of Americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Cities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But at this point, we do not have, from the White House, any clear directive on what the country should do. And with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: You know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the Trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. What went wrong?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: And it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Why didn't the U.S. use the World Health Organization's test?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: If you or your listeners know the answer to that, I would love...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: It's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the United States is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: I think at this point, Terry, South Korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the United States has done in the past two months. South Korea can do 10,000 tests per day. At last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: What do you think the impact is of the lost time?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: I think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and I think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. We are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the United States. If there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And when I look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. The president has driven a lot of those people away. That has weakened the response across government. It has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. And in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Are there cuts the Trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? For example, wasn't there a National Security Council health task force that was disbanded under Trump?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Something I found very interesting - and I'd love to hear your take on this - is that Tucker Carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on Fox News - he has been one of Trump's strongest advocates. And Trump seems to listen, you know, to watch Tucker Carlson's show. So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself. What do you make of that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: My guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. After a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: What is it about his management style that's so alienating?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. But his critics would say that Alex Azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: My impression is that he is anti-abortion. He has described HHS as the department of life. He described the Trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. He said that in a very admiring way. How has that affected him as the leader of HHS? And was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: OK. Thank you for the (laughter) clarification. So how does their desire to please Trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? And that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "More recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Meanwhile, Alex Azar has been the point person on President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices. Azar has pitched himself as the fixer. He worked in the drug industry at Eli Lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "So you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Meanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Well, let's take a look at Robert Redfield, who's the head of the Centers for Disease Control. And he was a well-known AIDS researcher, and you say he was a favorite of Christian conservatives when Trump appointed him in 2018. He helped fight HIV-AIDS in Africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. Can you tell us more about that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Those views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So is there a decision, for better or worse, that Redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the U.S. for better or worse?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Vice President Pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. Seema Verma, who is the head of Medicare and Medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of Indiana. Jerome Adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the Pence administration. When Alex Azar was in Indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he became connected to Mike Pence.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "While Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "In your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "That story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back. I'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Behind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "DIAMOND: The information that I have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. One reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now.

From a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the Paris climate accord.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Within the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. A central argument of my book, Living Well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously — and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A central feature of Americans' understanding and promotion of opportunity to live well has been a focused on fair terms of access to employment. Promoting fair competition for employment and equal access to the education and training needed to acquire job qualifications makes sense.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "However, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. The evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. Comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. Nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. And we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. Those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So what is inherently involved in living well?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In addressing this question, my geoscientist coauthor Ellen Metzger and I have had the benefit of collaborations with psychologist colleagues, Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. Their research in self-determination theory, conducted over the course of four decades with a network of 500 collaborators in 39 countries, has found that the experience of happiness is regulated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs to feel competent, self-determining, and positively related to other people in the activities of one's life. These are universal needs, observed across all stages of life and in every culture in which studies have been conducted, and they help explain the truth in the ancient ideal of eudaimonia, or human flourishing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "According to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. My work with Ryan and Deci identifies three broad forms of potential — social, intellectual, and productive/creative — the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. Fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. Societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. It should be evident to any observer of life in the U.S. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most Americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As counterintuitive as it may seem, we could be happier both now and in the future if we could overcome the blind faith in wealth accumulation that shaped the socially, politically and environmentally unstable world with which we must now contend.", "label": 5}

First, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis quit. And America's chief diplomat in the fight against ISIS, Brett McGurk, soon followed. Now, the timeline for a full withdrawal is unclear. I never said we're doing it that quickly. He went on to say that the U.S. will leave at a proper pace while continuing to fight ISIS, a shift from — They're all coming back, and they're coming back now. The nearly eight-year-long war in Syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. [explosion] So, how did we get here and what are U.S. forces doing in Syria? In 2011, uprisings rippled through the Middle East. Leaders fell in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. And after months of anti-government protests in Syria, the U.S. had a message for President Bashar al-Assad: This morning, President Obama called on Assad to step aside.

In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated.

The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.)

A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip.

{"sentence": "When it comes to FAFSA forms, money in a retirement plan, including a 401(k) and IRA, is not counted as part of your assets or investments, Kantrowitz said.

That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach.

Whether it was the initial Bush administration strategy on Afghanistan, the McChrystal review early in the Obama years, or any of the subsequent Obama/Trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Nonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. Even more to the point for Americans, the United States has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within Afghan borders. The United States probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.", "label": 7}

It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Of course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Al-Qaida remains present in Afghanistan and just over the border in Pakistan, where drones flying from bases in Afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. The presence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Afghanistan has been growing, too. Neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the United States.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Even so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of America's and NATO's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. Thus, Trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-Qaida and ISIS.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Some will say terrorism in and near Afghanistan can be checked even without an American military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the Taliban. Perhaps any future al-Qaida or ISIS presence on Afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the Indian Ocean. Or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in Afghanistan.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "But that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "With 5,000 American troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in Afghanistan, the United States could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at Bagram near Kabul in the nation's center, near Kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either Khost or Jalalabad in the east. It also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in Kabul, to help the Afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "It's time to leave Afghanistan:Take the deal, President Trump; 18 years is enough", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. It would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the Afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Committing to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to Pakistan and the Taliban that the new U.S. president would not be expecting a Hail Mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. Perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The United States needs a policy that recognizes Afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, U.S. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly.

{"sentence": "After a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. But a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. In fact, nearly half of U.S. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And that's a problem, because Social Security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. Or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. Neither is ideal.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Of course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to.

For the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. For the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. Max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "A big reason Americans are stuck living paycheck to paycheck is their tendency to save too little and spend too much. If you'd rather break that cycle, then here's what you need to do.

Only once you have that budget in place will you be in a good position to identify which bills to slash.", "label": 7}

There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for.

The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced.

{"sentence": "• Whether a part can be fixed or needs to be replaced. For instance, a garage's estimate might call for replacing a body panel, but an insurer might want the body shop to try repairing it first, says Dan Risley, president of the shop owners group Automotive Service Association.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• What kind of replacement part to use. Sometimes an insurer will not pay for a part from the original manufacturer, insisting a used part or cheaper aftermarket version is good enough. Some high-end insurance policies guarantee use of original manufacturer parts.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• How long repairs should take. A repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, Risley says. Each extra hour is more labor cost. And each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• The labor rate. A garage might have a per-hour cost that's more than an insurer is willing to pay.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• Whether there are errors in the estimate. An estimate might call for replacement of a part that isn't damaged or omit something that does need repair.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Disagreements tend to be resolved fairly quickly, Barry says. It generally goes pretty smoothly, because the auto insurers and the auto body repair shops are going to be seeing one another again frequently, he notes.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "But such situations are considerably more rare for the rest of us, who might also have opinions about how our cars should be fixed. Your influence will depend on your insurance policy and state regulations. For instance, the contract might spell out what kind of parts can be used.", "label": 7}

It's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any U.S. Embassies that they were in peril. National security adviser Robert O'Brien dodged the question when it was asked.

Making the rounds of the Sunday shows, Esper said only that the president believed the attacks were possible, and that therefore he believes the president.

Why lie when the truth is compelling? Why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?", "label": 7}

It might well be true that any day when Soleimani is taken out of action is a good day.

Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.", "label": 7}

The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers.

{"sentence": "Full retirement age is set to change soon", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Once you turn 62, you become eligible for Social Security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at full retirement age. For anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. But for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase.", "label": 7}

This two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Why does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "But someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Whether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. In other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work – or at least delay filing for Social Security if they don't work – in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Social Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "But if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. Here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death:", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "This table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.", "label": 7}

Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.", "label": 7}

The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft.

The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said.

The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday.

The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line.

A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov.

However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants.

More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.", "label": 8}

The Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. The benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.", "label": 8}

Employers have been paying out bonuses equal to 4.7% of wages and salaries for management, professional and related fields, but just 0.8% for service employees. The announcements make clear the bonuses are for the rank and file, not management.", "label": 8}

{"sentence": "Politically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. It was filed days after the departure of one Democratic commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior Democrat, Tom Wheeler, is due to step down. Both moves will leave the FCC with a two-Republican majority and a one-Democrat minority, allowing the GOP to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into the Oval Office.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Do you even need an unlimited plan?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This is the first question you'll want to answer before you grapple with the carriers' various offerings. Let's say you don't use your mobile data for very much beyond basic Web browsing and email. Or maybe the bulk of your smartphone usage happens while you're at home or at the office, where there's WiFi. Under those conditions, you might be better off signing up for a metered plan — that is, one with a monthly data cap.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "These plans tend to be more affordable than the typical unlimited data plan, assuming you stay within your data limits. For example, the difference in price between a 2 GB plan on Verizon and an unlimited plan on the same network is about $45 a month for a single line.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Exceeding your monthly cap on a metered plan could result in additional fees or reduced browsing speeds. If you find yourself blowing past your limit on a regular basis, you might consider upgrading to a larger data bucket or to an unlimited plan.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "To figure out how much data you use in a month, follow these steps if you're an Android user and these instructions if you're on iOS. Spend a few weeks analyzing your habits, and some useful trends should emerge.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Unlimited plans benefit heavy data users", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If you stream lots of music or video over 3G or 4G LTE, then you may want to consider an unlimited plan. But which service to choose? Here's our side-by-side comparison of all the major carriers' offerings. We'll highlight particular points of interest below, but consider this a starting point.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "As you can see, while it may be tempting simply to choose the cheapest option, there are a ton of other factors that may shape your decision.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Many of these plans come with a trade-off of some kind or another, meaning that although they vastly expand the amount of data you're allowed to use compared with other plans, they're still not technically unlimited as their marketing may imply.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "AT&T, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, DirecTV or U-verse. It doesn't matter if you already have AT&T cellular service but not TV, or vice versa. You just need to end up with both phone and TV service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. This might not make sense if you already get your TV service through a company such as Comcast or Verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to TV. Note that DirecTV Now, AT&T's online streaming TV service, doesn't count toward this program. So if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (Update: AT&T has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of AT&T's TV services.)", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for T-Mobile or Sprint. Both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; Sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 Mbps and video to 480p resolution. This means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. There doesn't appear to be a way around Sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "T-Mobile's approach to content is a little more mixed. Customers of its unlimited plan, T-Mobile One, can choose whether to view online videos at reduced quality or at full HD resolution starting Feb. 17 for no extra charge (HD capabilities now cost an additional $15 per month per line).", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This offers greater flexibility, but for those who constantly stream at full HD, there are other risks to consider. Use too much data (more than 28 GB in a month) and T-Mobile may decide to slow down your connection.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "T-Mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 GB a month. This may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their Internet usage to a residential broadband plan.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Can I share my phone's connection to a PC?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If you need to do some work on your laptop but there's no WiFi, one option is to share your phone's data connection with your PC. If this is important to you, you may want to choose Verizon or T-Mobile because they offer a lot of tethering data. Verizon's unlimited plan supports up to 10 GB of hotspot usage per month right out of the box, while T-Mobile plans to make 10 GB of monthly hotspot data available to T-Mobile One customers beginning Friday.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "What do I get if I travel a lot?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If you frequently travel to Canada or Mexico, T-Mobile arguably offers the easiest solution in its unlimited plan. Data roaming is included for those countries, and you don't have to go out of your way to add on a roaming package. You use your data just like you would in the United States. T-Mobile was also the first to liberalize its broader international roaming policies, which remain pretty competitive.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "What if I have a grandfathered unlimited plan?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If you signed up for an older unlimited plan years ago before companies such as AT&T and Verizon stopped selling unlimited plans, should you switch? The answer depends on what you're paying and whether some of the restrictions mentioned above are dealbreakers for you.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "As an example, suppose you're paying $90 a month for a single grandfathered unlimited plan on Verizon, as this person does. (Note: This is an actual Verizon bill provided by a customer to The Washington Post. The customer provided it on the condition of anonymity to protect their personal financial information.)", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "It costs $39.99 a month for the phone line, plus $49.99 for the unlimited data. Because you can't have the unlimited data without the voice service, we can treat the sum as the effective cost of the unlimited plan. This person receives a few discounts here and there that appear tailored to their particular situation, so let's simply use the $90 base figure and move on.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Compared with the price of one of the new Verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. So switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. Because the customer used only about 7.9 GB of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to Verizon's 8 GB plan. But that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But the Taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands.

{"sentence": "Pompeo called the moment historic and said the Taliban needed to live up to commitments to break with al-Qaeda and reduce violence.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which U.S., Afghan and Taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. The agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue.

{"sentence": "Under the deal, the Afghan government must assemble a negotiating team that will work with the Taliban to agree on the makeup of the country's new government. The peace deal stipulates that those talks must begin by March 10.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Ghani faces the challenge of building an inclusive negotiating team to represent the Afghans who are not aligned with the Taliban. The announcement of disputed election results earlier this month has left the government in Kabul deeply divided and has the potential to undermine Ghani's mandate to form that team.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Another potential obstacle is a planned prisoner exchange. The text of the peace deal released by the State Department said the prisoner swap — the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners in Afghan custody for about 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces in Taliban captivity — must occur by March 10 when inter-Afghan talks are set to start.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Shaheen also suggested there may be some gray area in the Taliban's commitment not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil to plan and launch attacks against the United States and its allies.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A peace deal with the Taliban has been a critical foreign policy goal for Trump, who campaigned on ending the war. But he has faced fierce criticism from the Afghan government as well as from fellow Republicans at home.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Afghan officials have repeatedly criticized the United States for excluding them from talks with the Taliban. Any significant withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country is expected to place increased pressure on Afghan government forces, whose casualty rates continue to rise.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Wonder Woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. But while it's a pretty bad DC Comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes DC Comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid Washington, D.C. movie. Given Hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see WW84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the District and its residents can be.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The bad first: WW84 is scattershot and nonsensical, seemingly designed solely around a desire to get pilot Steve Trevor, who died in the first film, back for a second go-round, even if that means negating his heroic sacrifice.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "To that end, writers Patty Jenkins (who also directed) and Geoff Johns introduce Maxwell Lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. Where previous entries in the DC expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and Wonder Woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane You can't always get what you want or Be careful what you wish for.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "All of this would be fine if the action sequences were any good; sadly, they are not. Perhaps it's just a function of watching this at home via HBO Max, as most people will, but everything on screen felt cheap and bland. There's nothing as exciting as the German assault on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira or her march through a World War I No Man's Land in the first film; everything is weightless and silly.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Still, it's not all bad, and Wonder Woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. Unlike many Hollywood productions, the movie uses actual D.C. locations for both interior and exterior shots. Watching Wonder Woman stride through the iconic Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's entry and take a resurrected Steve on a tour of D.C.'s Metro system gave the picture a genuine Washington flair so often absent from movies like this. Big setpieces that take place on actual Washington streets in sight of the Capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the Watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the Reflecting Pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This fealty to D.C. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a Silver Line (or a Green Line!) in 1984, a pass. And it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get Toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for D.C.: WW84 joins Breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of D.C. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "More than that, though, WW84 nails the mood of a certain sort of D.C. resident who believes that earning an internship in the White House would be enough to give a gangly young dork the gumption to ask a literal Amazon goddess out on a date.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Indeed, in its treatment of folks around town — from the mousy-but-competent workers such as Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) who get lost in the bureaucracy that employs them to the full-of-themselves donors and interns who operate the shadow economy that keeps D.C.'s institutions running — WW84 has a lot in common with Shattered Glass, Billy Ray's movie about the fabulist Stephen Glass, who almost took down the New Republic. That movie captured the sociology of D.C., with its weird mélange of poor pay, idealism and naked ambition in the service of jockeying for social position, in a way that few others have managed. Like that movie, WW84 shows how Washington's institutions and mores leave it at risk of being corrupted.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "And while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — Ronald Reagan, the architect of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, would have been unlikely to use Maxwell Lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. I will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of Israel Defense Forces vet Gadot taking apart the Egyptian King of Crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. Few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line.

{"sentence": "Mr. Stewart ran into serious controversy in the 1990s when, with the gay rights movement blossoming, he was attacked for his no-gay policy at Sandals resorts. The initial policy, from 1981, was that Sandals resorts, starting with the first one at Montego Bay, would be for couples (heterosexuals) only. At the time, homosexuality was still illegal in Jamaica.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Beginning in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order denying work to those suspected of sexual perversion, thousands of gay men and women were forced out of the federal bureaucracy. While the exact number of victims claimed by this lavender scare is difficult to quantify, one scholar estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people were affected, far exceeding those expelled in the simultaneous (not to mention much more extensively documented and remembered) red scare.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Many gay and lesbian workers quietly resigned rather than face humiliating security interrogations, others committed suicide without leaving an explanation, and untold numbers never even applied for jobs due to the prohibition on their employment. It was not until 1995, when President Bill Clinton signed an executive order reversing the Eisenhower measure, that sexual orientation was removed from the list of conditions justifying the denial of a security clearance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the Cold War was twofold. The first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. Because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. So shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The genesis for this belief lay in the career of Col. Alfred Redl. A gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the Austro-Hungarian army, Redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to Russia in 1913. Redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his Russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late Belle Époque Vienna. However, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that Redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the Russians over it.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The revelation of Redl's treason just before the outbreak of World War I inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. Over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. Five decades after Redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the Austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Indicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of Washington politics Advise and Consent, later made into a hit film directed by Otto Preminger. The book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. Although Advise and Consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Fears about gay Americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the Cold War. Previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. In 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. Nonetheless, Hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. Hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of Congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Hillenkoetter alluded to a case that year involving a Soviet intelligence operation wherein our task will be made considerably easier by the appearance in the area of a known homosexual who we think will be extremely helpful in this particular case.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the Cold War inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. The specter of a Homosexual International, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful Communist one. A series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 1948, Time magazine journalist Whittaker Chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, was a member of his cell. While Chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, Hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Likewise, when British diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean defected to the Soviet Union in 1951, and two National Security Agency cryptologists, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, fled to Moscow in 1960, many attributed their defections to deviant sexualities.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Although Burgess was openly gay and Mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. Nonetheless, pressure from the FBI over the Burgess affair led the British government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the Foreign Service, and media portrayed Martin and Mitchell as lovers.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay Americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. Never in American history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. The more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist Joe Alsop in 1957. When the KGB entrapped him having sex with another man in a Moscow hotel room, Alsop marched straight to the American Embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. Years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across Washington, Alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the Soviet regime.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Moreover, it never seemed to cross the minds of intelligence professionals like Roscoe Hillenkoetter or the senators questioning him that a gay person was by necessity someone skilled at keeping secrets in a homophobic society and therefore might actually be predisposed for espionage work.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The 1969 Stonewall uprising against police harassment at a Greenwich Village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. But a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in Washington, D.C., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as House speaker, despite dissent.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Why do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? Parties make a critical trade-off. They empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. But those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This is what my research shows", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "My research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. I support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Parties face a dilemma when writing rules. If the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the Rules Committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. But if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Since the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. A variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "House chamber and Democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the House. Since the November elections, Pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. That included creating a leadership position for Rep. Barbara Lee; reviving the House administration subcommittee on elections for Rep. Marcia L. Fudge to chair; and promising the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group within the House that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Pelosi's entrenchment echoes that of Boehner (2011-2015): The Ohio Republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every GOP House member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "To be sure, Boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. He ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. Still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly Boehner neutralized potential rivals.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Past partisans often preferred weaker leaders", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Parties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. Throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. As a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Only the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers Nicholas Longworth (R), 1925-1931, and Sam Rayburn (D), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. Party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. With leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as Charles Halleck (R), 1959-1965; Frederick Gillett (R) 1919-1925; and John McCormack (D) 1962-1971.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This system had serious shortcomings. When party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the House struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. For example, McCormack failed to pass most of the Kennedy legislative program in the 87th Congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large Democratic majority.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "As parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. But a leader who engendered dissent within the party like Pelosi likely would not have survived.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Pelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If Democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until Pelosi leaves office. Since Pelosi was elected House minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Consider the rule changes to which Pelosi reportedly agreed. The changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. Pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But that is not a significant change. The rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. The new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. The other promised changes have such large loopholes that Pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the House floor.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Likewise, Pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. In 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as House speaker. She will have served as the top Democrat in the House for 19 years. If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, Pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. And if the Republican experience provides any guidance, Democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.", "label": 9}

Some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as Pokemon Go, are not on them, Hersman said. And a survey cited by the Council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "There's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. Hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. Some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. Over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a Saturday night. In a 2010 case in Texas cited by the Council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "So it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. A National Safety Council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. Hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as Cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use.

{"sentence": "In 2012, the Colts released Peyton Manning, knowing that they were set to draft Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick.

In addition to the permanent Beta Theta Pi ban, a total of 13 other Greek organizations at Penn State have received multiyear suspensions for safety violations.

In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option.

Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap.

Having lured Osweiler away from the Broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, Houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter.

That may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what NBA teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the NFL, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. In any event, if it helps land the highly regarded Garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the Browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A second-round pick in 2014, Garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when Tom Brady was serving his Deflategate suspension.

{"sentence": "Tuesday, January 26, 1999; Page E1 Intel Corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the Internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. The turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott Intel products in protest of the chip's ID component. This is a significant victory for privacy, said Barry Steinhardt, associate director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who praised Intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. They did it on Internet time. In announcing the ID feature of the new Pentium III microprocessor last week, Intel officials described it as an important step for Internet security. The ID number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. While each chip still will have a unique number, Intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the ID function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif., company, acknowledged that Intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. We're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, Mulloy said.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "You must account for privacy if you're going to have security. But some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. Computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. Instead, users must electronically fetch the program from Intel's Web site. In addition, the utility program is available only for Windows software. -Those who use the Linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. Privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the World Wide Web – in essence, allowing businesses at those Web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other Web sites. The default for privacy should be no ID number, said David Banisar, policy director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a advocacy group in Washington that helped organize the Intel boycott. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass. ), ranking member of the Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. I have great concerns about any unique identifier Web sites might use without any rules, said Markey, who wrote a letter to Intel complaining about the chip last week. © Copyright The Washington Post Company Back to the top", "label": 9}

For service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. Currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. These choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.", "label": 9}

Our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many U.S. military installations. Children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their K-12 years.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The result: Over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. As the Military Child Education Coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality.

{"sentence": "A new assessment of several states with large military populations found that military families face a number of education obstacles, with the performance of students varying dramatically depending on geography. The Lexington Institute concluded that a shortage of high-quality educational programs for military-connected students, such as Advanced Placement classes in high school, often restricts educational opportunities, negatively impacts educational achievement, causes military families to make tough choices, inhibits quick assimilation into school communities, and can reduce a family's satisfaction with a military career.", "label": 9}

Former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This strikes me as a typical Trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of Afghanistan, says former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to prop up one faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) against another. Their invasion catalyzed the existing Islamist opposition to the PDPA but I digress. (In other words, Trump's claim Russia went into Afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.)

If Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would Russian President Vladimir Putin go back in?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "I am glad Trump brought up the end of the Soviet Union, however. The U.S.S.R. didn't magically change its name; the West won the Cold War (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things Trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran.", "label": 9}

Cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious Trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, The president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of U.S. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the United States has sustained for nearly eight decades. He explains, The real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the United States should accept a more modest role in world affairs.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "We should be worried, as Cohen points out, that Trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for America. Perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among American leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of U.S. foreign policy. . . . Trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the United States is merely one great power among others. In this view, Washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of U.S. leaders so carefully built.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "In a nutshell, Robb argues that trade — rather than national security — dominates Trump's foreign policy thinking, inverting decades of U.S. practice. By implication, that makes any country running a large trade surplus with the United States a direct competitor.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "If Robb is right, that's very bad news for China, but it doesn't make welcome reading for countries such as Mexico, Germany and Japan. Unless they can take steps to reduce their trade imbalances with the United States, they are unlikely to be fully trusted by a man who sees trade as a zero-sum game, and sees anyone beating the United States as a threat.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "First, here's the analysis, in Robb's own words:", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Since WW2, U.S. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. In fact, it's hard to imagine a U.S. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. This means that ALL other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. In particular, U.S. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the Cold War) even if these trade relationships damage U.S. economic performance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump inverts that policy relationship. In Trump's post-Cold War world, U.S. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. Even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. If trade policy is dominant, we'll see China, Mexico and the EU (Germany) become competitors. Russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "So what does this mean in practice? China runs by far the largest trade surplus with the United States, some $319 billion in 2016. That's nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. In fact, China bought just $104 billion in U.S. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the United States.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "No surprise, then, that Trump took less than 10 seconds into the first presidential debate to slam China for devaluing its currency and stealing American jobs.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump, of course, has also taken issue with China over its island-building in the South China Sea, and he has publicly questioned American adherence to the one-China policy, the basis for diplomatic relations between the two countries that rules out independence for the island of Taiwan.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But the implication of the trade-first philosophy is that neither Taiwan nor the South China Sea really matters to Trump, except as ways to beat up on a country he sees as a direct economic threat.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Indeed, he has suggested as much, telling Fox News last month that he didn't know why the United States had to be bound by the one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in U.S.-China relations is probably here to stay, as long as Trump sticks around in the White House.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Beijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and Trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from Asia to the United States. But China's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "National security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. For example, military tension with China creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the U.S. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). In a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the U.S. The U.S. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the U.S. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Of course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. Indeed, China's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across Asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the United States. Yet Robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The second-largest U.S. trade deficit in 2016 was with Japan, at $62.4 billion. Japan largely got a pass from the United States when it used protectionism and state subsidies to build its industries after World War II: then, it was seen as a key strategic ally worth supporting despite running a large trade surplus with the United States.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. Japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. He has also warned Toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in Mexico, and he argued that Japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing U.S. troops in Okinawa.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The same goes for South Korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. Trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the Obama administration.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Third on the list comes Germany, with a trade surplus with the United States running at $59.6 billion in 2016.

His criticism may have been unjustified, as Bertel Schmidt argues in Forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump has accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of ruining the country with her immigration policy, and the two leaders clearly have a very different worldview. But perhaps trade is the real root of Trump's distrust of Germany.", "label": 9}

Leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. These autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. But an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. Let's look at how that works.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "First, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. Governing parties may also create a biased news media. In Malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Governing parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. The most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win.

That brings significant advantages. For example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Fidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with Orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power.

(The closure of 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) Where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. It was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments.

In fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too.
