{"sentence": "the president has sought to put a positive spin on the situation, telling reporters late last year that acting department heads give him more flexibility, yet there's a downside to that. not only does it strip congress of its oversight role in approving the president's top officials, experts say interim officials are limited in their ability to make long-term and strategic decisions because they are not likely to hold their positions.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "first, with the amex gold, you'll earn 4 points for every dollar you spend on restaurants worldwide, and on up to $25,000 in annual purchases at us supermarkets (1 point per dollar thereafter). most food delivery services count as restaurants on this card, so that means the vast majority of your food purchases will earn 4x points, regardless of how you're eating right now.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "the president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. here are three ways this is happening:", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "president obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "in past decisions, the u.s. supreme court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. it is subject to restrictions. the doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. it applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "by contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "it is true that president ronald reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. but his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law congress had already passed. his exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, president george h. w. bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by congress. the point is instructive. the actions by reagan and bush are not a supporting precedent for mr. obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "however, president obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. it has become his political gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with congress. he contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. he treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "our constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. congress is vested with writing laws and the president is charged with executing those laws. this is especially true when it comes to immigration.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "at the end of the 19th century, the supreme court declared that congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. derived from article 1, section 8 of the constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. as the high court observed, over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "yet president obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. in so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. he is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "president obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. article ii, section 3 requires that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. he cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. to infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. president obama admitted as much when he said, the fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that i have to enforce. he was specifically talking about immigration laws.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "in 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "if president obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? after all, he has frequently threatened, where congress won't act, i will. what is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? or to act where congress has declined or refused to act? can he abolish certain tax laws because congress chooses to keep them? can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? if so, why even have a legislative branch of government? what's the point of a constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "1. a starkly different tone was set.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "if there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that biden struck. gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of donald trump. instead, america saw a staid and humble president biden. instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, biden said. rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "for a significant portion of the country, biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the trump presidency. some republicans even praised his speech. for another large group of americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "overall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to covid-19 and threats, it seemed like washington was headed for something of a return to normal.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "for a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the u.s. capitol on the first three wednesdays of this january: one of the jan. 6 violence, one of trump's impeachment and then one of biden's inauguration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "2. real unity will be tough to come by.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "trying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, biden did something trump rarely did — reach out to those who didn't vote for him. and he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "to all those who did not support us, biden said, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. if you still disagree, so be it. that's democracy. that's america. the right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "certainly, this was no trump american carnage speech. but tone is one thing, and policy is another.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. democrats control the white house and both chambers of congress, but only very narrowly. biden will likely need republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and it won't solve the problem of the tens of millions of trump supporters who are fed and believe a daily diet of false information — and who make up the base of the republican party.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "enlarge this image toggle caption alex wong/getty images alex wong/getty images", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "3. biden laid out his priorities.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "speaking of those priorities, biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in america. they include addressing covid-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. he is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "biden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. but you can bet that republicans will find plenty to disagree with democrats about in how to solve those issues. and what of unity then? more importantly, what of solving those issues when biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of republican opposition?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "biden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on covid-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but there's only so far those executive orders can go.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "when hearing of trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many trump supporters dismissed the criticism that trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: oh, come on. all politicians lie.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "well, not like what was seen these past four years. trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to the washington post. that's an average of 20 per day.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "what usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. but trump could not be shamed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. and biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. but there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "5. inaugurations may have changed permanently.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "biden got out of the presidential limo and walked hand in hand with his wife, first lady jill biden, to the white house. for a brief moment, in a tight shot on television, it could have all looked like any other inauguration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but it was not. the walk was drastically curtailed and more heavily guarded compared with past presidential inaugurations. and while there were some people on the street during the walk, there weren't throngs of people lining the streets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it's very likely that inaugurations as we knew them have changed permanently. there may be a return of people to the national mall and even a parade when the coronavirus pandemic finally clears.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "6. the presidency is overwhelming — for anyone.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "despite his decades serving as a senator in washington and even his eight years as vice president, biden was clearly moved by the reality of his new position.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "trump even appeared cowed wednesday by leaving it. on trump's exit from the white house, he stopped to talk to reporters. he looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind — and even thanked the media.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "after walking up to the white house, biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. he then hugged his wife and held the embrace. they took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "gov. tom wolf kicked off the new year with an ambitious climate change goal: reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "pennsylvania is the nation's fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. if cutting emissions to arrive at wolf's targets is achievable, it will require a host of strategies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "one involves far more electric vehicles on the road. in the pittsburgh area, less than 1 percent of car sales are electric, said sarah olexsak, manager of transportation electrification for duquesne light.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the power utility began greening its own fleet in 2017, purchasing electric sedans and trucks to use in lieu of ones powered by gasoline or diesel.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "better planning and incentives to increase electric vehicle use would result in significant greenhouse gas reductions for pennsylvania. that's one suggestion for cutting emissions included in the state's most recent blueprint for addressing climate change, the draft of its climate action plan released by the department of environmental protection every three years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "wolf based his new climate goals off models identified in the plan, which use 2005 as a baseline year for emission levels. as coal-fired power plants shut down amid competition from cleaner natural gas and renewables, pennsylvania is already halfway to his 2025 target.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "making that goal is feasible, said carnegie mellon university professor jay apt, a director of the school's electric industry center.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "wolf has joined other governors in setting similar short- and long-range targets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the idea of having a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2050 will inform choices that we make now because energy investments are very long-lived, apt said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a gas power plant, for example, will operate for decades.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "that's a big shadow that an investment today casts, apt said. having a goal now that articulates out 30 years into the future is quite reasonable.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "many in the environmental community were glad to see the governor set ambitious targets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it's absolutely the goal we need, but the market by itself is not going to get us there. we really need to do it through policy, said mark szybist, senior attorney with the natural resources defense council.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "establishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a limit on emissions is one option. the state could also boost its alternative energy portfolio standard, a law that requires a certain percentage of the state's power mix come from renewables. those ideas will be tough to get through a republican-led legislature.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "lawmakers this year are expected to debate whether to rescue the state's nuclear industry. like coal, it's struggling to compete with gas and renewables. nuclear reactors provide pennsylvania's largest source of carbon-free power, but several are slated to close prematurely.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "keeping those nuclear power plants operating as they are now is a very good low-pollution strategy, apt said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "in announcing his climate goals, wolf did not say if he would support such a plan. he did indicate he wants to go after more natural gas development while striving for lower emissions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "szybist with the nrdc said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the emission reductions we've seen the past few years, i think are not durable, szybist said. they're vulnerable to going back up again unless we figure out energy policy that will really drive development of renewables.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the state has made progress on some policy fronts, joining a group of states developing a clean transportation policy, cracking down on methane leaks and releasing a plan for greater solar energy development.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "policy is most important to drive all this, but businesses and citizens can step up as well, szybist said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "dep's draft climate action plan, which is expected to be finalized soon, accounts for what further action the state could take. it includes policies tied to nuclear, renewables, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and more options for emission reductions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "you're not going to reach the goal with just these strategies, said robert graff of the delaware valley regional planning commission, who's also a member of the state's climate change advisory committee.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "they only get pennsylvania halfway to its 2050 target. but, he said, the plan is a starting point. he said he believes the governor's decision to announce those goals will get people to give the plan more consideration. the state received a federal grant to help develop it, and graff said it's more thorough than in previous years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "maybe, technological advances in energy storage or capturing and storing carbon emissions will make an 80 percent drop easier to achieve, he said. it's also possible that at some point, the federal government could step in with sweeping policies aimed at reducing emissions, or that the public will become more willing to change carbon-intense habits by driving or flying less, for example.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "you have to walk a narrow path between what's effective and what's economically feasible and also what will have less disruption to the way people like to live, graff said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "after mass shootings, action on gun legislation soars at state level", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "gun-control advocates and democrats call for tighter regulations. gun-rights groups and republicans argue that blame shouldn't be put on inanimate objects, but on the people pulling the trigger. both sides dig in. and it seems that nothing changes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a frustrated dallas police chief david brown challenged federal lawmakers to debate gun control earlier this week, saying, do your job. we're doing ours.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "while it's true that congress has failed to pass new gun laws after mass shootings, despite democrat-staged sit-ins, presidential pleas and other vocal efforts, the sense that nothing changes is wrong. at the state level, a lot changes in terms of laws.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "more than 20,400 pieces of gun-related legislation have been proposed following mass shooting events in the past 25 years. of those bills, more than 3,000 have become law, according to a working paper recently released by researchers at the harvard business school.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it's not that nothing changes after a mass shooting, says deepak malhotra, one of the paper's authors. a lot of the action on [gun control] happens across states instead of at the federal level.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation — whether it tightens or loosens gun laws — depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "if you have a republican legislature in your state and you have a mass shooting, the net effect if you look at the actual bills that get passed is there's a significant increase in bills that loosen gun restrictions, malhotra says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "democrat-controlled states showed no such effect. bills that tightened gun regulations did get proposed after mass shootings, just not at a noticeably higher rate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a good example of this is california, where the state's governor recently signed six gun-control bills into law, many of which were in response to the shooting in san bernardino, where 14 people were killed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "we've covered a large spectrum when it comes to gun safety measures, says state sen. kevin de leon, d-los angeles, from high-capacity cartridges to domestic violence and temporary restraining orders.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "six gun laws sounds like a lot, but for comparison, california passed 11 gun-related laws in 2013 and approved four others in 2014. it's not unusual for the deeply blue state to pass a number of laws tightening restrictions on firearms in a given year.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "republican-controlled states are different. gun-related legislation doesn't come up as often as it does in democrat-led states, and when it does, the aim often isn't to tighten regulations, but to loosen them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "take tennessee: last july, a gunman killed four people and injured three more at a military recruiting station and a navy building in chattanooga — two places that were gun-free zones for everyone except police.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "[the shooting] confirmed even more the idea that gun-free zones left those servicemen and women as literally sitting ducks, says state rep. andy holt, r-dresden.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "in response, the state has since approved five bills related to guns, including one sponsored by holt that allows full-time employees of public universities to carry handguns on campuses, where guns were previously banned.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "similar opinions have been voiced in florida, another republican-controlled state, since the orlando shooting. nightclubs like pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. at least one republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in florida.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "democrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists — similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "certainly, it's not going to be an easy vote to win, says state sen. darren soto, d-orlando. but we put something forward that i believe is narrowly tailored for both parties to get behind.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it's hard to predict how the republican-led legislatures in florida and texas will respond to the recent shootings. the scale of the orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. and the fact that the five victims of the dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "supporters from the fossil fuel, construction, ranching and other industries welcome the move, which they've long sought. environmental groups warn it would sideline the climate impacts of highways, pipelines and other projects, and they promise a legal challenge.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old national environmental policy act, or nepa, which has not been updated in decades. as one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. it also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "america is a nation of builders, trump said announcing the move at the white house, whose gleaming new infrastructure used to be the envy of the world. now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the u.s. like a third world country. it's really sad.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "under the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. that could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "environmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "mary neumayr, chair of the white house council on environmental quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "this delay, she says, deprives americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "industry groups say streamlining nepa regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. in a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "environmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to nepa review. for example, it would exempt non-federal projects with little government funding.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "in another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "this is a clearly a conflict of interest, says christy goldfuss, senior vice president at center for american progress. she was a managing director of the white house council on environmental quality during the obama administration.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "in late january, senator elizabeth warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the american conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. it's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. warren calls the policy her ultra-millionaire tax. it would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of french economist thomas piketty, whose book capital in the twenty-first century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with piketty in 2015, is the first u.s. presidential candidate to take up the cause.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the disparity in what americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. jeff bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. but a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "normally progressives like to point to europe for policy success. not this time. the experiment with the wealth tax in europe was a failure in many countries. france's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. only last year, french president emmanuel macron killed it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "in 1990, twelve countries in europe had a wealth tax. today, there are only three: norway, spain, and switzerland. according to reports by the oecd and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "uc berkeley economist gabriel zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the american policy agenda, played a part in designing warren's wealth tax. he says it was designed explicitly with european failures in mind.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "he argues the warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. unlike in the european union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. existing u.s. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the caribbean, they're still on the hook. on top of that, warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "warren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. this higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "also important, zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. and smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt european efforts. some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. it's true, but it creates a huge loophole: buy lots of art! economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but having no exemptions means the u.s. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. indeed, warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the irs enforcement budget. it was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. it turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and a wealth tax may not even be legal. the ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the u.s. constitution. legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. the debate, josh barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: the tom price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. and, yes, politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. and i say our because i was teamed up with my wonderful colleague rachana pradhan. alex azar has been like the forrest gump of republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, azar would pop up in so many notable moments. he clerked for conservative justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. he worked on the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton. and then he was a lawyer working on the florida recount in 2000, bush v. gore. because bush won, alex azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the bush administration, ending up as the no. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at eli lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gross: what is it about his management style that's so alienating?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "diamond: well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. but his critics would say that alex azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gross: my impression is that he is anti-abortion. he has described hhs as the department of life. he described the trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. he said that in a very admiring way. how has that affected him as the leader of hhs? and was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gross: so you've reported that both alex azar, the head of health and human services, and seema verma, the head of medicare and medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please trump. they are also - verma and azar - kind of at war with each other.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "gross: ok. thank you for the (laughter) clarification. so how does their desire to please trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? and that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "meanwhile, alex azar has been the point person on president trump's goal of lowering drug prices. azar has pitched himself as the fixer. he worked in the drug industry at eli lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. but so far, a lot of the plans that the trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. so alex azar also hasn't been able to deliver. and that means both of them are conscious, azar and verma, of the need to show trump that they are delivering. and they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: i think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. in the case of alex azar, he did go to the president in january. he did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. there were aides around trump - kellyanne conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "meanwhile, seema verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. but i've talked to officials who say that seema verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gross: well, let's take a look at robert redfield, who's the head of the centers for disease control. and he was a well-known aids researcher, and you say he was a favorite of christian conservatives when trump appointed him in 2018. he helped fight hiv-aids in africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. can you tell us more about that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: it's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. but i do think, terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from cdc that's been troubling. the failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a cdc problem. the failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that cdc director redfield admitted this week. and at some level, that goes to the leader. these are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the cdc to protect us.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "while pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. and when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "even so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of america's and nato's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. thus, trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-qaida and isis.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "but that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "the united states needs a policy that recognizes afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, u.s. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. that overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "• what kind of replacement part to use. sometimes an insurer will not pay for a part from the original manufacturer, insisting a used part or cheaper aftermarket version is good enough. some high-end insurance policies guarantee use of original manufacturer parts.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• how long repairs should take. a repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, risley says. each extra hour is more labor cost. and each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• the labor rate. a garage might have a per-hour cost that's more than an insurer is willing to pay.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "• whether there are errors in the estimate. an estimate might call for replacement of a part that isn't damaged or omit something that does need repair.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "disagreements tend to be resolved fairly quickly, barry says. it generally goes pretty smoothly, because the auto insurers and the auto body repair shops are going to be seeing one another again frequently, he notes.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "but such situations are considerably more rare for the rest of us, who might also have opinions about how our cars should be fixed. your influence will depend on your insurance policy and state regulations. for instance, the contract might spell out what kind of parts can be used.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "previous administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with iran were too high. the trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him. this is a clear enough narrative that administration officials should be able to go out and tell it to congress, the american people and the international community without shooting themselves in the foot over and over.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "now, inquisitive members of congress, nosy reporters, disloyal democrats and all the other people trump thinks of as his enemies have asked obvious questions about u.s. policy. rather than answer them, trump has sent his national security officials out with a hollywood script about an imminent attack that he says involved four u.s. embassies but refuses to explain to anyone, not even to his trusted surrogates at fox news.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "the story began to unravel as soon as it hit the street. apparently, the threat was so severe that it was worth killing soleimani and courting war with a country of 80 million people. it's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any u.s. embassies that they were in peril. national security adviser robert o'brien dodged the question when it was asked.

{"sentence": "esper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. but again, it raises the baffling problem of why the trump team didn't just make the case that soleimani, like libyan leader moammar gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that u.s. forces finally had a clear shot at him. why lie when the truth is compelling? why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "this is all reminiscent of trump's embroidering of the killing of the leader of the islamic state terrorist group, abu bakr al-baghdadi, an action that is to his credit and will be one of the few unarguably positive additions to this administration's foreign policy record. trump couldn't leave it at a stoic and confident proclamation that the united states killed a ghastly terrorist; instead, he had to pile on ridiculous details about al-baghdadi crying and pleading, things he could not have known and which remain unverified.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "with both al-baghdadi and soleimani, as with so many other moments with this president, trump can't seem to stick to one coherent story. and so we end up talking not about policy, but whether there is something deeply wrong with the commander in chief and whether he can be trusted with american national security.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "the more ominous problem here is that the trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. it might well be true that any day when soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. but trump — like bill clinton ordering an airstrike on iraq the day after the republican house accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "in every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side. this deficit of character is bad enough in a single leader, but when it spreads to an entire administration, it is dangerous to national security and destructive to trust in democracy.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "compared with the price of one of the new verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. so switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. because the customer used only about 7.9 gb of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to verizon's 8 gb plan. but that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "the rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the cold war was twofold. the first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. so shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "the genesis for this belief lay in the career of col. alfred redl. a gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the austro-hungarian army, redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to russia in 1913. redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late belle époque vienna. however, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the russians over it.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "fears about gay americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the cold war. previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. in 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, roscoe hillenkoetter, the first director of the central intelligence agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. nonetheless, hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "since the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. a variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "parties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. as a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "only the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers nicholas longworth (r), 1925-1931, and sam rayburn (d), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. with leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as charles halleck (r), 1959-1965; frederick gillett (r) 1919-1925; and john mccormack (d) 1962-1971.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "if democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until pelosi leaves office. since pelosi was elected house minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "i am glad trump brought up the end of the soviet union, however. the u.s.s.r. didn't magically change its name; the west won the cold war (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). putin views the fall of the soviet union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing russia as a great power, which trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing syria to russia and its ally iran.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "since ww2, u.s. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. in fact, it's hard to imagine a u.s. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. this means that all other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. in particular, u.s. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the cold war) even if these trade relationships damage u.s. economic performance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "trump inverts that policy relationship. in trump's post-cold war world, u.s. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. if trade policy is dominant, we'll see china, mexico and the eu (germany) become competitors. russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "so what does this mean in practice? china runs by far the largest trade surplus with the united states, some $319 billion in 2016. that's nearly half of the u.s. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. in fact, china bought just $104 billion in u.s. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the united states.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "beijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from asia to the united states. but china's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "national security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. for example, military tension with china creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the u.s. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). in a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the u.s. the u.s. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the u.s. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "of course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. indeed, china's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the united states. yet robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "trump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. he has also warned toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in mexico, and he argued that japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing u.s. troops in okinawa.", "label": 9}
