it is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.

killingly: the killingly board of education voted to bring back a controversial native american-themed athletic mascot. the board decided to reinstate the redmen mascot at a meeting wednesday, the norwich bulletin reported. in october, the same board approved the new red hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at killingly high school. several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. it featured the profile of a native american man wearing a headdress. newly elected republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. the board, with a republican majority, held a public meeting on dec. 11 where it voted to remove the red hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. more than a dozen people, including students and native american representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. they also sought some other compromise, the bulletin reported. at the wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray native americans in a negative stereotype.

dan balz: that-- that is such an interesting question because i think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on president trump in 2020, and i think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. we saw in iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for elizabeth warren. i think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. i think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like elizabeth warren or vice president biden, bernie sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. but there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. and my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.

according to beijing sources familiar with the chinese government information on wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the ccp leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. they are the communist youth league faction and the shanghai faction. they deserved to be the main powers since the youth league faction produced former president hu jintao and premier li keqiang, and the shanghai faction produced former president jiang zemin. their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. but now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. it's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. chinese vice chair li yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of hu jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.

the sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. never in american history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. the more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist joe alsop in 1957. when the kgb entrapped him having sex with another man in a moscow hotel room, alsop marched straight to the american embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across washington, alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the soviet regime.

fears about gay americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the cold war. previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. in 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, roscoe hillenkoetter, the first director of the central intelligence agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. nonetheless, hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.

immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.

diamond: i think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and i think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. we are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the united states. if there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.

— in a report exploring jpmorgan chase's relationship with amazon, the wall street journal's emily glazer, laura stevens and annamaria andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that amazon founder and chief executive jeffrey p. bezos established at the online retail giant. mr. bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and faqs, according to the journal. over roughly the past 18 months, jpmorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under gordon smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [jpmorgan] employees said. jpmorgan has also embraced bezos's customer obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the journal.

a related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. it should be evident to any observer of life in the u.s. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.

it is true that president ronald reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. but his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law congress had already passed. his exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, president george h. w. bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by congress. the point is instructive. the actions by reagan and bush are not a supporting precedent for mr. obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.

wonder woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as diana prince (gal gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. but while it's a pretty bad dc comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes dc comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid washington, d.c. movie. given hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see ww84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the district and its residents can be.

at&t, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, directv or u-verse. it doesn't matter if you already have at&t cellular service but not tv, or vice versa. you just need to end up with both phone and tv service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. this might not make sense if you already get your tv service through a company such as comcast or verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to tv. note that directv now, at&t's online streaming tv service, doesn't count toward this program. so if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck.

however, there is no reason to expect that the dynamics of labor markets will preserve equal opportunity over time in the face of educational and economic growth and innovation. the evolution of the kinds of occupations for which individuals compete will alter the structure of opportunity in such a way that it is not even possible to conceptualize equality of opportunity to live well over time in the way we understand equal opportunity employment. comparing the opportunities of individuals of different generations, they do not compete for the same occupations and on the same terms on which their parents or grandparents did. nor is there any guarantee that the institutional influences on the choices individuals and institutions make would be conducive to protecting the natural systems on which all human opportunity ultimately depends.

before he retired, then-army chief of staff gen. ray odierno indicated that local school performance would be a factor in the placement of army units around the country. if state and local officials intend to keep military bases in their communities, odierno said in 2013, they better start paying attention to the schools that are outside and inside our installations. because as we evaluate and as we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria. he commissioned a study, highlighting which schools are successful — and which are not — to examine the quality of schools that serve the children of soldiers.

last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a michigan courtroom to describe how larry nassar altered their lives with his abuse. they were heard and heeded. the judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. and their abuse, it seems, counts for little.

now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, obama is twisting the law, ignoring the constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. for years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, i'm president, i'm not king. apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. in truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.

montpelier: the number of fatalities on vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. vermont state police and the vermont agency of transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the times argus reported. but state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. lt. tara thomas, commander of safety programs for the vermont state police, said the reduction was unexplainable. thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. we wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. that's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. we're averaging just way too many each month, she said. the 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. the figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

cities, states, localities in the united states do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. and some in california have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. california governor gavin newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. so if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.
feilhaber continued: if you ask me it can't possibly be based on on-field performances. there are plenty of guys in mls that have had better seasons than other guys, in mls or other countries, that are getting opportunities for the national team.
where did the former yahoo us:aaba ceo first learn the value of hard work? it wasn't as a coder, product manager or vp for google goog, -2.62% —but at the county market in wausau, wisconsin, where she worked as a grocery store clerk at 16.

heath garrett, a campaign manager for former georgia republican sen. johnny isakson, told cnn that trump's attacks on gov. brian kemp and raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base republicans to go vote, and said they've threw perdue and loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.

senator lindsey graham: i am here to tell you--
like other coronavirus strains, the wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.
the committee typically does not reveal much publicly about its staff; it is withholding names and most details about potential new hires as some of them progress through a lengthy security clearance process.
we'll say 'drug overdose' or 'drug intoxication,' and then we identify the drugs, she said. so if it's five drugs that have caused or contributed to the death, then we put those five drugs down.
libertarian party candidates gary johnson and bill weld pitched themselves as the antidote to washington partisanship in a cnn town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the republican and the democratic presidential nominees.
aside from the inherent physical and political risks of putting a large number of u.s. troops on the ground inside syria, the u.s. worries about potential conflicts with russia, which is also conducting an aerial bombing campaign over syria.
in protest of the legislation, major sites like wikipedia and reddit participated in a 24-hour internet blackout on wednesday, while other sites like google took less drastic steps to signify their opposition to the legislation. the protests inspired voters to deluge their congressmen with phone calls and emails in protest of the bills as well, and by wednesday afternoon, several congressmen either came out in opposition to the bills or said congress should take more time to reconsider them. it seemed unlikely pipa would find the 60 votes necessary to pass tuesday's test vote in the senate.
boston: the city council swore in the most diverse group in its history monday. the council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by mayor martin walsh during a ceremony at faneuil hall, the boston herald reports. the mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. voters in november also elected the council's first latina member, julian mejia, as well as district councilors ricardo arroyo, kenzie bok and liz breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. city councilor kim janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. the council was a white male bastion for decades, but boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.
the centers for disease control and prevention has said for months that wearing masks slows the spread of covid-19, but meanwhile, some politicians, including president donald trump, have been called out for not wearing one. as the nation edged further into the stay-at-home era, viral videos of conflicts over mask requirements at businesses have become common to see.
it sounds to me like a sensible division of labor over four subcommittees and i don't think the agencies will feel like they're overlooked, said michael allen, a former majority staff director under republican chairman mike rogers, r-mich.
the vast majority of survey respondents — 90 percent — reported having spent more than five years in the military. they have years of experience and expertise that our armed forces can ill-afford to lose.
while mr. warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first democrat to be elected to the senate from georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved ossoff-perdue race and its implications for the next two years in american politics. whichever party wins that race will control the senate, with republicans counting on mr. perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain mr. biden's policy ambitions.
the pay-go principle, ocasio-cortez charged in a tweet wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.
hungarian prime minister viktor orbán said thursday that french president emmanuel macron is the champion of europe's pro-immigration forces and therefore he has a duty to oppose him.
frederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming biden administration. among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing oakland's case against five oil giants, including shell, to move forward in the california courts were vice president-elect kamala harris; biden's secretary of state pick, antony blinken; his future climate diplomat, john kerry; his choice for climate czar, gina mccarthy; and xavier becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.
a year ago, republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.
margaret brennan: new york democrat alexandria ocasio-cortez has made a name for herself taking on republicans in her own party. tonight, she sits down with 60 minutes. here's part of her interview.
if trump talked to more federal employees, he would hear stories from people like katherine scheflen, a lawyer in the justice department's civil rights division. she needs her check on time. i am a single mother of two disabled children. i live paycheck to paycheck, as do many americans, she said. it is not complicated — if i miss a paycheck, i cannot pay my mortgage and my other bills. it is as simple as that.
before that, two senate runoffs in georgia tuesday will decide whether democrats can achieve a 50-50 split in the chamber. if so, biden's party will have the advantage of vice president-to-be kamala harris's tie-breaking vote. but a thin republican majority would create huge friction on biden's administration, complicating efforts to confirm cabinet nominees, secure a new stimulus plan and money to fix a botched vaccine rollout, and to advance big goals in climate policy, health care and rebuilding us infrastructure.

democratic state sen. jessica ramos, a newly elected legislator from queens, vowed to co-sponsor the ccpa and consider other ways to provide state-level support to constantinides' legislation.
ready your tractors and plows—the farm bill is upon us. this omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 farm bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the u.s.
it's pretty easy for a ceo to say, 'these are my values. you violated them.' but the ceos who are smart know, 'once i back out of that opportunity to shape policy, the voice that i could have had is now lost,'  he added.

it is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like uber and lyft, which happen to be its competitors. in november, for instance, two women sued uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in florida and california. and last month an uber driver in beirut, lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of rebecca dykes, a british diplomat.
denver: wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. the colorado parks and wildlife department announced the discoveries wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, the denver post reported. the news was first reported tuesday by the craig press. the hunters provided a video shot in october of two wolves shown near the wyoming and utah borders, officials said. it was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in colorado, officials said. the announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. the ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western colorado, officials said. state wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.
the ban actually raised dicarlo's profile and, while not necessarily the route she would have chosen, has been good for business. she pre-sold more than 10,000 osé units in december (at $290 each), and has tripled the size of the company. at ces 2020, dicarlo's company will unveil two new bio-mimetic pleasure devices under the names baci and onda.
likewise, pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. in 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as house speaker. she will have served as the top democrat in the house for 19 years. if a democrat is elected president in 2020, pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. and if the republican experience provides any guidance, democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.
and democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. that would mean getting 10 republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.

add this to the list of the many mistakes the governor has made over the last 10 months, but won't answer for. he seemed to escape widespread criticism of his lethal executive order in march and the thousands of seniors who subsequently died. but maybe now people are taking notice:
state agencies are already making a push. last june, new york's department of public service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. in december, the state's public service commission released a plan requiring utilities such as conedison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. the new york state energy research and development authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.

outstanding student loan debt has reached a staggering $1.2 trillion, with over 70 percent of ba degree graduates borrowing to pay for college. some 21 million students now each owe an average of $29,400. what's worse, students have rack up all that debt even for jobs that pay $10 an hour. good luck working that off.
rep. mark meadows (r-nc), as well as sen. lindsey graham (r-sc), and democrats such as rep. jackie speier (d-ca) and debbie dingell (d-mi) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.
it is a testament to president trump's iconoclasm and common sense that he has embraced reality after so many years of fantasy presidencies.
my challenge today is not about the good people of arizona — [gavel banging] and it will stand in recess until the call of the chair. we'll pause. protesters are in the building. thank you. it wasn't anything you said. [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] on loudspeaker: all individuals must leave the u.s. capitol grounds. the senate will come to order. today was a dark day in the history of the united states capitol. as congress met to certify the election results, president trump held a simultaneous rally. watch these moments unfold side by side to see how his speech incited a mob that broke into the capitol. credit credit... erin schaff/the new york times

according to the biography the snowball: warren buffett and the business of life, he brainstormed strategies to deliver his papers as fast as possible, sold calendars and magazine subscriptions on the side and took in $2,000 in two years. at 15, he hammered out a profit-share agreement with a farmer in nebraska and invested $1,200 of those earnings in a 40-acre farm. so, uh, not exactly your average teen.

three defense department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the memo publicly, said the pentagon is trying to balance national security concerns with the military's needs for specialized skills immigrants can provide. in some cases, the officials said, the army wasn't using the program as intended, putting mavni recruits in roles that didn't match their skills.
representatives from bju press and abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. however, a 2017 huffpost investigation found that about one-third of christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called accelerated christian education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. the number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)
bloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under president barack obama. that would bring the highest income tax rate under bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. that's still less than sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.
if he decides to run again, bernie would have to have a campaign structure which is much more robust with a much bigger leadership team, weaver, slated to become a senior strategic adviser if sanders runs, said on wednesday. it would have to be much more diverse than was the case in 2016, when it was too male and too white.

lindsay p. cohn, a professor of political science at the naval war college, said that mr. trump appears to be convinced that general suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the middle east. it satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.
the disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. that wouldn't be cheap. and many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of their wealth overseas.
on the subject of foreign policy, johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.
president-elect joe biden has unveiled an economic relief plan that would deliver $1,400 to most americans and invest in a national vaccination program — and also endorses a whole host of democratic policy priorities from increasing the minimum wage and expanding paid leave to extending unemployment benefits.
the afghan war has not been a major focus for new house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), and it is not clear whether she has much appetite for a major debate on the u.s. commitment there.
the atlanta journal-constitution reported lawson was also involved in an incident last summer in which he followed county commissioner lisa cupid, which led the african american commissioner to accuse him of racial profiling. lawson was cleared of wrong-doing in the cupid case.

the best thing we were able to do in the bubble is we were able to stand together in strength and numbers with everything that was going on in america and everything that was going wrong in america, james said. we were able to voice those opinions and voice those facts every single day. i hope to continue that now being outside the bubble.
in another sign investors are seeking refuge from market volatility, the price of 10-year treasury notes surged, pushing the yield to below 1% — the first time that has ever happened, according to bloomberg. the fed said in a statement that while the u.s. economy remains strong, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.

inskeep: you're exactly correct that mcconnell did not give in to it yesterday, but i do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. mitch mcconnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. he did not always support the president. on a number of occasions, he criticized the president. but there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. should he have said more sooner?
the bill, announced tuesday and set to be introduced wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. six cities across the united states already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. the city council in washington, d.c., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. but it would be a historic first for a metropolis like new york to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.

i'm proud of her for choosing storm lake, said sean bagniewski, the chair of the polk county democratic party. it's one of the few iowa cities that's growing, and it's because it's been very welcoming to immigrants. it's known as a melting pot in rural iowa; i'd love to see more democrats heading there.
nothing in this election changed americans' fundamental rights, or their need for privacy, said matt wood, policy director for free press, an advocacy organization. the election only gave more power to the party that would seemingly rather side with comcast and other cable lobbyists than with their own constituents.
many traditional banks charge a maintenance, or service, fee on checking accounts -- about $10 to $12 per month.

the gadsden flag, which is known to many as the don't tread on me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the american revolution. the flag and symbol are also popular among libertarians. but it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.
sen. sanders: --whether conservative or progressive, is- i didn't say that. what i would say--
the message is very simple: this is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, new york democratic rep. nita lowey, who chairs the house appropriations committee, said afterward.
barnes mentioned a two-tiered regimen of testing 72 hours before departure and again upon arrival as one possible standard, and she cited a testing pilot program in hawaii -- where a 10-day quarantine can be bypassed on most islands with negative test results -- as an example of where testing out of quarantine has generated demand.
edward hugler, the deputy assistant secretary for operations at the department of labor and a veteran of presidential transitions, advises that managers who confer with the transition landing teams should anticipate and be prepared to give them what they need without trying to provide every detail of the department or agency handbook. more often than not, he added, they will tell you what they want.

the lyft bonus category means you'll earn an impressive 10 points for every dollar you spend on the ride-sharing service, but it won't be of any use to most people who aren't currently using lyft. the same goes for the added doordash annual credit and free dashpass membership, which are only valuable to folks who order food for delivery and have doordash service in their area.
i'm afraid that she didn't say very much. she was very hopeful. her attitude was one of hope that the human rights council would do a better job going forward, bayefsky said of haley's remarks.
that's a good question, bayefsky replied. first of, they didn't 'rejoin' because president bush had never joined. it was created in 2006. obama, it was one of his very first foreign policy moves to join it, to lend it credibility. he left president trump holding the bag because he ran the united states for a three-year term that began only on january 1, 2017, hoping to essentially rule from the grave. so they were faced with an issue of whether to get off it from the get-go at the trump administration, and they didn't.
and that leads to the second thing you'll need to do, which is start cutting expenses if your current budget doesn't allow you to save at least 10% of your paycheck month after month. whether you choose to reduce one major expense, like your home, or a series of smaller ones, like your cable bill and takeout habit, is up to you. but you will need to lower your spending if you're tired of the paycheck to paycheck routine.
any effort to reform iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. funding a proxy war in yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in lebanon, and seeking to dominate syria and iraq cost billions of dollars annually.
in 1948, time magazine journalist whittaker chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that alger hiss, a former state department official, was a member of his cell. while chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.
then there were two reports of domestic incidents involving seidle in january and february that year, according to the prosecutor's report. tinton falls police responded to a confrontation between seidle and one of chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. seidle provided the press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that seidle put his hands on her.

as unemployment around the u.s. was peaking this spring, more than a quarter of young americans lost their jobs. most of the country's youngest workers have either lost a job or taken a pay cut during the crash, according to pew research — and perhaps not surprisingly, they are also the most likely to report having trouble paying their bills or rent.
dr. alondra nelson of the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, who mr. biden has picked to be deputy science policy chief, also emphasized the importance in expanding opportunities in the stem fields. as a black woman researcher, i am keenly aware of who is missing from these rooms, nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, said of her career.
at monson's urging, mormons were vigorous campaign donors and volunteers in support of a measure to ban gay marriage in california in 2008. that prompted a backlash against the church that included vandalism of church buildings, protest marches and demonstrations outside church temples nationwide.

at time point, assuming the economic expansion continues, businesses will be forced to choose between continuing to forgo new hires (and limiting their ability to grow) or getting into a bidding war for the best workers by paying more. the latter would lead to the much-delayed, long-heralded boost to wage inflation -- and would deliver a much-needed salve to middle-class incomes.

since the cold war, both the us and russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. this nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. but this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.

the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, hasn't budged since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was passed in 1938. according to the u.s. department of labor, as of 2019 (the latest year for which data is available) 392,000 american workers were earning $7.25 an hour; another 1.2 million earned even less (tipped workers are among those exempt from the $7.25 minimum.)

sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, seidle wrote. i would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. so where was the healing to take place? tell me? every day i missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. there was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that i missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. my children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' not because i left, but for her malice.

but the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond america's shores. like sanders and warren, gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. what she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.

mark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.

jackson: foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in grand teton national park. park officials closed a large area of the teton range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. grand teton spokeswoman denise germann said another attempt could take place in late january or early february. mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. the national park service has contracted oregon-based baker aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the jackson hole news & guide reported. wintry weather kept baker from making it to the area, germann said. park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

surely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said jesse bragg, the media director at the boston-based anti-corruption group corporate accountability. experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.

but that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.
for one thing, the case is a thinly disguised attempt by conservatives to weaken public employee unions, which tend to overwhelmingly support democrats.
they think of when they had black lives matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. people are literally storming the capitol and nothing is happening to them, althimer told huffpost. one of my students said, 'if 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' i said, 'no, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'
before president trump begged russia and china, as well as ukraine, for electoral help, the norms against such behavior were so strong that no candidate would have dreamed of making such requests.
federal regulators have interpreted a 1986 access-to-travel law to allow support animals in airplane cabins and in apartment buildings that do not allow pets. but some people use untrained pets in order to get them on a plane for free, especially since it's easy to go online to buy vests or id card with a service animal insignia.

cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.
diamond: as one official has said, terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? the trump administration and health officials knew back in january that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. they knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. but across the month of february, as my colleague david lim at politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. they were coming back with errors.

biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.

the federal charges and ongoing investigations are likely to further erode public trust in police and again raise concerns about oversight and accountability, especially in the wake of 2020's nationwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice following the killings of black men and women by police officers.
johnson depended on humphrey to serve as his point of communication with younger democrats who wanted the party to deal with issues like civil rights, health care and urban renewal. humphrey was willing to work with johnson — who many younger liberals didn't trust — because he made sure their concerns were being heard by the leadership. the relationship paved a path to the great democratic landslide of 1964, the passage of civil rights legislation and the great society social innovations.

nashua: three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an amazon warehouse, fire officials said thursday. firefighters in nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, deputy fire chief karl gerhard told wmur-tv. the major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, gerhard said. there was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. the building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. two were treated and released. a fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. osha and the state fire marshal's office were notified.

we should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. xi's long-time speechwriter li shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. the appointment shows that the chinese president is seeking to train li to be secretary wang qishan's successor.
trump has complained that he endorsed romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for senate and that romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the senate in early 2019. trump met with romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.

gross: trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. he didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. it would look bad; it would make him look bad. so what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?

when the senate exonerated trump, they made it more likely that he and potentially, future presidents would ignore the norms that enable our democracy to function. and what was the result? more of the same, but worse. this time the president incited political violence, leading to homicide.
a rioter inside the capitol wore a camp auschwitz sweatshirt. the bottom of the shirt reads work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words arbeit macht frei on the gates of the nazi concentration camp. auschwitz was the largest and most infamous nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during world war ii.

that particular phrase chaffed him. the term is unnecessary, seidle wrote. it feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.
what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.
biden is expected to reverse some of trump's restrictive asylum measures, including the remain in mexico policy, but recently said his administration would need probably the next six months to re-create a system that can process asylum-seekers to prevent a flood of migrants arriving at the southern border.

fortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the u.s. senate stand on allowing carol browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. sen. david vitter of louisiana has introduced an amendment (sa 2440) to the department of the interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for browner's policy directives. any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just carol browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.
what's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the sanders institute, founded by the senator's wife, jane sanders, and frequently posturing as the democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed trump's strike against assad in 2017.

like other chinese provincial leaders, mr. luo has had some dealings with hong kong, especially over investment and business. he held talks with his predecessor, mr. wang, at least once, leading a delegation from shanxi province to hong kong in late 2018. on that visit, mr. luo also met the city's chief executive, carrie lam, to discuss investment opportunities. but he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in hong kong.
d.c., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of dupont circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the uptown theater in cleveland park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of eighth street nw in penn quarter. (the closure of 18th street nw in adams morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. it was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.

the guidelines require that host organizations, who in this case include the former boy scouts of america (now scouts bsa), … ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and ist [staff] at a number of locations on the site. heads of contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their participants, unit leaders, contingent staff, and ist in an appropriate way. (see guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) stunningly, the world jamboree guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event.

gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.
the phrase jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar walter russell mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides american foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: hamiltonian, wilsonian, jacksonian and jeffersonian. the worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, american foreign policy tends to work.

the facts on the ground suggest the timetable will be rather open-ended. the diplomatic wrangling with turkey — which has vowed a military operation against kurdish units across its southern border — may prove to be deeply complicated. a security guarantee for the syrian kurds could just be a new unobtainable condition, tweeted faysal itani of the atlantic council. seeing their options dwindling, the main syrian kurdish armed faction has opened talks with the assad regime, requesting military support from damascus against a potential turkish offensive.

fed loan program for midsize firms had few takers: washington was happy to rely on the fed because it had the chops to get a program for medium-size businesses up and running fast. its apolitical reputation reduced concern about loans being steered to big donors. the treasury department became a fed partner to absorb any loan losses, the wall street journal's nick timiraos reports.

jonathan bernstein, bloomberg: what president donald trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist dave hopkins points out, following the lead of the house freedom caucus. but freedom caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. what they care about is proving that they're true conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream republicans. in practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. that's this shutdown in a nutshell. instead of making a deal last year, when republicans held unified control of government, trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as democrats take over the house majority.

as a women's march leader, i remember during the [brett] kavanaugh hearing i was the first protester in that senate chamber, and all i did was get up and say, this is a travesty of justice. this is a mockery of justice. that's all i did. and i was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the capitol police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. i did not engage in violence. i did not have any weapons. i was an unarmed woman just saying that i was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and i was brutalized by the capitol police.
contrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.
liasson: well, what i make of it is there's not only a big breach between trump and the intelligence community. there's also a breach between trump and a bipartisan group of senators on capitol hill who say there should be hearings. there was the initial reaction from some republicans where they didn't want to undermine trump's victory, but other republicans want to get to the bottom of this. they consider this a cyberattack. they don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. we also have the report that the obama administration has asked for to be completed before obama leaves office. that means it would probably come out right before trump's inauguration.

montgomery: a judge on tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the alabama democratic party. montgomery circuit judge greg griffin scheduled the hearing for jan. 30. the hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. longtime state party leader nancy worley had filed the lawsuit to block state rep. chris england from taking control as party chair. a revamped governing board of the party elected england as chair this fall, but worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. the ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as worley and joe reed, against an upstart faction. the democratic national committee supports england and recognizes him as state chair. barry ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in worley's suit, said last month that england is functioning as party chair.

in the last congress, my colleagues pete aguilar of california, a democrat, and will hurd of texas, a republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. it would have directed homeland security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer congress a strategy for each section of the border. it might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in san diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. it might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. it might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. but if homeland security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.

jennings: well, you're right. they don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. but he ought to. in my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing daca. fixing daca was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. it's something he has endorsed before. that would give pause, i think, to this democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. a lot of these new members of congress ran on a fix for daca. i think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for daca. that's a win for everybody...

this commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis. it's far outside the political mainstream and would have presented serious problems for centrist democrats facing a confirmation vote.
in 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

while the capitol building has been ransacked, left undiscussed is the fact that we just marked the deadliest day of the covid-19 pandemic -- adding to the more than 350,000 americans who have died because of trump's denialism and misrule. this is also a mark of trump's american carnage. he is unable to discharge the duties of the presidency without always thinking about himself first. that's why he couldn't bring himself to clearly and immediately condemn this violence. no wonder there are renewed calls -- even from some conservatives like john podhoretz at commentary -- to impeach and remove president trump from office. there is certainly cause even if there is not time.

johnson: well, first of all, i think the president will. he's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. and from my standpoint, i think one of the things republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. you know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. we should be preparing, and i'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that i'm a co-sponsor of to fund the coast guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. hopefully, mitch mcconnell will bring it up on the floor of the senate. i don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. and of course, nancy pelosi was very clear in the white house yesterday that when president trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? you know, will i get my barrier funding? and she said no. and so again, the democrats are being hypocritical. they're paying lip service to border security. barriers actually work. they absolutely do. we need them. it's kind of a first step table stakes issue. but they're playing politics. and i hope the president stands strong.
senior pentagon officials said that mr. miller assessed that dispatching the nimitz now, before the first anniversary this sunday of general suleimani's death in an american drone strike in iraq, could remove what iranian hard-liners see as a provocation that justifies their threats against american military targets. some analysts said the return of the nimitz to its home port of bremerton, wash., was a welcome reduction in tensions between the two countries.

first, vice president pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke section 4 of the 25th amendment in order to make a declaration that mr. trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. this would immediately suspend, but not remove, mr. trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint mr. pence as acting president. the 25th amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.

all of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the federal reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. there is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. first, credit is already cheap. but more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.

and it connects seamlessly to another trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly muslims. gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from iraq and syria to enter the u.s., courted indian prime minister narendra modi, despite his links to anti-muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a fox news darling for her willingness to claim president barack obama was making americans less safe by supporting arab rebels in syria and not using the phrase radical islam. (obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; gabbard and trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the islamic state.)

in the u.s., september, october and especially early november are very cheap; early december is a bargain travel period, too. europe flights are generally cheap from late september to mid-december. don't fly: the days immediately surrounding major holidays, especially thanksgiving (nov. 28); this is almost always the most expensive time of the year to fly within the u.s.
tip: spring is cheaper than summer, so if you can fly before june, do so.
of course not. flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. it never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. there's a long history of racism in flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.
the report starts with this warning:
after a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. but a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. in fact, nearly half of u.s. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the economic policy institute. and that's a problem, because social security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. neither is ideal.
the trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change denman's proposal. it went from calling on the u.s. to provide ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.
there were just two words i uttered after job offers early in my career: thank you.
now, there are also new things. japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when president trump would like to build more infrastructure in the u.s. and also remember that in 2011 following the fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, japan shut down its nuclear plants. so now japan is a very good market for u.s. exports of oil and natural gas.

democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg says he would pay more to uncle sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans. what the former new york city mayor hasn't said: he'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.

grace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. mr. ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. he continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life.

in 2007, adelson launched israel today, a free daily that has become israel's largest circulation newspaper. it features cheerleading coverage of netanyahu and his family, a key asset in netanyahu's longtime quest for positive press coverage in israel. when netanyahu addressed a joint session of congress in 2015 against the iran nuclear deal, adelson was in the gallery.

trump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. his policy is not america first — as in america leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. rather it is, russia first as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. if ronald reagan's response when asked how the cold war would end was, we win, they lose, trump's is: putin wins. let's bury our heads in the sand.

tuesday, january 26, 1999; page e1 intel corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. the turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott intel products in protest of the chip's id component. this is a significant victory for privacy, said barry steinhardt, associate director for the american civil liberties union, who praised intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. they did it on internet time. in announcing the id feature of the new pentium iii microprocessor last week, intel officials described it as an important step for internet security. the id number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. while each chip still will have a unique number, intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the id function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. chuck mulloy, a spokesman for the santa clara, calif., company, acknowledged that intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. we're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, mulloy said.

although burgess was openly gay and mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. nonetheless, pressure from the fbi over the burgess affair led the british government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the foreign service, and media portrayed martin and mitchell as lovers.

it is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the north korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. access to a high-level military official familiar with the north korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. in short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for pyongyang.

romney told the washington post that he asked the white house for more information about actions taken toward ukraine, particularly concerning acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, but none was provided. he wanted former national security adviser john bolton to testify, which he said could have potentially raised reasonable doubt that the president did anything wrong and lead him to vote to acquit. the senate rejected subpoenaing bolton.
the other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in u.s.-china relations is probably here to stay, as long as trump sticks around in the white house.
the electoral college vote told the story. lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the electoral college took most of the north, along with california and oregon. douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only missouri (and three votes in new jersey). breckinridge took most of the south, along with maryland and delaware, and bell's middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: tennessee, kentucky and virginia.

in 2015, president barack obama rejected keystone xl, saying that u.s. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. trump, in turn, revived both keystone xl and the dakota access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. legal challenges followed and in november 2018 a federal judge halted construction on keystone xl and ordered the trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company transcanada to again proceed with construction.

weidrich concedes that there's been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago. in addition to the falling unemployment rate (just 3% for people 55+), there are the rising stock market (until the past few days), increasing wages — up 2.9% in the past year — rising median net worth and a drop in the number of americans without health insurance (something which may change with the repeal of the affordable care act mandate).

what is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. we've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. i believe that the women's march ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the women's march ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. we cannot defeat donald trump or his policies in silos. once donald trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. so i think in the next four years, under the biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.

diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.

norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. it is sometimes said that norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. by choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.

as cabot noted on twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for tony romo to possibly join the texans. having lured osweiler away from the broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup tom savage, and the texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land romo.

senator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.

how mr. trump sees the killing of general suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on iran is unclear, and on friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the united states and iran do not spiral out of control. general suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in palm beach, fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.

one possible outcome is that a spooked iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the islamic republic's thinking, says the iranian-american journalist masih alinejad. for 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. it may now take its time to reassess that view.

the arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, sellian, and priya rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. grace nakamura, an adjudicator for the immigration and refugee board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, kumi. the latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. it's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: bala vilifies the canadian border services agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, stephen harper, and sings the praises of the canadian tamil congress, which appears here as the tamil alliance.

the only thing three successive administrations concerned themselves with regarding the palestinians generally, and the plo specifically, was whether or not they would say from time to time that they were willing to cut a deal – any deal – with israel.
the targeted killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an mq-9 reaper drone at baghdad international airport was an impressive display of american military prowess. and it liquidated a destabilizing figure: the general was the commander of the quds force, which is responsible for iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. in the scheme of things, he had it coming. yet killing him made little strategic sense for the united states. in some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of american foreign policymaking.

like many districts in new jersey, vineland hosts a transitional bilingual program for students who arrive with limited english skills. this year, about 800 students are enrolled. they learn their core academics in spanish – often right next door to classes where the same content is taught in english – but they have time built into the day for speaking, reading and writing in english.

if you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. if afghanistan brought down the soviet union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would russian president vladimir putin go back in?

president obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. article ii, section 3 requires that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. he cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. to infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. president obama admitted as much when he said, the fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that i have to enforce. he was specifically talking about immigration laws.

but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.

santa fe: the legislature's lead budget-writing committee on tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of new mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. the legislative finance committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins july 1. another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.

i believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, democrats will regain the house and senate. but you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, sanders said in an interview. if it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'it doesn't make a difference. why should i be involved?' 
so i feel proud. i hope that women, particularly those who were never really organizers and started becoming active in the last four years, i hope that they see the fruits of their labor. i hope that black and brown organizers who have been organizing for decades see the fruits of their labor. that's what i'm excited about.

the u.s. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. the tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.

st. louis: gov. mike parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. the st. louis post-dispatch reports that parson, the former polk county sheriff, said he is monitoring a platte county court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. the video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. but backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. the governor's stance is in contrast to the missouri state highway patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.

the alternative? iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like hezbollah for political deniability. it could try to take hostages at the american embassy in baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in tehran in 1979. it could use its influence in iraq to demand the expulsion of u.s. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as mark dubowitz of the foundation for defense of democracies observes. and it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.
the sept. 5, 1985 letter ― which has not previously been reported on ― came as sanders was considering a run for governor, and left-wing activists in the state and around the country were debating whether he should mount an independent bid or launch a primary challenge to the state's democratic governor, madeleine kunin.

jennings: yeah. i think senator romney, senator-elect romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. i recall back in the summer, he wrote in the salt lake tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. he said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. i think he's also doing what a lot of republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. and that is not something that is unique to mitt romney. a lot of republican voters did that when they voted for donald trump in 2016. so mitt romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. and i expect he'll keep doing that.

the story began to unravel as soon as it hit the street. apparently, the threat was so severe that it was worth killing soleimani and courting war with a country of 80 million people. it's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any u.s. embassies that they were in peril. national security adviser robert o'brien dodged the question when it was asked.

the u.s showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. america's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… almost all of the policy discourse in washington, d.c. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in american society. this kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

the washington post, editorial: in the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, president trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation's immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. they are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts.

this is of particular importance because signing a trade deal with the united states quickly after brexit appears to be a key lynchpin of the post-eu strategy, as an easy passage of that agreement would be a major signal to the rest of the world that the uk is emerging ready to trade, and easy to do business with. it also holds the european union's feet to the fire, as their anticipated prevarication over signing a deal with the uk would be shown up as a sham in the light of a quick deal with the u.s.

one-fifth of all global emissions, the world bank says, are now subject to a carbon price — either a tax or a market in mandatory pollution permits known as cap-and-trade. nevertheless, energy-related carbon emissions jumped 1.6 percent in 2017, according to the international energy agency, and they likely rose more in 2018.

at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.

before being sworn in at the interior department on aug. 1, 2017, bernhardt, a colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm brownstein hyatt farber schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. he also previously served as a top interior official under former president george w. bush, leading an attempt to open alaska's pristine arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas development.

topeka: democratic gov. laura kelly proposed monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the republican-controlled legislature spiked last year. kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. the move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. but it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. the kansas public employee retirement system projects kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, mr. trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas.
at the end of the 19th century, the supreme court declared that congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. derived from article 1, section 8 of the constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. as the high court observed, over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete.

there's 10 years of steady jobs for these people, not boom and bust the way it has been in the oil fields, horton said. and it's work that their skillset and identity is aligned with. plus, it leaves them in situ — they don't have to move, their kids stay in the same schools. ten years is a long time to transition, so it's really common sense convergence here. it's also worker solidarity, for these people in the fields not to feel like they're abandoned by society.
but there's less appetite for deep medicaid cuts in the senate and even less in the electorate. if ryan is serious about reforming medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. i partnered with a republican from the first bush administration, gail wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. it would be a smart move now.

by contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

and we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the u.s. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. so i think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.
that creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. high prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. the dip in u.s. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.

the industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between march and august 2020, according to the bureau of labor statistics and consulting firm deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said ken medlock, senior director of the center for energy studies at rice university's baker institute for public policy.

this is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the united kingdom, i've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. for those unfamiliar with the concept: you order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. when glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. repeat. no waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me.

romo, who graciously turned the quarterbacking reins over to rookie dak prescott in november, would surely be upset with such a hardball strategy by his longtime team. in addition, romo is close with jones, who may feel that, as matter of courtesy and respect, he owes it to the 36-year-old to simply release him and let him choose his own team. another possibility is that dallas hangs on to romo, as a valuable and well-paid insurance policy, but again, jones risks tension in his locker room.

so carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive. by providing the illusion that they're effectively dealing with climate change, they reduce pressure for tougher policies that could meaningfully curb emissions, such as phasing out coal as an electricity fuel except where it's paired with carbon-capture technology; maintaining existing nuclear plants; and making renewable energy cheaper.

many large companies have faced criticism over how they have treated their employees throughout the pandemic, from shoddy sick leave policies to poor working conditions. companies, ranging from meatpacking plants to amazon, have grappled with worker absences and outbreaks that have forced temporary shutdowns of their factories and warehouses. there is also a looming debate in congress over whether employers should be exempt from legal liabilities related to coronavirus exposure, as more begin to recall their employees back to offices and other work sites.
california voters repealed the state's ban on bilingual education in 2016. massachusetts overturned its english-only instruction law in 2017. arizona officials, many of whom fought fervently for years to keep spanish instruction out of public schools, are watering down its law, in part because outcomes for english learners there have been dismal.

the annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. it would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.

congress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the affordable care act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. one priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help. another is rewriting formulas to peg the size of the subsidy to a more generous health insurance plan, a way to increase the amount of assistance.
a source close to the yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster that former vice president joe biden's campaign reached out about a deal. the rules of the iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. i frankly think i'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, yang said. in waukee today, biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former iowa governor tom vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to o'keefe.

mexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for july 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. the mexican government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. president enrique pena nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the september 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential us policy shifts ahead of the elections. in recent years, mexican us-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.

the huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything boris johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. it's also a betrayal of the very thing on which boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful brexit. one of the key elements in boris's vision of a bright, post-brexit future for britain outside the european union is international trade: all those incredible deals britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by eu regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by president trump with the u.s. but trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the huawei deal. if you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the remain-biased civil service — led by arch-remainer mark sedwill — is using the huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage boris's post-brexit deals in order to make the brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the eu more likely. you would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. we have scotched the remainer snake but we have not killed it. no doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.

at the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.

analyst disillusioned with journalism and 'trump circus': longtime military analyst william arkin has stepped down from his role at nbc news with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as president donald trump ... arkin, a u.s. army veteran who has worked for nbc as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by cnn on wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis. my expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. and i find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the trump circus, arkin wrote. - reported by joseph a. wulfsohn

congress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. the upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. industry groups are already on board—the food marketing institute and grocery manufacturers association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.
senator lindsey graham: yeah. but what he's not open to is a lecture by the speaker of the house. i'll give you a dollar. he's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being gestapo agents gassing children. he's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. so if you bring dick durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.

in a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. in pennsylvania, ap test results can count toward a school's ranking. many states are now moving toward using sat's as the bs test for high school ranking. consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (will the ap credit be any use to her at her chosen school? does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. this spring, somewhere in america, a high school principal is going to say, i don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at pat's school in pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. you get pat in there to take that damn ap test, whether pat wants to or not.

pence diminished - the atlantic: according to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as trump's friction with congress has increased, pence's clout has suffered. two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that pence was leading the trump administration's negotiations on border security. yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending pence to a meeting that trump himself said would yield nothing. this, coupled with the moments over the past month when trump has publicly undermined pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.
roberts, 82, maneuvered the 2018 farm bill through congress with support from both parties — a move ultimately embraced by president donald trump as a rare bipartisan success. however, some republican critics argue roberts' work across the aisle resulted in a deeply flawed and costly farm bill that represents a betrayal of conservative values. it's a slap in the face to ronald reagan, said robert rector, senior research fellow at the heritage foundation. it's a victory for a massive welfare state without work requirements and an out-of-control budget.

that's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. a year later, assad's army launched a chemical attack on a damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] in response, the u.s. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. but a new threat was also emerging — isis. in 2014, the u.s. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. these efforts expanded and the u.s. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. in 2016, u.s.-supported fighters took control of the isis stronghold of manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, raqqa. there are now around 2,000 american forces in syria who are largely fighting alongside the kurdish groups. this has been a problem for america's ally turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the kurds. u.s. troops have had run-ins with assad's forces as well as groups backed by russia and iran. since taking office, trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. we are prepared to sustain this response, until the syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. u.s. officials and allies dispute the claim that isis has been defeated. they warn that an american departure will weaken u.s. influence in the region and may embolden russia, iran and turkey, who are also on the ground. the other worry?

what sets trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the ukraine aid was not in accordance with official us policy toward ukraine. defense secretary mark esper and secretary of state mike pompeo, along with then-national security adviser john bolton, all lobbied trump to release the aid before he relented in september. additionally, the nonpartisan government accountability office determined trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.
dennis shaul, the ceo of the community financial services association of america, a trade group that includes payday lenders, said he was pleased. the bureau's rule was crafted on a pre-determined, partisan agenda that failed to demonstrate consumer harm from small-dollar loans, ignored unbiased research and data, and relied on flawed information to support its rulemaking, he said.
diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.

as with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. another important answer to get on paper: what counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. if you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as gemsafe.
borrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. when they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. if the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. in that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.

trenton: the state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. the measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. the bill was approved by two assembly committees monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. to achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. at the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.

to that end, writers patty jenkins (who also directed) and geoff johns introduce maxwell lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. where previous entries in the dc expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and wonder woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane you can't always get what you want or be careful what you wish for.
nonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. the afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. even more to the point for americans, the united states has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within afghan borders. the united states probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.

it cleveland doesn't turn around and trade osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. that may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what nba teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the nfl, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. in any event, if it helps land the highly regarded garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.

providence: legislative leaders said wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. a provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. democratic gov. gina raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. democratic house speaker nicholas mattiello and senate president dominick ruggerio said wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. however, they still took issue with how the department of business regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. the legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

i am glad trump brought up the end of the soviet union, however. the u.s.s.r. didn't magically change its name; the west won the cold war (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). putin views the fall of the soviet union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing russia as a great power, which trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing syria to russia and its ally iran.

mark landler: --with his own president. president trump just a few minutes ago on his way to camp david repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of syria soon. that's a very different message than what john bolton had in israel a few hours earlier. some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the turks would go after our kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, i think a lot of people in the pentagon are skeptical the turks can ever be relied on not to go after the kurds. so i think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. but i have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from president trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. he will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--

third, the process is mired in bureaucracy. the disinterments jpac does approve must go through additional government layers to the defense pow/missing personnel office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the army for final approval. while these steps tend to be a rubber stamp — the army has never turned jpac down — dna can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.

spring hill:general motors and united auto workers local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective feb. 3. the decision resolves a dispute between gm in spring hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, chairman mike herron told the daily herald on thursday. under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in october, gm agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. none of the temporary workers in spring hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. the deal between gm and local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. the company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. on monday, gm announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 uaw-represented plants across the country. ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. at gm's flint assembly in michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

mr. trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.

hancock county: a huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a new orleans spacecraft factory on wednesday to a barge that will float it up the mississippi river for testing. the recently completed core stage of nasa's space launch system, which dwarfed the hundreds of nasa and boeing employees, was to be taken to the stennis space center in hancock county, about 50 miles northeast of new orleans. space launch system rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of nasa's artemis program. the core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant carnival float from the michoud assembly center in eastern new orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. it will undergo tests at stennis ahead of the first artemis launch, planned for 2021, said tony castilleja, a systems engineer with the boeing space team. the sls core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage nasa has assembled since the apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the moon. it will be used for artemis i, a test-flight without a crew. artemis ii is to send up a crewed spacecraft. the third mission, artemis iii, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to mars.

dallas: a contempt of court charge has been dropped against the dallas county district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against dallas county district attorney john creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer amber guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by judge tammy kemp. the white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, botham jean, inside his own apartment. kemp said in an order that the interview, in which creuzot explained why he thought guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.

the obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to iran's deal-breaking behavior. in october iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 iran's president hassan rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous u.n. security council resolutions. none of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. however, the white house chose to delay punishing iran for these violations, though reuters reported that spokesman josh earnest said president obama would not stand in the way if u.s. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit u.s. national security. this frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells tehran that anything goes.

but after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to iowa, the stakes for warren are high. this is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. warren's first event on saturday is at one of sioux city's largest arts venues, one that clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another democrat who may run for president.

first, iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with russian president vladimir putin.

new orleans: john white, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as louisiana's education superintendent. he told state board of elementary and secondary education members in a letter that he will leave the job march 11. he did not state his reasons. the board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. white can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. his tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and gov. john bel edwards. and the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of white. although he didn't discuss his future, the advocate reported in april that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, propel america, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. white has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state board of elementary and secondary education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.

an even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. this means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. in addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.

diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.

sen. sanders: well, two points. i'm a member of the democratic leadership. i've been in the democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of vermont, where i live, i am supported by democrats and have won the democratic primary. but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to democrats, and to more than a few republicans. look, we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america. all over this country, margaret, and i have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. they can't afford childcare. they can't afford healthcare. they're scared to death about their retirement. they want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. that's how you win. you put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. that is what we're doing. no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. that's how you beat trump.

donald trump's legacy is american carnage. our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. his misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. his rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently. now we are all reaping what they've sown, as the president watches it all burn from within the white house. but then, there are some men who want to ruin if they cannot rule.

what could be better: unless you're going to take advantage of capital one's transfer partners, you'd be better off with our benchmark citi double cash card over the ventureone. that's because you're only earning 1.25 miles per dollar with the capital one ventureone, and you only get 1 cent per mile when redeeming them using the purchase eraser, meaning you're effectively getting a return of 1.25 cents per dollar spent, while the citi double cash earns 2 cents per dollar spent.

portland: the state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. patrick keliher, commissioner of the maine department of marine resources, told maine public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. that would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. the season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but maine's lobstermen finished strong, keliher said. the price for maine lobster was also strong, he said. it's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. the biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

in fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though i had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and i've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). one tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. so districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school k-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.

dan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.

and a wealth tax may not even be legal. the ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the u.s. constitution. legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. the debate, josh barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.

seattle: mayor jenny durkan said seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. durkan included those directives in a green new deal executive order wednesday. neither the new keyarena now under construction at seattle center nor the massive seattle aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, durkan said. that's because the projects are underway, she said. both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. the $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, durkan's office said. there's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. last year, the council passed a green new deal resolution that said seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

president obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

senator dick durbin: they did not cross the border. the solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. and this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.

needless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.

what we like about the chase sapphire preferred: it may not seem like it, but at over 10 years old, the chase sapphire preferred is practically the granddaddy of travel credit cards. with classic travel and dining bonus categories, 5 points per dollar on lyft rides and a 60,000-point sign-up bonus, it should be easy to quickly score plenty of points, especially since most food delivery services will code as dining on the csp and earn 2 points per dollar.

those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.

after no georgia senate candidate received 50% of the vote in november, the races turned to two runoffs. while ossoff and warnock ran on a unity ticket, trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the republican party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.
mr. warnock and mr. ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. republicans used much of the runoff to focus on mr. warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize african-american voters, especially in more conservative rural georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.

klon kitchen of the heritage foundation said of china's previous bad-faith behaviour on leveraging their tech equipment installed in foreign nations: china has already shown it's perfectly willing and able to exploit others in this way, having siphoned data from the african union headquarters in ethiopia, over networks its state-owned companies constructed earlier this decade. recent history and common sense are united: it would be utterly foolish for britain to give china similar access.

something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. in the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. a modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. an advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.

johnson: well, again, i want to maintain pressure, because i actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. you know, hugh, we do have a crisis. you know, it drives me crazy how democrats are minimizing this problem. you know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? everybody recognized it. the obama administration responded to it. the cbp was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. about 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. in the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. you know, we have the flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. and once they get here, they are home free. and when i hear democrats talk about technology on the border, i mean, that's fine. we can track somebody, we can apprehend them. we process them. and then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. that's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally and hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, i think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted.

this strikes me as a typical trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of afghanistan, says former ambassador to turkey, eric s. edelman. the soviet union went into afghanistan to prop up one faction of the people's democratic party of afghanistan (pdpa) against another. their invasion catalyzed the existing islamist opposition to the pdpa but i digress.

omaha: despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the u.s. army corps of engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive missouri river flooding. the corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from gavins point dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. the corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. until a seasonal decrease that began in november, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. areas along the missouri river and its tributaries in parts of nebraska, kansas, iowa and missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. john remus, chief of the corps' missouri river management, told the omaha world-herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the national weather service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in january and february. the corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, remus told the associated press on wednesday. once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, remus said, limiting its capacity.

town: a man from illinois drove through wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. tommy mecher, an electrician apprentice from chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. i only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, mecher said. i put it on the roof in lemont, illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to bessemer, michigan. snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. there's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. but mecher purchased the 1990 polaris indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in bessemer last friday. mecher said it took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 chevy malibu, using an old blue ford tractor with a bucket. he modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. he secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

the revelation of redl's treason just before the outbreak of world war i inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. five decades after redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, central intelligence agency director allen dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.

manchester: monks at a catholic college faced off in court monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. a judge heard motions in hillsborough superior court related to a lawsuit filed against the saint anselm college board last year. the unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. michael tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. the school was set up and run by benedictine monks for 130 years. the board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. it argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.

the economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. the former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. the latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.

compared with the price of one of the new verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. so switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. because the customer used only about 7.9 gb of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to verizon's 8 gb plan. but that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.

unlike adversary iran, iraq is a key u.s. ally in the middle east. while the u.s. military presence in the country has diminished significantly under president trump's orders, to around 2,500 troops at present, billions of u.s. tax dollars have been spent, and american forces have been killed, shoring the iraqi government up to defend itself from terrorist groups, and to help it resist the influence of its neighbor to the north, iran.

while national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. for starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. as a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.

currently, the cfpb can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, jacquot said. state attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.
we took action last night to stop a war. we did not take action to start a war, mr. trump said. the president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. but his policy toward iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.

wsoc-tv: after republican 9th congressional district candidate mark harris finished addressing mecklenburg county republicans at the charlotte mecklenburg government center monday night, reporters, including eyewitness news reporter joe bruno, tried to ask him questions. harris and a group of three or four other people used a fire exit to leave the government center as reporters attempted to ask questions. after harris opened the door on the ground level, an alarm sounded. an unidentified man tried to block reporters from using the fire escape to follow harris. when questioned if he worked for the city, the man allowed reporters to pursue the politician. reporters continued to volley questions at harris after he exited through the fire escape, but he sprinted across east 3rd street and into the parking lot of the first baptist church of charlotte, where he used to be a pastor. harris then got into a car which sped off in the opposite direction of reporters. after the bizarre exit, in a tweet to eyewitness news reporter joe bruno, harris said he had to get home to watch the college football national championship game.
jail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. the remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. in 2016, the vera institute of justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.

sioux falls: legislators have invited the crow creek sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual state of the tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of gov. kristi noem's cabinet. lawmakers on monday invited lester thompson jr. to deliver the address next week. the move is a switch from plans to have secretary of tribal relations dave flute give it. the annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the great sioux nation tribal address. that event will still happen in fort pierre across the missouri river from the capitol but has been rescheduled for after the state of the tribes address.

nadler said that the judiciary committee will also hold hearings on the december deaths of two migrant children in border patrol custody. this is inhuman and it's not precedented, he said, referring to the white house's hardline immigration agenda. it's a deliberate creation of the trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. and if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that.
but passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the sunrise movement faces considerable challenges. labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. the sunrise movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential green new deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to e&e news. in a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.
the rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the cold war was twofold. the first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. so shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.

this openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the cold war inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. the specter of a homosexual international, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful communist one. a series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.

when we think of hate speech and what sorts of things constitute hate speech, we automatically think of racism and lgbtq issues. what we don't automatically think of are things like ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities, which are rampant in society, to be sure, but sometimes get overlooked. consider the flippant use of the r word – and even a seemingly less offensive word like cripple. even disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.

if parents received tax credits in advance ― as house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and ways and means chair richard neal (d-mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.

if you listen to trump talking about how he wants a points-based immigration system and wants people who are wealthier, better educated, higher skilled and not from countries he's spoken of in derogatory, profane language — this is it. this is the policy that aims to do that, without congress approving it whatsoever, said doug rand, a former white house official under president obama who co-founded boundless, a company to help immigrants navigate the u.s. immigration system.

democratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.

the idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (aros) are fulfilled. consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the u.s. in need of remediation.
as a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.

the shutdown is helping trump keep the latest developments on russia off the top of the news. but it is not making them disappear. just this week, a redaction error in a court filing revealed that paul manafort, trump's campaign chief, passed confidential campaign polling data to a business associate with close links to the kremlin. it is the most powerful public evidence yet of coordination between russia and the trump campaign. separately, the russian lawyer who met at trump tower with donald trump jr. and other top campaign figures, natalia veselnitskaya, was indicted in an unrelated case that offered further proof of her close links to the russian government. the case against trump is becoming more ominous by the day. and that's just a small piece of his troubles.

in december, president trump made an extraordinary declaration about u.s. involvement in syria: we have won against isis. now, it's time for our troops to come back home. ignoring advice from his generals and advisers, trump said that the u.s. would leave syria. defense department officials said that they were ordered to do it within 30 days.

this is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. the bureau of labor statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. and while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.

throughout his lengthy legal career, frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of tyson foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that british oil giant bp tried to build in delaware waters.

i don't trust president trump's ability to keep us safe by himself, and i'm very concerned that he's making decisions that go against military advice, without consulting congress or our allies, kaine said in a statement to the washington post.
seidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in august 2014.
instead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the u.s. military mission in afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current u.s. deployment in iraq. that would allow the united states a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in afghanistan, as well as pakistan. the slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. that time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the afghan government and the taliban by the end of 2020.
members of congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward, ms. pelosi said in a statement. our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient war powers act notification and by the administration's briefing today.

shannon pettypiece: well, yeah. well, i mean, and-- we can talk about this. meanwhile, at the white house, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. i mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the white house is transitioning into 2020 mode. and while you have these democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to iowa, now you have a president trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. it's not the trump tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. they have raised millions and millions of dollars. they have a big data operation. they are out of the gate and running and the democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. so, i mean, that's what they're going to be up against. and they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the president might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. you might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. he was not one of those politicians who came to washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.
new york has tested more than 32,000 people for the virus, including 10,000 in one day, cuomo said. and he said the high number of new cases — new york added some 2,900 coronavirus cases from thursday to friday — should not in itself worry people.

midland: it's not what the egyptians had in mind, but it worked: a group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. it took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at bullock creek high school in midland county. they are hoping to be recognized by the guinness book of world records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. there was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, maxton herst told mlive.com. every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. it was just kind of mind-numbing work. herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on youtube. the students built the pyramid during holiday break. rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.
disqualification is necessary given mr. trump's anti-democratic response to the 2020 election and the continuing danger that he will pose to constitutional norms if allowed to flirt with a return to power in 2024. indeed, the importance of disqualification in this case is such that the congress should proceed with impeachment even if mr. trump's term in office has already concluded.

i talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, blackburn went on. they have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. what we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. we want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.

aca fixes: if there's a way for trump and the republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the aca in 2017. the administration stopped paying cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.

braun, manchin try to stop congress from getting paid during shutdowns - indianapolis star: in his first act as a u.s. senator, indiana republican mike braun is expected to introduce a bipartisan bill that would prevent members of congress — including himself — from being paid during government shutdowns. currently, lawmakers are still paid when they are unable to pass spending bills by the deadline, while most federal workers are not. the latest partial government shutdown is now in its third week, as democrats and president donald trump continue to clash over border security on the country's southern border. trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall. braun's bill, co-authored by west virginia democrat joe manchin, would also prohibit retroactive pay for lawmakers.

what they experienced was absolutely unacceptable, and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about, sanders said. when we talk about – and i do all of the time – ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words. that, they must be based in day to day reality and in the work that we do. and that was not the case, clearly not the case, in the 2016 campaign.

during weekend visits to archipelago or cotton and reed — two places where i had never made a reservation in my life — i repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. in the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. in fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: attempts to visit wunder garten or dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.

denver: an initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the november ballot. the secretary of state's office said monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. the gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of u.s. states. it was eradicated in colorado in the 1940s. colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. the rocky mountain wolf action fund is campaigning for the plan. it says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. if passed, the initiative would direct the colorado parks and wildlife commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the continental divide before 2024.

i do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realdonaldtrump from twitter, or how we got here. after a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter. was this correct? i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.

the compassionate lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. the novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the small of things, hands, wounded children — all designed to elicit sympathy. stock characters crowd the narrative. one of them, grace's world-weary colleague mitchell hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (there can be a gap between policy and practice) to border services (the agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country's official boundaries).

perhaps one of the most pointed moments in the opening of congress occurred when the congresswoman stood up to vote for nancy pelosi as house speaker. since the november election there had been endless speculation about whether she and other incoming members would vote against the speaker. when republicans booed her, she turned to them with the cameras covering the action and mouthed: sorry. with republicans hoping that ocasio-cortez and other first-termers would cause problems for the incoming speaker, it turned out that the party is pretty united on one thing: the need to stop president trump's dangerous agenda and style of governance.

cronauer: no. the reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. we did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. first of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. but secondly, there was a reaction that i would get mostly when i went out into the field. we would get an occasional card and letter. but if i'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? and i'd say cronauer. and they'd say, oh, yeah, i think i - and i'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. and i found out later on that many times the gis, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if i'd do the good morning, vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the gi equivalent of get stuffed, cronauer.

trenton: all 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, trenton officials said thursday. the announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the delaware river and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of ewing, hamilton, hopewell and lawrence. pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and trenton water works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to david smith, the water works chief engineer. residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, democratic mayor reed gusciora said. that's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. about 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

the dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.

indianapolis:family members of hoosier bank robber john dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at crown hill cemetery. the lawsuit, filed in august by dillinger nephew michael c. thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by marion county superior court judge timothy oakes on dec. 4, but thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. that deadline would have been jan. 15. but on tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on thompson's behalf. it has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. it's unknown what thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. attempts to reach the thompson family and their attorney, andrea simmons, were unsuccessful. crown hill cemetery objected to plans to exhume dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. in a written statement sent to indystar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. dillinger, born in indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. his name became legend when fbi director j. edgar hoover labeled him public enemy no.

representative adam schiff: he said a couple of things. he said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. that's not correct. i can tell you i wasn't, and there were other members of the gang of eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. in terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. and so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. it wasn't because i don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.

brett mcgurk: well they're not defeated. i've been- i've been part of this campaign for four years across two administrations. we've come a- an extraordinarily long way. and in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million syrians and iraqis. it was committing genocide against christians and yazidis and minority groups. it was planning attacks against us in the homeland. it was carrying them out in paris, that killed americans in brussels and paris. we've come a long way. we have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of isis. what that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. and what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. so as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in syria for some time. and on instructions from the white house, we were telling them, we'd stay in syria until we completed the enduring defeat of isis, not just the physical territory. we'd stay in syria until the iranians left syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in geneva to end the ultimate civil war. we had told that to our partners on the ground.

there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.

it's just not believable at this point, said trita parsi, an iran expert and executive vice president of the quincy institute for responsible statecraft, a washington, d.c. think tank. this is an administration that is doing everything it can to create conflict inside of the u.s., and now it's doing everything it can to make sure that no diplomacy can take place between the u.s. and iran after it leaves.
eliot a. cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for foreign affairs, the president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of u.s. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the united states has sustained for nearly eight decades. he explains, the real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the united states should accept a more modest role in world affairs.
biden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the american rescue plan, on thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. on average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. nearly 1.2 million americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the department of labor.

senator mike lee: yes, we can, and i believe we will. look, my grievance here is not with the president of the united states. he's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the constitution. it's not even really as much with the briefers, even though, i didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with congress. congress is the problem. we have to remember that this isn't just about this president or this war. this is about the future question of what any president can do to get us into any war. over many decades, congresses and white houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of congress to wash their hands of it--
how much government revenue they would raise: penn wharton has said biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. but that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. about half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to penn wharton's calculations.
scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the u.s. capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism. before storming the capitol, some groups prayed in the name of jesus and asked for divine protection. they flew christian and jesus 2020 flags and pointed to trump's presidency as the will of god. the linkage between christian beliefs and the violent attack on congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with trump and their support for the rioters.

indonesia's national search and rescue agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard sriwijaya air flight 182, which crashed into the ocean saturday shortly after taking off from jakarta. rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the boeing 737-500 , but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. the boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 max crashes. still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. in 2007, the european union banned all 51 indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.

[ed. note: it certainly does seem unfair that the individuals responsible for the shutdown are not among those affected by the shutdown itself. shutdowns were introduced to our budgeting process as a bipartisan penalty for intransigence. nobody is supposed to want a shutdown. but as our government has lost the capacity for budgeting and other normal fiscal duties, shutdowns have become a more significant part of our experience. that's because since the 1990s, parties have considered shutdowns as political opportunities. we score these events like games: which team won and which team lost. the idea is that no one is supposed to win. a shutdown is an embarrassment and a reflection of governmental incompetence. what's obvious now is that those ideas carry less sting then they did 40 years ago when they were instituted. so maybe we need to, as you suggest, increase the pain.]

honolulu: improvements in programs to address hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. state homeless coordinator scott morishige informed lawmakers tuesday that new york now holds the top position, the honolulu star-advertiser reported. morishige presented the data to the hawaii homelessness summit for both houses of the state legislature. the summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. placements of homeless people into permanent housing in hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. the state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. after trending upward from 2013 to 2016, hawaii's official point in time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. the decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, morishige said. there has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.

school safety in florida needs to be improved. we can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on k-12 school campuses. not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at marjory stoneman douglas high school (msdhs) on february 14, 2018.

if you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for t-mobile or sprint. both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 mbps and video to 480p resolution. this means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. there doesn't appear to be a way around sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.

representative adam schiff: well, i don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the u.s. embassy in baghdad. the brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that secretary pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. that was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. in the view of the briefers, there was plotting. there was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. and so when you hear the president out there on fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. when secretary pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. that's not an intelligence conclusion. that is pompeo's personal opinion. intelligence--

it's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to black lives matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. that's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. if they'd been black or left wing or muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the president and his allies would have been deafening.

meanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. the fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. so even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.

[t]he 21st century will demand fresher ideas — not just on farm policy, but on trade, immigration, taxation, spending, defense and other national challenges. roberts isn't the senator who will provide those new ideas, the bluntly stated op-ed read. this isn't a matter of the senator's age, although roberts will be 84 years old in 2020. it's much more about roberts' four decades of service in the house and senate, a long tenure that makes it difficult for him to see things in a different way.

the president shapes the public character of the nation. trump's character falls short. that is a quote, an excerpt. actually, the headline of a scathing new washington post op-ed by mitt romney. the former massachusetts governor and republican presidential candidate praised president trump's tax cuts and his hard line on china. but the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the united states by a new senator from his own party. this comes as trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.

more to the point, why is trump handing off chunks of the world — syria, afghanistan, the sea of azov — to america's greatest international foe? (some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) and where does this giveaway stop — at the baltics? at berlin? (it's stunning that hawks such as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), who'd melt down if president barack obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)

the cbo also estimated the move would cost 1.3 million american jobs, a claim long made by conservative economists. mr. biden's call to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour is the absolute last thing that unemployed workers need right now, michael farren, an economist with the right-leaning mercatus center at george mason university, said in an email. after all, they can't benefit from higher wages if those higher wages result in slower job growth.

the administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, bier said. i think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. so i think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.

the new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.

maddie: we talked about meeting famous people. i was obsessed with one direction at one point in my life and met harry styles after waiting outside the british fashion awards for four hours. it was ridiculous.

as an aside, we might note that rare-earth elements are a key strategic concern of the u.s., since they are vital to our military technology, as well as to our civilian tech. and yet today, the u.s. is 100 percent dependent on china for 29 minerals.

under federal law, lenders are required to cancel private mortgage insurance on most home mortgage loans made after july 29, 1999. cancellation will occur automatically when amortization has reduced the loan balance to 78% of the value of the property at the time the loan was made. the borrower cannot accelerate this process with extra payments.
but the taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands. other factions, including breakaway taliban groups and others claiming allegiance to the islamic state, have footholds around the country and potentially could grow stronger without u.s.-led forces to keep them in check.

todd said, competency has been her strength but i do believe what benghazi and libya present was this was an example of her being miscalculating, the policy was wrong. i've always believed she's more vulnerable than on the policy than on what happened. you know, why was benghazi a dangerous situation? because of the decision to topple qaddafi. that has always been her real policy vulnerability there. i actually think the incompetent tag, i see what he's trying to do there.

new york: the country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor monday. gov. andrew cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of penn station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. more than 600,000 people pass through penn station daily on trains run by amtrak, new jersey transit and the metropolitan transportation authority, operator of the long island rail road and the new york city subway system. the station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. the more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.

obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said adam laats, professor of history and education at new york state's binghamton university. there's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.

one of the most memorable moments of monson's tenure came in october 2012, when he announced at church conference that the minimum age to depart on missions was being lowered to 19 from 21 for women; and to 18 from 19 for men. the change triggered a historic influx of missionaries, and proved a milestone change for women by allowing many more to serve.

this was an attempted coup, encouraged by the president of the united states, in an attempt to derail today's congressional certification of the electoral vote that will lead to joe biden's inauguration in two weeks.
and that means greater security during times of pandemic. the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the united states will undoubtedly grow from the six known cases—in california, arizona, washington state, and illinois. but worthy of note is the case in reynosa, mexico, right next to the u.s. border. the international border next to reynosa is wide open. and so is our vulnerability to the coronavirus being carried across it.
what is less clear, is why the british government has so willingly entered into a relationship with huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the european union. australia and new zealand have warned the uk against imperilling the five-eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the united states has explicitly said huawei involvement would imperil a post-brexit trade deal.
is anybody running the executive branch of the government? who is running the executive branch? stahl asks in a preview clip released by cbs, implying that trump may have abdicated his position in the waning days of his term following criticism over the capitol security breach.
the north korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the u.s. and regional allies like south korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully. but the type of information that could potentially be gleaned from the sources revealed this past week may be one of the few windows we have to improving our understanding of one of the most isolated nations in the world.

what sanders and warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of u.s. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not americans' problem. they're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with clinton and many republicans — the idea that u.s.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. they have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like russia for the sake of american global standing. instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of u.s. citizens as well as people abroad.

to be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of iran's government, appeals based on iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. but if rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. this would minimize the risk of severe violence in iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.

the other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. he said in that interview on fox, he says i'm a very smart person. i don't need briefings every day. i don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. and that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about china or north korea or iran? is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?

the power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from constantinides in a little over five weeks. in november, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. that would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the green new deal for new york city.

graham's comments suggest he did not understand that millions of american workers are being shut out of their workplaces by government policy, minimizing the cost created by alleged incentives not to work. what's more, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits.
similarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by trump and his allies that ukraine meddled in the 2016 u.s. election. although democrats -- and some news outlets, including the associated press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the u.s. election. additionally, a 2017 investigative report by politico found extensive efforts by ukrainians to hurt trump's presidential campaign.
that means that, estimating conservatively, more than 12,000 chinese nationals entered the country illegally across the southern border in fy 2019. and none of them were screened for infectious diseases. this year a similar number are sneaking into the united states—coming from the country that is the origin of the coronavirus.

the report marks the first time the state legislature has commented publicly on the nassar case. it is one of many steps taken by lawmakers and law enforcement to figure out how multiple institutions failed hundreds of nassar's victims – many of them minors – for over 30 years. nassar was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for his crimes in both ingham and eaton counties.
an appendix to the dhs report shows that 315,000 uacs were accompanied from central america to the border by coyotes from 2013 to 2020. the vast majority were the children of illegal immigrants who had earned enough money in u.s. jobs to hire coyotes to escort their children to u.s. border officers, who then deliver the young migrants to their parents. only about 15,000 of these younger migrants have been sent home, while roughly 90,000 were allowed to stay — even though many were coming to work as child laborers in jobs that would have been held by americans.
there's an all-too familiar fight that takes place after horrible events like those in dallas and orlando, centered around firearms and how — or even whether — to regulate them.
beyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that trump endorsed the soviet invasion of afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the united states and the free world.

and while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — ronald reagan, the architect of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, would have been unlikely to use maxwell lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. i will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of israel defense forces vet gadot taking apart the egyptian king of crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.

in addressing this question, my geoscientist coauthor ellen metzger and i have had the benefit of collaborations with psychologist colleagues, edward deci and richard ryan. their research in self-determination theory, conducted over the course of four decades with a network of 500 collaborators in 39 countries, has found that the experience of happiness is regulated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs to feel competent, self-determining, and positively related to other people in the activities of one's life. these are universal needs, observed across all stages of life and in every culture in which studies have been conducted, and they help explain the truth in the ancient ideal of eudaimonia, or human flourishing.

margaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the un says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?
smithsonian: ['drunk history,' the comedy central show whose sixth season premieres january 15] features guests, often celebrities, telling historical tales while drinking with host derek waters and a cast re-enacting the stories as they're told, lip-synching to the narration. … waters first got the idea for 'drunk history' when his friend 'new girl' actor jake johnson drunkenly tried to tell him a story about otis redding's 1967 plane crash death. when waters told another actor friend, michael cera of 'arrested development' fame, about it, they decided to shoot an episode with cera playing alexander hamilton in a retelling of his fatal duel with aaron burr (this was, it should be noted, eight years before hamilton's off-broadway debut). the clip blew up online with the help of cera's star power, on the rise in 2007 thanks to superbad and juno; it's gotten more than 7.5 million views on youtube to date.
this drug should not be in the same category as heroin and lsd, and we do not need to continue with a policy that turns thousands of young people into felons every year, gaetz said in 2017. nor do we need to punish the millions of people who are sick and seeking medical help – from pain, from muscle wasting, from chemotherapy-induced nausea.

unfortunately like most things covid-related, these measures are subject to change.
but far more american voters are either jacksonians or jeffersonians. the jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, america retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and america's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (no blood for oil is the defining jeffersonian attitude toward all our middle eastern misadventures.) the jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (more rubble, less trouble is the essential jacksonian credo.) since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in washington, d.c., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize jacksonian or jeffersonian sentiment to achieve hamiltonian or wilsonian ends.

our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.
one of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. after all, it's not just, if i eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, if i eat at this restaurant, could i make my server sick? as a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. i have to admit, i kind of liked it.

phoenix: the national weather service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in maricopa and pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the phoenix metro area in 1972. they said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either f0 or f1 in intensity. but in june 1972, an f2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in paradise valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in scottsdale and east phoenix. the national weather service in phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. tornadoes are considered a rare event because the phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.

minneapolis:two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the minnesota constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. the proposal comes from alan page, a former minnesota supreme court justice, and neel kashkari, president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. they want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the star tribune reported wednesday. page and kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. even though minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. courts have interpreted the minnesota constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. page and kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. page and kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. to amend the minnesota constitution, they will need the legislature's approval to put the question to voters. the two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. but they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, education minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

john kerry: well, i think i-- i-- in fact, margaret, i think that bernie, regrettably, is distorting joe's record in the following sense. i mean he doesn't have what joe biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. i-- i think that-- that i know very well what joe's position was because i answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04. and it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy; that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. and, ultimately, we learned, as joe did and i did, that the intelligence was distorted. so joe spoke out and criticized. joe was against what they were doing. the vote was not a vote, specifically, to go to war. it was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me.

chapel hill: the university of north carolina board of governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. dth media corp., which publishes the daily tar heel student newspaper on the unc-chapel hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the board of governors and the state chapter of the sons of confederate veterans, news outlets reported on wednesday. the deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. unc-chapel hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. superior court judge allen baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. baddour approved an agreement on nov. 27 in which the scv agreed to take ownership of the silent sam statue and build a center to preserve it. the statue stood for more than a century on the chapel hill campus before protesters took it down in august 2018. the university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. in addition, unc-chapel hill paid the scv about $75,000 not to display confederate flags or similar banners on any unc system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

still, it's not all bad, and wonder woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. unlike many hollywood productions, the movie uses actual d.c. locations for both interior and exterior shots. watching wonder woman stride through the iconic smithsonian national museum of natural history's entry and take a resurrected steve on a tour of d.c.'s metro system gave the picture a genuine washington flair so often absent from movies like this. big setpieces that take place on actual washington streets in sight of the capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the reflecting pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.

seoul, south korea – north korea's acting ambassador to italy, jo song gil, went into hiding with his wife in november, south korea's spy agency told lawmakers in seoul on thursday. a high-profile defection by one of north korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader kim jong un as he pursues diplomacy with seoul and washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.

some will say terrorism in and near afghanistan can be checked even without an american military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the taliban. perhaps any future al-qaida or isis presence on afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the indian ocean. or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in afghanistan.

it took welcoming these two beautiful boys into the world for me to realize the journey i had been on was not the journey i wanted to stay on. i do not know what would've happened if i had not become a mother to them ― if the realization that i was hiding from who i really am had not accompanied them when they appeared in my world. but it did. and it made me rethink ― and re-feel ― everything.

the top brass in the pentagon, meanwhile, is hardly convinced that the islamic state has been defeated. military officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces (sdf), which it considers part of a kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the islamic state, my colleagues reported.

it won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. it ultimately will have to rely on standing committees to adopt its recommendations. and any ambitious measures are unlikely to win passage in the republican-held senate or be signed by president donald trump who has dismissed global warming as a hoax and made environmental deregulation a cornerstone of his economic agenda.

fayetteville: the washington county jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. washington county sheriff tim helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. the sheriff told the northwest arkansas democrat-gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. the county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. on monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.

realistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. it has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.

the main two downsides of the ventureone are a reduced 1.25 miles earned for every dollar you spend (instead of the 2 miles you get on the venture) and only a 20,000-mile sign-up bonus, albeit with a lower minimum spending requirement of just $1,000 in purchases in the first three months you have the account. depending on how much value you can get from these two features, you may want to consider the ventureone with no annual fee and most of the best perks.

castor: look, we've had so much delay and republicans have had their heads in the sand here in the congress. i've just been through a time in the minority on (the) energy and commerce (committee) where they refused to have even one hearing on the climate or hear any legislation dealing with the escalating cost of climate of extreme weather events. and i do see our jurisdiction as being very broad. we're talking about the planet.

but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.
t-mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. verizon, t-mobile and sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 gb a month. this may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their internet usage to a residential broadband plan.

schmidt: each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. and therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. and the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. so some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. and, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. but sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. so that disrupts dockets.
a report by out now estimates the us economy could add an extra $9 billion a year if companies improved their ability to retain lgbt talent through the implementation of inclusive policies. countries where such policies do not exist are missing out: the world bank estimates india is losing $32 billion a year in economic output precisely because of widespread discrimination against lgbt people.

at a trump rally near the white house that preceded the capitol siege, rep. mo brooks, an alabama republican and vocal trump supporter, wore a red cap saying fire pelosi, when he addressed the crowd on wednesday.
but at this point, we do not have, from the white house, any clear directive on what the country should do. and with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.
the distinction between the core and the periphery has been enough for the government to overlook security warnings from both senior intelligence figures as home, and key allies abroad. but the united states, for instance, which has been absolutely clear in its calls for huawei to be totally excluded, believes the distinction now will not protect the network from potential espionage and sabotage in future.
inskeep: so president trump from the outside can seem to have evolved on this. he started out in the campaign saying, first thing when i'm elected, i'm going to move the israeli - the embassy, the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem which would effectively recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. then he backed off of that. then he advised israel against building more settlements. what's happening to the president?
we've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while democrats will have a lead when polls open ... republicans are expected to have a strong election day, said seth bringman, a spokesman for fair fight action, a voting rights organization founded by abrams.

albuquerque: the head of new mexico's largest catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. santa fe archbishop john wester cited the centers for disease control and prevention, saying new mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. he's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend mass. parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the our father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. he said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.

representative mikie sherrill (d-new jersey/@repsherrill): well, i don't think it's a waste of time. we voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the senate, within the last month. and so i think what we're asking congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.
earlier in the day, biden delivered a speech in waukee, iowa where he didn't name a single rival democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. in the home stretch, biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: the soul of the nation is at risk due to mr. trump's actions and moral turpitude.
pelosi and her allies kiboshed the effort last month, announcing plans to move ahead with the original select committee. but the push succeeded in making a green new deal a rallying cry.
margaret brennan: i want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key-- a key-- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. i'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a senate trial?
but this would hardly count as success for the protesters. after all, rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. if protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.
it is not against the law for a president to knowingly and repeatedly lie to the country, even though regular and extensive dishonesty from a president makes a mockery of democratic decision making.

there are so many demands, pompeo explained, because at a fundamental level, iran is breaching the most basic norms of international behavior. every single activity he demanded that iran halt is an activity that undermines not only regional security, but also u.s. national security. as such, compelling iranian compliance with the trump administration's demands is vital to the security of the american people.
but the messages i was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. as i got old enough to make my own decisions, i chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. i made no efforts to diversify my social circle. ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.

the chief thought the answer was to punish me, seidle said. you know, if i forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that i was under stress and i was just having trouble coping. having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. and he knew that, he knew that.

the rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. the select committee on the climate crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when democrats last controlled the house. but, the house rules give the panel until march 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.

what could be better: while the high cost of the chase sapphire reserve was easy to justify for the last several years, it increased its annual fee from $450 to $550 at the start of 2020, so you really need to be able to use all of the card's perks for the price to make sense, which can be difficult given the current worldwide travel situation.
in b.c., a compositional shift towards softer sales and slowing price growth.
the plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by wyden and many democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the september cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.

we are still in the fog of war. but some things are clear. the politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this president's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. the republican members of congress -- like senators ted cruz and josh hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. so is trump's attorney, rudy giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a save america rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.
the dow fell 786 points, or almost 3%, to 25,917 on tuesday, while the s&p 500 and tech-heavy nasdaq indexes both slid about 3%. the decline followed a surprise move by the central bank to lower rates by 0.5% in a bid to bolster the u.s. economy as the coronavirus spreads to more states. the rate cut comes after seven major economies pledged early tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the outbreak.

trump's actions: with his executive order last year, trump signaled that he would undermine the aca's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. trump calculated that would bring the democrats to the table, but democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for medicaid beneficiaries. these decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.

shannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.

thompson: well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. we wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. so what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. so what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. so again, let me be very clear. democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.
but a fighting force — even one as formidable as the united states military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. for service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. these choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.

madison: republicans decided tuesday to place only president donald trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. a committee made up of republicans and democrats met with state election officials in the capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the april 7 primary ballot. the republican committee members submitted only trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. the democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. the republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other gop hopefuls such as former massachusetts gov. bill weld and former illinois rep. joe walsh to get on the gop primary ballot. they could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by jan. 28.
