some progressive groups have protested ms. raimondo's selection, arguing that the biden administration should look to a populist democrat instead. in a jan. 6 announcement, the revolving door project and demand progress criticized ms. raimondo as a corporate insider who locked in liability protection for businesses but stripped funding from low-income areas of rhode island during the pandemic.
when you're in a race, there's only two ways to win. one is to trip the other guy, and the other is to run faster, mr. reinsch said. and to biden's credit, he's really focused on running faster.
i think it's a huge result, said dr. anthony gordon, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at imperial college london and the trial's lead researcher. showing that drugs that are available and can be used to save lives, in this pandemic, is a wonderful achievement.
michael smart, a managing director and trade expert at rock creek global advisors, said a large part of the biden administration's affirmative agenda in response to china, which includes efforts to make the american economy more competitive, would fall within the commerce department's jurisdiction.
a progressive democrat could wield the powers of the commerce department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.
historically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. but given the growing importance of the u.s. competition with china, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.
mr. trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
how fitting is it that president trump's first oval office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the american public about a crisis largely of his own making?
not that the border crisis is one of mr. trump's self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. it may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president's nurturing, become something far more tragic.
the findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 i.c.u. patients treated early with these drugs. all of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.
the results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
the british government on friday issued new guidance encouraging health care providers to use two arthritis drugs to treat severely sick covid-19 patients, following the release of promising data from a clinical trial that has not yet undergone formal scientific review.
william reinsch, the scholl chair in international business at the center for strategic and international studies, said mr. biden and his team had placed a lot of emphasis on competing more effectively with china, including efforts to augment american industry that could be run through the commerce department.
some critics have asked whether ms. raimondo has the technical background to devise and carry out a strategy to deal with technology challenges from china. in addition to denouncing deindustrialization and promoting business in rhode island, she does have firsthand experience with china's economic challenges: her father was laid off when the watch factory where he worked in providence, r.i., moved to china.
pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, mr. trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas.
