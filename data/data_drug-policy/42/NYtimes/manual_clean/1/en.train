The failure to distribute these doses to states who request them is unconscionable and unacceptable, the governors wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times and sent Friday to the secretary of health, Alex M. Azar II, and Gen. Gustave F. Perna, who is in charge of vaccine distribution. We demand that the federal government begin distributing these reserved doses to states immediately, the letter said. Mr. Biden's promise of 100 million shots in arms is an ambitious one, and the Trump administration's rocky rollout — which Mr. Biden called a travesty on Friday — has not made his task any easier. As of Thursday, the Trump administration had shipped more than 21 million vaccine doses, and millions more were already in the federal government's hands. Yet only 5.9 million people had received a dose. State and local public health officials, already overwhelmed with rising infections, have been struggling to administer the vaccine to hospital workers and at-risk older Americans while most people remain in the dark about when they might be protected.", "augmented": []}

Infection rates went on falling — by an average of 18 percent — where large universities chose to teach remotely, the researchers found, but the rates shot up where in-person instruction was underway. The researchers did not take account of whether students were physically present on campus, even if classes were being held remotely, Dr. Lisa Barrios, a member of the C.D.C. 's Covid-19 response team, pointed out. As a result, she said, it was hard to know whether the large decreases in remote-learning counties happened because fewer students were physically present, or because the universities did other things as well, like impose rigorous mask mandates and bans on social gatherings. The study also compared counties with large universities teaching in person against counties less than 500 miles away with about the same total population but no large university, and found similarly sharp differences in virus incidence: an 80 percent rise in the university counties, versus a drop of nearly 20 percent in the others. Dr. Barrios urged universities to increase testing when students return to campus and make adequate provisions to isolate and quarantine infected and exposed students. Students and staff members who catch the virus may increase the risks to people off campus, particularly those who are older or have underlying health problems.

But it is far from certain that the vaccines are so interchangeable, several researchers warned. Viewed as cavalier departures from scientifically backed guidance, experts said, these decisions could further erode public trust in vaccines at a time when deployment is crucial and a new and potentially more transmissible variant of the coronavirus continues to ricochet around the globe. Even the appearance of tinkering has negatives, in terms of people having trust in the process, said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. You can have a highly efficacious vaccine, but if you can't get it to people, then it's not going to give that protection. The idea of delaying the second dose appears to have gained little traction in the upper echelons of the U.S. government. In a news conference on Wednesday, Moncef Slaoui, the scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed — the federal effort to accelerate vaccine development and distribution — expressed skepticism about the idea.

She was not involved in the new study. My general impression is that tocilizumab and sarilumab do work for some patients, Dr. Kaplan-Lewis added. But there is a sweet spot — it's not for everybody, at all times. While many treatments for Covid-19 target the coronavirus itself, drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab work to quiet the immune system which, when triggered by an infection, can overreact and start to destroy the body's own tissues. This immunological friendly fire is thought to fan the flames of many of the most serious cases of Covid-19.

The measure was needed due to the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on E.M.S. and 9-1-1 receiving hospitals, Dr. Marianne Gausche-Hill, the agency's medical director, wrote in the directive. What the memo actually reflected, though, was an effort to spare overburdened emergency rooms from having to spend time and resources on patients who were already beyond their help.

Mario Tama/Getty Images A coronavirus outbreak aboard a September flight from Dubai to New Zealand offered researchers — and airlines — an opportunity to study in-transit contagion. After the 18-hour flight from Dubai landed in Auckland, local health authorities discovered evidence of an outbreak that most likely occurred during the trip. Using seat maps and genetic analysis, the new study determined that one passenger initiated a chain of infection that spread to four others en route. Previous research on apparent in-flight outbreaks focused on flights that occurred last spring, when few travelers wore masks, planes were running near capacity and the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. The new report, of a largely empty flight in the fall, details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware of and more cautious about the risks. The findings deliver a clear warning to both airlines and passengers, experts said. The key message here is that you have to have multiple layers of prevention — requiring testing before boarding, social distancing on the flight and masks, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not part of the study team. Those things all went wrong in different ways on this flight, and if they'd just tested properly, this wouldn't have happened.", "augmented": []}

So far, at least, the variant does not seem to make people any sicker or lead to more deaths. Still, there is cause for concern: A variant that is more transmissible will increase the death toll simply because it will spread faster and infect more people. The routes of transmission — by large and small droplets, and tiny aerosolized particles adrift in crowded indoor spaces — have not changed. Infection with the new variant may increase the amount of virus in the body. Some preliminary evidence from Britain suggests that people infected with the new variant tend to carry greater amounts of the virus in their noses and throats than those infected with previous versions. That finding offers one possible explanation for why the new variant spreads more easily: The more virus that infected people harbor in their noses and throats, the more they expel into the air and onto surfaces when they breathe, talk, sing, cough or sneeze.", "augmented": []}

The study was posted online Thursday night on the web site Biorxiv. It has not yet gone through formal scientific review. Independent experts said the findings are good news, but cautioned that each of the variants has several other potentially dangerous mutations that have not yet been investigated.

The new variant, known as B.1.1.7, first raised concern in December, when British researchers realized that it was rapidly becoming more common among people with Covid-19.

{"original": "On Friday, Public Health England released a new study of B.1.1.7 in which researchers estimated that the variant is 30 to 50 percent more transmissible than other forms of the virus. The viral lineage leading to B.1.1.7 has accumulated 23 mutations. Of particular concern to scientists are eight mutations that affect the gene for a protein called spike on the surface of coronaviruses. That's because the viruses use the spike protein to grab onto human cells. It's possible that one or more of them help B.1.1.7 invade cells more successfully. One of these mutations, known as N501Y, is particularly worrisome. Experiments have demonstrated that it enables the virus to bind to cells more tightly. And it has also arisen in other lineages of the coronavirus, including a variant identified in South Africa in December. That variant, called B.1.351, rapidly spread through the country, and has spread to a dozen other countries so far. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch ran an experiment to see if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine worked against viruses with the N501Y mutation. They found that in cells in the lab, the mutant virus could not infect human cells mixed with antibodies from vaccinated people. The antibodies latched onto the coronaviruses and blocked them from grabbing into cells. Despite the N501Y mutation, the experiment showed, the vaccine-generated antibodies were still able to latch onto the viruses.", "augmented": []}
