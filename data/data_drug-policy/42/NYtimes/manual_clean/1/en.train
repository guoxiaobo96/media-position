's covid-19 response team, pointed out. as a result, she said, it was hard to know whether the large decreases in remote-learning counties happened because fewer students were physically present, or because the universities did other things as well, like impose rigorous mask mandates and bans on social gatherings. the study also compared counties with large universities teaching in person against counties less than 500 miles away with about the same total population but no large university, and found similarly sharp differences in virus incidence: an 80 percent rise in the university counties, versus a drop of nearly 20 percent in the others. dr. barrios urged universities to increase testing when students return to campus and make adequate provisions to isolate and quarantine infected and exposed students. students and staff members who catch the virus may increase the risks to people off campus, particularly those who are older or have underlying health problems. most universities don't exist in a bubble, dr. barrios said.", "augmented": []}
