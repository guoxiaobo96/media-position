It was Japan's first emergency declaration because of the pandemic since April. The announcement came five days after governors from the affected prefectures had pleaded with the central government to act. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, reluctant to hurt the economy, had hesitated to invoke the emergency measure, but he eventually bowed to the pressure. Deaths from the virus in Japan have doubled in less than two months, passing 3,700, and Tokyo's governor has warned that the medical system is under stress. Polls have shown widespread dissatisfaction with Mr. Suga's four-month-old administration and its handling of the pandemic. The emergency declaration, which will last one month, relies mostly on voluntary compliance, and health experts warned that it might not be enough to turn the tide.

The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world.

The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

With the variant, we might expect 15 percent of those, Dr. Bedford said. Currently risky activities become more risky. Scientists are still learning how the mutations have changed the virus. Each infected person offers opportunities for the virus to mutate as it multiplies. With more than 83 million people infected worldwide, the coronavirus is amassing mutations faster than scientists expected at the start of the pandemic. The vast majority of mutations provide no advantage to the virus and die out. But mutations that improve the virus's fitness or transmissibility have a greater chance to catch on. At least one of the 17 new mutations in the variant contributes to its greater contagiousness. The mechanism is not yet known. Some data suggest that the new variant may bind more tightly to a protein on the surface of human cells, allowing it to more readily infect them.

Let me be clear: The violence we saw yesterday in our nation's capital was appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way. We condemn it, the president and this administration, in the strongest possible terms. It is unacceptable. And those that broke the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. What we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate First Amendment rights of the many thousands who came to peacefully have their voices heard in our nation's capital. Those who violently besieged our Capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for. The core value of our administration is the idea that all citizens have the right to live in safety, peace and freedom. Those who are working in this building are working to ensure an orderly transition of power. Now it is time for America to unite, to come together, to reject the violence that we have seen.

To scientists who watched dismayed as the scenes unfolded on television, the throngs of unmasked intruders who wandered through hallways and into private offices may also have transformed the riot into a super-spreader event. The coronavirus thrives indoors, particularly in crowded spaces, lingering in the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If even a few extremists were infected — likely, given the current rates of spread and the crowd size — then the virus would have had the ideal opportunity to find new victims, experts said. It has all the elements of what we warn people about, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. People yelling and screaming, chanting, exerting themselves — all of those things provide opportunity for the virus to spread, and this virus takes those opportunities. President Trump has downplayed the pandemic almost since its beginning, and many of his supporters who broke into the Capitol on Wednesday did not appear to be wearing masks or making any effort at social distancing.

James Tensuan for The New York Times The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule that could classify millions of workers in industries like construction, cleaning and the gig economy as contractors rather than employees, another step under the Trump administration toward endorsing the business practices of companies like Uber and Lyft. Companies don't have to pay contractors a minimum wage or overtime and don't have to pay a share of contractors' Social Security taxes or contribute to unemployment insurance on their behalf. By contrast, companies that hire employees must provide them with those benefits and protections, which can raise labor costs 20 to 30 percent, according to estimates from industry officials. This rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, the labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, said in a statement, adding that the rule makes it easier to identify legitimate employees while recognizing and respecting the entrepreneurial spirit of workers who choose to pursue the freedom associated with being an independent contractor. The rule is scheduled to take effect on March 8, which will allow the incoming Biden administration to postpone it and perhaps set it aside.", "augmented": []}

But there is a sweet spot — it's not for everybody, at all times. While many treatments for Covid-19 target the coronavirus itself, drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab work to quiet the immune system which, when triggered by an infection, can overreact and start to destroy the body's own tissues. This immunological friendly fire is thought to fan the flames of many of the most serious cases of Covid-19.

Companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt sometimes set up temporary accounts for clients when they prepare returns. For example, clients who opts to have preparation fees deducted from their refund may be issued one of these accounts, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest.

Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year.

Mario Tama/Getty Images A coronavirus outbreak aboard a September flight from Dubai to New Zealand offered researchers — and airlines — an opportunity to study in-transit contagion. After the 18-hour flight from Dubai landed in Auckland, local health authorities discovered evidence of an outbreak that most likely occurred during the trip. Using seat maps and genetic analysis, the new study determined that one passenger initiated a chain of infection that spread to four others en route. Previous research on apparent in-flight outbreaks focused on flights that occurred last spring, when few travelers wore masks, planes were running near capacity and the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. The new report, of a largely empty flight in the fall, details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware of and more cautious about the risks. The findings deliver a clear warning to both airlines and passengers, experts said. The key message here is that you have to have multiple layers of prevention — requiring testing before boarding, social distancing on the flight and masks, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not part of the study team.

{"original": "If a second dose of the vaccine a patient originally received isn't available, or if the manufacturer of the first shot isn't known, health officials said, another vaccine may be used for the second shot. But it is far from certain that the vaccines are so interchangeable, several researchers warned. Viewed as cavalier departures from scientifically backed guidance, experts said, these decisions could further erode public trust in vaccines at a time when deployment is crucial and a new and potentially more transmissible variant of the coronavirus continues to ricochet around the globe. Even the appearance of tinkering has negatives, in terms of people having trust in the process, said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. You can have a highly efficacious vaccine, but if you can't get it to people, then it's not going to give that protection. The idea of delaying the second dose appears to have gained little traction in the upper echelons of the U.S. government. In a news conference on Wednesday, Moncef Slaoui, the scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed — the federal effort to accelerate vaccine development and distribution — expressed skepticism about the idea. It's very important, I think, to use the vaccine based on how you have studied it, Dr. Slaoui said.

Officials in the state of São Paulo, where a prominent medical research institute carried out a large study of the vaccine made by the Beijing-based Sinovac, said the inoculation had an efficacy rate of 78 percent. The vaccine prevented all participants from developing serious and mild complications from the virus, officials said, calling it a highly effective preventive tool. In anticipation of approval, the vaccine, called CoronaVac, has already been shipped around the world as countries prepare for mass inoculation campaigns. Sinovac has sold more than 300 million doses, mostly to low- and middle-income countries, accounting for about half of the total doses that China says vaccine makers were capable of producing in 2020, based on an analysis of company statements and media reports.

A deserted Covent Garden on Tuesday, the first day of England's third lockdown due to the coronavirus. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times By the time Britain imposed its first pandemic lockdown last March, more than 1,000 people had entered the country with the coronavirus and infected others, scientists reported on Friday in the most detailed account to date of the virus's arrival and spread through a nation. Other countries with high rates of international travel, like the United States, likely had similar numbers of introductions of the virus in the first months of the pandemic, the authors wrote. The researchers, based at the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh, analyzed more than 50,000 genomes compiled by the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, the largest such collection in the world. About 75 percent of the infected travelers who started chains of infection in the country during that early period came from Spain, France, or Italy; less than 1 percent came from China. The epidemic that those introductions created in Britain last spring was one of the world's largest, consisting of more than 1,000 distinct infection chains, which scientists call lineages.

Infection rates went on falling — by an average of 18 percent — where large universities chose to teach remotely, the researchers found, but the rates shot up where in-person instruction was underway. The researchers did not take account of whether students were physically present on campus, even if classes were being held remotely, Dr. Lisa Barrios, a member of the C.D.C. 's Covid-19 response team, pointed out. As a result, she said, it was hard to know whether the large decreases in remote-learning counties happened because fewer students were physically present, or because the universities did other things as well, like impose rigorous mask mandates and bans on social gatherings. The study also compared counties with large universities teaching in person against counties less than 500 miles away with about the same total population but no large university, and found similarly sharp differences in virus incidence: an 80 percent rise in the university counties, versus a drop of nearly 20 percent in the others. Dr. Barrios urged universities to increase testing when students return to campus and make adequate provisions to isolate and quarantine infected and exposed students. Students and staff members who catch the virus may increase the risks to people off campus, particularly those who are older or have underlying health problems. Most universities don't exist in a bubble, Dr. Barrios said.", "augmented": []}

Mario Tama/Getty Images A coronavirus outbreak aboard a September flight from Dubai to New Zealand offered researchers — and airlines — an opportunity to study in-transit contagion. After the 18-hour flight from Dubai landed in Auckland, local health authorities discovered evidence of an outbreak that most likely occurred during the trip. Using seat maps and genetic analysis, the new study determined that one passenger initiated a chain of infection that spread to four others en route. Previous research on apparent in-flight outbreaks focused on flights that occurred last spring, when few travelers wore masks, planes were running near capacity and the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. The new report, of a largely empty flight in the fall, details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware of and more cautious about the risks. The findings deliver a clear warning to both airlines and passengers, experts said. The key message here is that you have to have multiple layers of prevention — requiring testing before boarding, social distancing on the flight and masks, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not part of the study team.

With the variant, we might expect 15 percent of those, Dr. Bedford said. Currently risky activities become more risky. Scientists are still learning how the mutations have changed the virus. Each infected person offers opportunities for the virus to mutate as it multiplies. With more than 83 million people infected worldwide, the coronavirus is amassing mutations faster than scientists expected at the start of the pandemic. The vast majority of mutations provide no advantage to the virus and die out. But mutations that improve the virus's fitness or transmissibility have a greater chance to catch on. At least one of the 17 new mutations in the variant contributes to its greater contagiousness. The mechanism is not yet known. Some data suggest that the new variant may bind more tightly to a protein on the surface of human cells, allowing it to more readily infect them. Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government, said it's important to look at evidence as preliminary and accumulating.

Apu Gomes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images With hospitals in Los Angeles County swamped with Covid-19 patients, a memo that went out to the county's ambulance crews last week caused public alarm and prompted explanations from medics on social media about their care practices. In the memo, a slightly updated version of which was released on Monday, the county Emergency Medical Services Agency instructed the crews not to transport most adult patients whose hearts had stopped beating to a hospital if resuscitation in the field was unsuccessful or if the patients met established criteria for declaring death. The measure was needed due to the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on E.M.S. and 9-1-1 receiving hospitals, Dr. Marianne Gausche-Hill, the agency's medical director, wrote in the directive. What the memo actually reflected, though, was an effort to spare overburdened emergency rooms from having to spend time and resources on patients who were already beyond their help. And rather than a dire last resort, it was actually a relatively small change from the county's previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from taking most patients whose heartbeats could not be restored where they were found to the hospital.", "augmented": []}

The only other alternative--the one proposed by Herzl--is for all Jews to move to Israel, where they control their own destiny. But most Jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands.

Losing balance costs speed, and long practice is needed to attain this skill. But once it is mastered, the skier can speed across the landscape, almost floating above the snow.

Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate.

David Zalubowski/Associated Press General Motors said its vehicle sales in the United States fell 12 percent in 2020, but increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, a hopeful sign for the auto industry at the end of a difficult year. The automaker reported solid performances from its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands in the final three months of the year. They offset a 10 percent drop in sales of Buick vehicles. Overall, G.M. sold 2.5 million cars and light trucks in 2020, down from nearly 2.9 million a year earlier. Auto sales fell sharply last spring as consumers stayed away from dealerships because of the coronavirus pandemic. G.M. and other automakers were forced to halt production for most of the second quarter when government officials forced many businesses to shut down to stop the spread of the virus. But sales rebounded once factories restarted in part because of pent-up demand for cars and trucks. Some Americans bought cars in order to avoid mass transit and shared rides. It helped that people had more disposable income because they were spending less on travel, dining and entertainment.

Our Constitution and our Republic will overcome this stain, and 'We the People' will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect union while Mr. Trump will deservedly be left a man without a country, Mr. Mattis said. He had issued a withering critique of the president's leadership in June during growing protests across the country.

Ben Gray/Associated Press The Democrats now appear favored to prevail in both of their Senate races in Georgia, and therefore are the favorites to take control of the U.S. Senate. The two Republican candidates hold small leads in the vote count, and still have a chance to hold onto those advantages, but most of the remaining vote is in Democratic-leaning areas. The largest block of remaining ballots is the in-person vote in DeKalb County, a heavily Democratic area that includes part of Atlanta. Over all, the two Democratic candidates are favored to win the remaining vote by around nine percentage points, according to Upshot estimates. Democrats benefited from strong turnout among Black voters, who are on track to represent a much larger share of the electorate than they did in the general election, based on the turnout by precinct and early voting data.

Today, there are no burdens from which to escape. Being Jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about.

When he did recognize Mr. Biden, his critics argued that the acknowledgment came too late, and that by waiting silently, Mr. McConnell had allowed Mr. Trump to sow dangerous disinformation with millions of Republican voters, drawing the backing of elected officials in his own party.

The coronavirus pandemic sharply slowed sales for automakers as people stayed away from dealerships and companies were forced to shut down factories for nearly two months last spring.

Cars made up just 7 percent of total sales; the rest were trucks and sport-utility vehicles. The company said its shift to focus on larger vehicles is paying off. Sales of sport utility vehicles, which generate much more profit for automakers than sedans, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Ford began selling a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck, which has long been the top selling vehicle in the United States.

Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.'

Marc Levy/Associated Press The effort by congressional Republicans to deny the presidential results found an echo in the Pennsylvania legislature on Tuesday, when Republicans voted not to seat a Democratic lawmaker who was elected in November and to remove the lieutenant governor, also a Democrat, as the presiding officer of the State Senate. On a typically ceremonial day of swearing in members, Pennsylvania's Senate majority refused to seat Senator Jim Brewster, whose narrow victory was officially certified but is being challenged in court. In a contentious, chaotic session, Republicans also voted to remove Lt. Gov. John Fetterman as the Senate president and to replace him with the top Republican in the chamber. The lieutenant governor refused at first to leave the rostrum, and for several minutes both he and the Republican voted into his place tried to recognize motions from the floor. Eventually, Mr. Fetterman stepped away. I was escorted out, Mr. Fetterman said in an interview minutes later. This was a corruption of the fundamental democratic franchise in our state.

The preliminary injunction, from Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson, came in a class-action lawsuit brought by two inmates at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Ind., where federal executions are held. The inmates, who are not on death row but in a separate, medium-security part of the complex, argued, in part, that the 10 executions the Trump administration's prison authorities have carried out since July exposed them to a substantial risk of contracting the virus. The Trump administration has appealed prior attempts to block or delay executions, and the Supreme Court has allowed each one to proceed. During the pandemic, executions have drawn scrutiny for their potential to become super-spreader events. Each brings about 50 to 125 people to the Terre Haute prison complex, according to an estimate by the Bureau of Prisons, an arm of the Justice Department.

He will become the executive chairman of TPG Rise Climate, a new fund run by the investment firm TPG. The move brings Mr. Paulson, 74, back to the industry for the first time since he left Goldman to become Treasury secretary in 2006 under President George W. Bush. It may also signal a turning point for the weight and seriousness given to climate-related investments, already a focus for TPG. The firm's co-founder, Jim Coulter, is planning to shift much of his focus to the new climate fund. Mr. Paulson has spent the last 12 years since leaving his post at the Treasury away from the private sector, running his nonprofit institute and working on climate change initiatives. He was recruited to TPG, in part, by Bono, the musician and activist who helped found TPG's $5 billion Rise funds focused on impact investing.

The university installed vending machines at 11 locations across campus Jan. 2, in an effort to improve access to testing, which is required weekly for students and campus employees. Users have 72 hours to return the free test kit to a drop box near a vending machine, according to the university's website, and must use a campus app linked to their personal information to scan and obtain their results. The tests are only recommended for those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The vending machine strategy has come as California is reeling from an explosion of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

In the memo, a slightly updated version of which was released on Monday, the county Emergency Medical Services Agency instructed the crews not to transport most adult patients whose hearts had stopped beating to a hospital if resuscitation in the field was unsuccessful or if the patients met established criteria for declaring death. The measure was needed due to the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on E.M.S. and 9-1-1 receiving hospitals, Dr. Marianne Gausche-Hill, the agency's medical director, wrote in the directive. What the memo actually reflected, though, was an effort to spare overburdened emergency rooms from having to spend time and resources on patients who were already beyond their help.

It was only hours into the melee, and after an explosive device was found at the Republican National Committee headquarters, that Mr. Trump released a message telling the mob to leave. You have to go home now, he said in a video message filmed at the White House and posted on Twitter. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We don't want anyone hurt. Still, the president ultimately offered encouragement to the mob, noting: We love you. You're very special, and I know how you feel. But many advisers around the president were worried that his message in the video was not forceful enough and that some of his supporters would interpret it as encouragement to continue fighting for him. Alyssa Farah, who resigned last month from her post as the White House communications director, tweeted a more direct message at the president's supporters. Dear MAGA- I am one of you. Before I worked for @realDonaldTrump, I worked for @MarkMeadows & @Jim_Jordan & the @freedomcaucus, she said, establishing her conservative bona fides. I marched in the 2010 Tea Party rallies.

So far, at least, the variant does not seem to make people any sicker or lead to more deaths.

Infection with the new variant may increase the amount of virus in the body. Some preliminary evidence from Britain suggests that people infected with the new variant tend to carry greater amounts of the virus in their noses and throats than those infected with previous versions. That finding offers one possible explanation for why the new variant spreads more easily: The more virus that infected people harbor in their noses and throats, the more they expel into the air and onto surfaces when they breathe, talk, sing, cough or sneeze.", "augmented": []}

Other countries with high rates of international travel, like the United States, likely had similar numbers of introductions of the virus in the first months of the pandemic, the authors wrote.

Even so, Dr. Bedford said, it is likely to catch on rapidly and become the predominant form in the United States by March. The variant behaves like earlier versions. So far, at least, the variant does not seem to make people any sicker or lead to more deaths. Still, there is cause for concern: A variant that is more transmissible will increase the death toll simply because it will spread faster and infect more people. The routes of transmission — by large and small droplets, and tiny aerosolized particles adrift in crowded indoor spaces — have not changed. Infection with the new variant may increase the amount of virus in the body. Some preliminary evidence from Britain suggests that people infected with the new variant tend to carry greater amounts of the virus in their noses and throats than those infected with previous versions. That finding offers one possible explanation for why the new variant spreads more easily: The more virus that infected people harbor in their noses and throats, the more they expel into the air and onto surfaces when they breathe, talk, sing, cough or sneeze.", "augmented": []}

State troopers later dispersed that crowd. The State Capitol has been the scene of other volatile protests in recent months, often around coronavirus restrictions that Mr. Inslee has put in effect.

The study was posted online Thursday night on the web site Biorxiv. It has not yet gone through formal scientific review. Independent experts said the findings are good news, but cautioned that each of the variants has several other potentially dangerous mutations that have not yet been investigated. So it's possible that one of those mutations affects how well the vaccine works. It's the first step in the right direction, said Dr. John Brooks, the chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control Covid-19 emergency response. I'm hoping that the additional work that comes out in the future will fall in line with that finding. The new variant, known as B.1.1.7, first raised concern in December, when British researchers realized that it was rapidly becoming more common among people with Covid-19.

We weren't surprised that Georgia turned blue, because we've been working on it for over 15 years, Deborah Scott, the founder of Georgia Stand Up, said after Mr. Biden's victory in the general election. It's been an uphill battle, said Felicia Davis, a longtime organizer in Clayton County. Because here, we're not just women, we're Southern women. And we're not just Southern women, we're Southern Black women. Still, Ms. Abrams was the most visible face at the forefront of the turnout push. And when it came time to cut a TV ad urging Georgians to confirm the status of their absentee ballots — voters have until Friday to cure absentee ballots that contain minor errors — she appeared in the ad reminding them how to do so.

The paper reported that treatment regimens that included the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among Covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not take the drugs.

The viral lineage leading to B.1.1.7 has accumulated 23 mutations. Of particular concern to scientists are eight mutations that affect the gene for a protein called spike on the surface of coronaviruses. That's because the viruses use the spike protein to grab onto human cells. It's possible that one or more of them help B.1.1.7 invade cells more successfully. One of these mutations, known as N501Y, is particularly worrisome. Experiments have demonstrated that it enables the virus to bind to cells more tightly. And it has also arisen in other lineages of the coronavirus, including a variant identified in South Africa in December. That variant, called B.1.351, rapidly spread through the country, and has spread to a dozen other countries so far. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch ran an experiment to see if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine worked against viruses with the N501Y mutation. They found that in cells in the lab, the mutant virus could not infect human cells mixed with antibodies from vaccinated people. The antibodies latched onto the coronaviruses and blocked them from grabbing into cells. Despite the N501Y mutation, the experiment showed, the vaccine-generated antibodies were still able to latch onto the viruses.", "augmented": []}

Joao Silva/The New York Times LAGOS, Nigeria — As the pandemic has swept across the world, it has become increasingly evident that in a vast majority of countries on the African continent, most deaths are never formally registered. Reliable data on a country's deaths and their causes are hard to come by, which means governments can miss emerging health threats — whether Ebola or the coronavirus — and often have to formulate health policy blindly. Covid-19 has been said to have largely bypassed Africa. But as with other diseases, the virus's true toll here will probably never be known, partly because elevated mortality rates cannot be used as a measure the way they are elsewhere. In other parts of the world, epidemics have been identified by unusual spikes in deaths compared with the mortality rate in a normal year.

They continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most Jews, as anti-Semites in previous generations did. Today's marginalized anti-Semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry.

Its Covid-19 death toll can be counted on two hands. It is the kind of success that has created a sinking feeling in the stomachs of many residents: How much longer can the island's good fortune last? The high walls have kept the island from being deluged with infections, but they risk isolating Taiwan economically and politically if the rest of the world relaxes its defenses as vaccinations get underway. Japan and South Korea, two other Asian democracies praised for their virus responses, are now grappling with large flare-ups of new infections. For Chen Shih-chung, Taiwan's health minister and head of its epidemic command center, success is all the more reason not to waver on the government's strategy. The island has been sealed off to most visitors since March. People who are allowed to enter still have to quarantine under tight watch for two weeks.

The Trump administration has appealed prior attempts to block or delay executions, and the Supreme Court has allowed each one to proceed.

Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times The threat to impeach President Trump in his final days in office raises political, constitutional and logistical questions rarely contemplated in American history: No president has ever been impeached twice or after already losing re-election. Here are four key things to know: There is nothing preventing a second impeachment. The House impeached Mr. Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the Senate acquitted him. No American president has ever been impeached twice. But there appears to be nothing in the Constitution stopping Congress from impeaching again on a new set of charges. The timing is tight, but not impossible. Past presidential impeachments have typically been drawn-out affairs with investigations, hearings and weeks of public debate, but that is not required. If Democrats and some Republicans are in agreement, they can bypass the House Judiciary Committee and move in a matter of days to draw up charges and proceed directly to a debate and vote on the floor of the House. Then, if the House votes to adopt articles of impeachment, they can immediately transmit them to the Senate, which must promptly begin a trial.

The state's handling of the virus has come under repeated criticism. Recently, planned transfers of medically vulnerable inmates from San Quentin to other prisons were abruptly halted after public objections. This spring, another inmate transfer ultimately led to more than 2,600 infections of inmates and guards and 28 inmate deaths at San Quentin. The crowded, unsanitary conditions in prisons have made them epicenters for the virus. In recent weeks, there have been heated discussions in some states about whether inmates should receive vaccinations ahead of others. The infection rate among inmates is more than four times higher than rates among members of the general public, and the death rate is twice as high. At Avenal, which state figures say is at 116 percent occupancy, Thai Tran, 43, tested positive for the virus last month. Before he fell ill, he had been sleeping in a crowded gym with some 140 other inmates, said his wife, Michelle Tran. If incarcerated people are to be kept safe from the virus, inmates and correctional officers alike should receive vaccinations, Ms. Tran said.

A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised.

To scientists who watched dismayed as the scenes unfolded on television, the throngs of unmasked intruders who wandered through hallways and into private offices may also have transformed the riot into a super-spreader event. The coronavirus thrives indoors, particularly in crowded spaces, lingering in the air in tiny particles called aerosols.

It has all the elements of what we warn people about, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. People yelling and screaming, chanting, exerting themselves — all of those things provide opportunity for the virus to spread, and this virus takes those opportunities. President Trump has downplayed the pandemic almost since its beginning, and many of his supporters who broke into the Capitol on Wednesday did not appear to be wearing masks or making any effort at social distancing.

By Reuters The top Democrats in Congress called on Thursday for President Trump's immediate removal from office for his role in urging on the violent mob that overtook the Capitol a day before, disrupting the ratification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s electoral victory. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows him and the cabinet to wrest the power of the presidency from Mr. Trump. If Mr. Pence declines to act, they said, Democrats were prepared to impeach Mr. Trump for a second time. While it's only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America, Ms. Pelosi said, calling Mr. Trump's actions on Wednesday a seditious act. The speaker's plan was announced during an extraordinary news conference in the reclaimed Capitol, hours after the building was overrun by a mob of Trump supporters who temporarily halted Congress's confirmation of Mr. Biden's victory in the presidential election. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Pelosi singled out members of the cabinet by name, asking why they would not intervene. Are they ready to say for the next 13 days this dangerous man can assault our democracy?", "augmented": []}

Reuters The mob that stormed the Capitol yesterday did not just threaten the heart of American democracy. To scientists who watched dismayed as the scenes unfolded on television, the throngs of unmasked intruders who wandered through hallways and into private offices may also have transformed the riot into a super-spreader event. The coronavirus thrives indoors, particularly in crowded spaces, lingering in the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If even a few of the pro-Trump extremists were infected — likely, given the current rates of spread and the crowd size — then the virus would have had the ideal opportunity to find new victims, experts said. It has all the elements of what we warn people about, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. People yelling and screaming, chanting, exerting themselves — all of those things provide opportunity for the virus to spread, and this virus takes those opportunities. President Trump has downplayed the pandemic almost since its beginning, and many of his supporters who entered the Capitol yesterday did not appear to be wearing masks or making any effort at social distancing.

Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year.

{"original": "A new Labor Department rule would classify gig workers as contractors. Construction is among the industries that may be affected by a Labor Department rule on criteria for employee status. Credit... James Tensuan for The New York Times The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule that could classify millions of workers in industries like construction, cleaning and the gig economy as contractors rather than employees, another step under the Trump administration toward endorsing the business practices of companies like Uber and Lyft. Companies don't have to pay contractors a minimum wage or overtime and don't have to pay a share of contractors' Social Security taxes or contribute to unemployment insurance on their behalf. By contrast, companies that hire employees must provide them with those benefits and protections, which can raise labor costs 20 to 30 percent, according to estimates from industry officials. This rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, the labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, said in a statement, adding that the rule makes it easier to identify legitimate employees while recognizing and respecting the entrepreneurial spirit of workers who choose to pursue the freedom associated with being an independent contractor. The rule is scheduled to take effect on March 8, which will allow the incoming Biden administration to postpone it and perhaps set it aside.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Many Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.", "augmented": []}

In anticipation of approval, the vaccine, called CoronaVac, has already been shipped around the world as countries prepare for mass inoculation campaigns.

Jovelle Tamayo for The New York Times Until March, when everything started tasting like cardboard, Katherine Hansen had such a keen sense of smell that she could recreate almost any restaurant dish at home without the recipe, just by recalling the odors. Then the coronavirus arrived. One of Ms. Hansen's first symptoms was a loss of smell, and then of taste. Ms. Hansen still cannot taste food, and says she can't even tolerate chewing it. Now she lives mostly on soups and shakes. I'm like someone who loses their eyesight as an adult, said Ms. Hansen, a real estate agent who lives outside Seattle. They know what something should look like. I know what it should taste like, but I can't get there. A diminished sense of smell, called anosmia, is recognized as one of the telltale symptoms of Covid-19, often the first, and sometimes the only one. Frequently accompanied by an inability to taste, anosmia occurs abruptly and dramatically in Covid, almost as if a switch has been flipped. Most patients regain their senses of smell and taste after they recover, usually within weeks. But in a minority of patients like Ms. Hansen, the loss persists, and doctors cannot say when or if the senses will return.", "augmented": []}

When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes. However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider, and I cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of these electors. [hitting gavel] On this vote, the yeas are six, the nays are 93. The objection is not sustained. The secretary will notify the House of the action of the Senate, informing that body that the Senate is now ready to proceed to joint session with further counting of the electoral vote for president and vice president. For what reason does the gentleman from Pennsylvania rise? Mr. President, sadly but resolutely, I object to the electoral votes of my beloved Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on the grounds of multiple constitutional infractions that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given. And on this occasion, I have a written objection signed by a senator and 80 members of the House of Representatives.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The extent to which Mr. Trump is willing to go in that effort became fully apparent on Saturday, when he called Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Republican secretary of state and a Republican, urging him to find votes and recalculate the results of the state's presidential contest in his favor, ignoring the official finding, already certified by the governor, that he had lost. It was the culmination of efforts to overturn the election that began nearly two months ago. At every turn, Mr. Raffensperger and other Georgia election officials have debunked the conspiracy theories about voter fraud pushed by the president and his allies. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump renewed his attacks again Tuesday night, baselessly claiming in a tweet that a a big 'voter dump' against the Republican candidates was forthcoming. The short-term effect of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign will become evident as the votes are counted in the runoffs pitting David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Republicans fighting to keep their Senate seats, against two Democrats, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. For Republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that Mr. Trump's effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout in the runoffs, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself is rigged and cannot be trusted. Bill Crane, a Georgia political operative and commentator, said the president's tactics, as well as the work of activists in the state who have claimed the general election was rigged, were tamping down Republican turnout.", "augmented": []}

Mr. Warnock's victory over the Republican incumbent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, represented a landmark breakthrough for African-Americans in politics as well as for Georgia: He is the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South. For Democrats to take the Senate, which is crucial to enacting President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s first-term agenda, they will also need to win Georgia's other Senate runoff. Votes are still being counted in that race between the Republican candidate, David Perdue, and his Democratic rival, Jon Ossoff, with Mr. Ossoff appearing to hold a narrow edge.

Biden Jr. said Wednesday. It's disorder. It's chaos. It borders on sedition. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Wednesday's mob attack on the Capitol borders on sedition. The National Association of Manufacturers took out the qualifier: This is sedition, it said in a statement that accused President Trump of having incited violence in an attempt to retain power. And within the first hour of the attack, Merriam-Webster reported, sedition was at the top of its searches, ahead of coup d'état, insurrection and putsch. To many scholars and historians, the use of the word sedition — defined as incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority — was not misplaced. Treason, traitor, terrorism, sedition — these are strong words with specific meanings that are often tossed aside in favor of their buzzword impact, Joanne Freeman, a historian at Yale University, said in an email. But meanings matter. And sometimes, those words apply. But did it apply on Wednesday? Geoffrey R. Stone, a legal scholar at the University of Chicago, said that might have been the case. Normally, it refers to speech that advocates action or beliefs that are designed to overthrow or undermine the lawful processes of government, he said of the strict definition of sedition.

The intraparty brawl prompted by the election challenges was a situation Mr. McConnell had feared and that had prompted him to initially refrain from recognizing Mr. Biden's victory for weeks after November's election, wary of inflaming Mr. Trump's grievances with his party. When he did recognize Mr. Biden, his critics argued that the acknowledgment came too late, and that by waiting silently, Mr. McConnell had allowed Mr. Trump to sow dangerous disinformation with millions of Republican voters, drawing the backing of elected officials in his own party. On Wednesday, Mr. McConnell said he had seen enough. It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American voters and overrule the courts and the states on this thin basis, he said.

The viral lineage leading to B.1.1.7 has accumulated 23 mutations. Of particular concern to scientists are eight mutations that affect the gene for a protein called spike on the surface of coronaviruses. That's because the viruses use the spike protein to grab onto human cells. It's possible that one or more of them help B.1.1.7 invade cells more successfully. One of these mutations, known as N501Y, is particularly worrisome. Experiments have demonstrated that it enables the virus to bind to cells more tightly. And it has also arisen in other lineages of the coronavirus, including a variant identified in South Africa in December. That variant, called B.1.351, rapidly spread through the country, and has spread to a dozen other countries so far. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch ran an experiment to see if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine worked against viruses with the N501Y mutation. They found that in cells in the lab, the mutant virus could not infect human cells mixed with antibodies from vaccinated people. The antibodies latched onto the coronaviruses and blocked them from grabbing into cells. Despite the N501Y mutation, the experiment showed, the vaccine-generated antibodies were still able to latch onto the viruses.", "augmented": []}

It is hard to say how long it will take to count all of them. Credit... Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times All eyes were on mail-in ballots when general election results were tallied in November. And now, with control of the Senate hinging on two runoff elections in Georgia, it is no surprise that mail-in ballots are getting attention again. Here is what we know about when they will be counted: Mail-in ballots could not be counted before the polls closed, even if they arrived before election day. But many ballots have already been processed, meaning envelope signatures and addresses have been verified, though the tallying of the votes themselves only began Tuesday night. Of course, it is hard to say how long it will take for all of the mail-in ballots to be counted. First, some mail-in ballots may not have been received yet. Although most Georgians had to get their ballots in by the time the polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern, military and overseas voters have three additional days for their ballots to be received, as long as they mailed them by Tuesday. Second, some counties will count their mail-in ballots faster than others. So when will all the mail-in ballots actually be counted? Only time will tell. Read more", "augmented": []}

Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via AP Images The chief of the United States Capitol Police will resign Jan. 16, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Thursday, one day after the agency was roundly criticized for failing to protect the Capitol from a violent incursion by extremists loyal to President Trump. The chief, Steven A. Sund, made the decision hours after Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, had called on him to resign. Mr. Sund, he hasn't even called us since this happened, Ms. Pelosi said. The Capitol Police officers' union also had called for Mr. Sund to step down. Mr. Sund had been the chief of the Capitol Police since June 2019, and had previously served with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington for more than 25 years. As Capitol Police chief, he oversaw more than 2,300 officers and civilian employees responsible for protecting Congress and the building itself. But the destruction on Wednesday, when a mob incited by Mr. Trump stormed into the Capitol, prompted outrage, anger and fear among members of Congress who demanded to know why the police had not been more prepared. Many also questioned why many of those who had broken into the building had been allowed to leave without being arrested. Read more", "augmented": []}

We must adopt a new, more positive, Jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. But first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of Jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of Jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. The famed Yiddisher cup (khop)---Jewish head--is only half full: the typical Jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of Judaism. We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. To do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over Jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our Jewish youth.", "augmented": []}

Officials in the two cities, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai, told residents on Friday to stay at home for seven days to prevent further spread of an outbreak that has caused 349 reported infections in the past week, mostly in Shijiazhuang. Residents of Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million that is scheduled to host several events for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, were barred earlier this week from leaving the city. Major highways have been blocked, train and bus stations closed and most flights canceled. On Saturday, subway, bus and taxi services were also suspended. Millions of people across Hebei have been tested in recent days, while people who recently traveled to Shijiazhuang and Xingtai are being scrutinized.

Jeenah Moon for The New York Times The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, the American flagship of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire, denounced President Trump on Thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, declaring his behavior impeachable and encouraging Mr. Trump to resign his office to prevent a second impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House. In an unsigned article titled Donald Trump's Final Days, the Journal's editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election and said this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure. If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign, the Journal wrote, concluding, It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly. The Journal's editorial page, led by the editor Paul Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly. But its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president by a news outlet controlled by Mr. Murdoch, whose Fox News cable network is home to several of Mr. Trump's most loyal and longstanding media defenders.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The incidence of new coronavirus cases was generally declining in early August, the researchers said, though rates among adults aged 18 to 22 were on the rise. Infection rates went on falling — by an average of 18 percent — where large universities chose to teach remotely, the researchers found, but the rates shot up where in-person instruction was underway. The researchers did not take account of whether students were physically present on campus, even if classes were being held remotely, Dr. Lisa Barrios, a member of the C.D.C. 's Covid-19 response team, pointed out. As a result, she said, it was hard to know whether the large decreases in remote-learning counties happened because fewer students were physically present, or because the universities did other things as well, like impose rigorous mask mandates and bans on social gatherings. The study also compared counties with large universities teaching in person against counties less than 500 miles away with about the same total population but no large university, and found similarly sharp differences in virus incidence: an 80 percent rise in the university counties, versus a drop of nearly 20 percent in the others. Dr. Barrios urged universities to increase testing when students return to campus and make adequate provisions to isolate and quarantine infected and exposed students. Students and staff members who catch the virus may increase the risks to people off campus, particularly those who are older or have underlying health problems.

Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from implementing a rule, set to take effect next week, that would have closed the doors of the United States to most asylum seekers. The sweeping clampdown on asylum would have prevented a large swath of people from qualifying for protection in the United States by narrowing eligibility. Applicants who had not first sought asylum in a transit country through which they had passed; had lived in the United States for a year without permission or had claimed persecution based on sexual orientation would be disqualified. Though President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. could take action to reverse the policy once in office, it would take several months to undo it because it had already been finalized. Judge James Donato of the U.S. District Court for Northern California issued a nationwide injunction on procedural grounds, saying that the acting Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, lacked authority to impose the rule because he had not been properly confirmed for his position.

Pete Marovich for The New York Times The threat to impeach President Trump in his final days in office raises political, constitutional and logistical questions rarely contemplated in American history: No president has ever been impeached twice or after already losing re-election. Here are four key things to know: There is nothing preventing a second impeachment. The House impeached Mr. Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the Senate acquitted him. No American president has ever been impeached twice. But there appears to be nothing in the Constitution stopping Congress from impeaching again on a new set of charges. The timing is tight, but not impossible. Past presidential impeachments have typically been drawn-out affairs with investigations, hearings and weeks of public debate, but that is not required. If Democrats and some Republicans are in agreement, they can bypass the House Judiciary Committee and move in a matter of days to draw up charges and proceed directly to a debate and vote on the floor of the House. Then, if the House votes to adopt articles of impeachment, they can immediately transmit them to the Senate, which must promptly begin a trial.

Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times The United States reported at least 291,300 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, a single-day record but one that is inflated because of delays in reporting over the holidays. Nineteen states reported no data on Friday, which was a public holiday for New Year's Day. The remaining states reported a total of more than 147,000 new cases on Friday. The near doubling of cases on Saturday can mostly be explained by many states reporting cases for both Friday and Saturday, with one state, Michigan, reporting cases for Thursday as well. Other states will wait until Sunday or Monday to report cases from the past few days, which will continue to distort the totals. Regular data reporting is expected to resume toward the end of next week. The country's previous single-day record, according to a New York Times database, was 280,514 new cases on Dec. 11, though that number was also inflated because of 43,000 cases that were added from a backlog in Texas. The highest number of new cases in a single day without any data anomalies was 251,191 on Dec. 18.

Whichever party wins that race will control the Senate. After Mr. Biden's triumph in November, Mr. Warnock's victory provides yet another comeuppance for the Trumpist politics that have come to define the Republican Party over the past four years. Ms. Loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line Trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. In recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with Mr. Trump in Northwest Georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to Mr. Biden when Congress meets on Wednesday. Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, with each pair often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia, where the church is a pillar of many communities.

Cuomo of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, both of whom have clashed with President Trump — imploring the current administration to release all available doses to the states as soon as possible. The failure to distribute these doses to states who request them is unconscionable and unacceptable, the governors wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times and sent Friday to the secretary of health, Alex M. Azar II, and Gen. Gustave F. Perna, who is in charge of vaccine distribution. We demand that the federal government begin distributing these reserved doses to states immediately, the letter said. Mr. Biden's promise of 100 million shots in arms is an ambitious one, and the Trump administration's rocky rollout — which Mr. Biden called a travesty on Friday — has not made his task any easier. As of Thursday, the Trump administration had shipped more than 21 million vaccine doses, and millions more were already in the federal government's hands. Yet only 5.9 million people had received a dose. State and local public health officials, already overwhelmed with rising infections, have been struggling to administer the vaccine to hospital workers and at-risk older Americans while most people remain in the dark about when they might be protected.", "augmented": []}

But the rule could still have a substantial impact because employers often base their labor practices on the department's approach. Determinations of employee status typically hinge on several factors, but the department's rule elevates two: how much control an employer exerts over the worker, and the extent to which a worker can increase his or her hourly income through entrepreneurial savvy rather than earning a set wage. Critics have argued that there is no legal basis for elevating these two factors above others, such as the degree of skill involved in the work or whether the work is indefinite or temporary, and that the approach will deny employee status to many who deserve it.", "augmented": []}

Officials in the two cities, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai, told residents on Friday to stay at home for seven days to prevent further spread of an outbreak that has caused 349 reported infections in the past week, mostly in Shijiazhuang. Residents of Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million that is scheduled to host several events for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, were barred earlier this week from leaving the city. Major highways have been blocked, train and bus stations closed and most flights canceled. On Saturday, subway, bus and taxi services were also suspended. Millions of people across Hebei have been tested in recent days, while people who recently traveled to Shijiazhuang and Xingtai are being scrutinized.

On Capitol Hill, the number of Republicans willing to publicly defend Mr. Trump dwindled. One, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, said he supported the invocation of the 25th Amendment; another, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, said he would not oppose the move if cabinet members decided to proceed.

Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.'

Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about.

{"original": "The big dip in mortality shown in the trial of about 800 patients has caught some experts by surprise. Other studies testing the effects of tocilizumab and sarilumab have ended in disappointment, showing little to no benefit in people hospitalized for Covid-19. Because all treatment trials are run with their own quirks and patient populations, it's difficult to compare across different studies, said Dr. Emma Kaplan-Lewis, an infectious-disease physician at NYC Health + Hospitals who has helped to conduct trials on tocilizumab, including one that showed no improvement in patient survival. She was not involved in the new study. My general impression is that tocilizumab and sarilumab do work for some patients, Dr. Kaplan-Lewis added. But there is a sweet spot — it's not for everybody, at all times. While many treatments for Covid-19 target the coronavirus itself, drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab work to quiet the immune system which, when triggered by an infection, can overreact and start to destroy the body's own tissues. This immunological friendly fire is thought to fan the flames of many of the most serious cases of Covid-19. Although the new study has not yet been vetted by experts for formal publication, its findings were compelling enough to prompt a shift in guidance in Britain, where officials have partnered with Roche, a manufacturer of tocilizumab, to keep hospitals stocked with the drug.", "augmented": []}

Credit... Nic Antaya/Getty Images Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that it sold about two million cars and light trucks last year, a decline of 15 percent from 2019, roughly in line with the broader auto industry. The coronavirus pandemic sharply slowed sales for automakers as people stayed away from dealerships and companies were forced to shut down factories for nearly two months last spring. Ford's sales were also affected by company's decision to phase out most sedans, including the Fusion and Fiesta, from its U.S. lineup. Ford said sales in the fourth quarter fell 10 percent. Cars made up just 7 percent of total sales; the rest were trucks and sport-utility vehicles. The company said its shift to focus on larger vehicles is paying off. Sales of sport utility vehicles, which generate much more profit for automakers than sedans, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Ford began selling a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck, which has long been the top selling vehicle in the United States. The transition to the new model caused a temporary shortage of pickups that slowed sales. Ford's sales of F-series trucks — including the F-150 and larger versions — fell 12 percent in 2020.", "augmented": []}

At his news conference, Mr. Cuomo said he still believed state and local officials needed to prioritize health care workers. He blamed the slow pace of vaccination on hospitals, saying they had been slow to accelerate the rate at which they were inoculating their workers. In an effort to boost the vaccination rate, the state will allow the vaccine to be distributed outside hospitals, including at private doctor's offices, local health departments, ambulatory centers and pharmacies, all of which will require appointments to distribute vaccines.

A year later, Assad's army launched a chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people.

In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump. The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office. This is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."}

A year later, Assad's army launched a chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people.

In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated. They warn that an American departure will weaken U.S. influence in the region and may embolden Russia, Iran and Turkey, who are also on the ground. The other worry?"}

Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials, according to the person with knowledge of the events. Kash Patel, the chief of staff to Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary, responded: The acting secretary and the president have spoken multiple times this week about the request for National Guard personnel in D.C. During these conversations, the president conveyed to the acting secretary that he should take any necessary steps to support civilian law enforcement requests in securing the Capitol and federal buildings. The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard, an Army official said Wednesday, and Virginia's governor dispatched members of the Virginia Guard along with 200 Virginia State Troopers to quell the violence in the nation's capital."}

{"original": "The arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower Mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, Sellian, and Priya Rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. Grace Nakamura, an adjudicator for the Immigration and Refugee Board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, Kumi. The latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a Greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. It's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: Bala vilifies the Canadian Border Services Agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, Stephen Harper, and sings the praises of the Canadian Tamil Congress, which appears here as the Tamil Alliance."}

{"original": "The next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran's malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it's carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies."}

{"original": "Trump's problem is that, until Thursday, that's what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region."}
{"original": "Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst."}
{"original": "The day after Iranian missile struck bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, Republicans and Democrats in Congress split sharply over the president's approach on Iran and the way forward. Amid back-to-back classified briefings by top administration officials for members of the House and Senate, most Republicans praised Mr. Trump effusively on Wednesday for targeting General Suleimani and for his restraint in responding to Iran's action."}
{"original": "The result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride."}
{"original": "The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built."}

The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust.

The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends."}

Pete Marovich for The New York Times Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump's account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington. Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump's tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. Facebook later said it had assessed two policy violations against Mr. Trump's page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. Twitter said it was acting as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C. This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets, the company said on Twitter.
