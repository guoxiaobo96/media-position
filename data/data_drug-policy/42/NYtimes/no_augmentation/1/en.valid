How businesses are being linked with this gambit. The senators rejecting the election count include Steve Daines of Montana, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Roger Marshall of Kansas, who ran and won their seats in 2020. Their major campaign contributors included corporate political action committees, which collect and distribute employee contributions, based on data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Here are some examples:
The troops were sent to the D.C. Armory to be deployed to the Capitol and to other points around Washington. Read more
In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.
The senators have suggested that they would impose cost-benefit analysis requirements on America's financial regulators. No important rule could be passed without establishing that the dollar impositions on the financial industry would not be outweighed by the dollar benefits created by the rule.
Battered by a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, local jails and state prison systems around the United States have resorted to a drastic strategy to keep the virus at bay: Shutting down completely and transferring their inmates elsewhere.
But scientists say the new guidelines are based on the latest science. A large clinical trial studied hundreds of British children at risk for peanut allergies, giving them either peanut-containing food regularly from infancy or withholding all foods with peanuts.
The move to reverse course on Mr. Trump's promised swift withdrawal picked up in recent days, even as Mr. Bolton worked to avoid openly confronting the president the way Mr. Mattis did. On Friday, in a briefing for reporters about a forthcoming trip to the Middle East by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a senior State Department official said there was no fixed timetable for the American withdrawal.
As a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing, if need be, he said. I believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life. But he's rightly prepared to protect American lives and interests.
In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point's enrollment.
It is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which happen to be its competitors. In November, for instance, two women sued Uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in Florida and California. And last month an Uber driver in Beirut, Lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of Rebecca Dykes, a British diplomat.
As a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing, if need be, he said. I believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life. But he's rightly prepared to protect American lives and interests.

Members of Congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward, Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. Our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient War Powers Act notification and by the administration's briefing today.
In December, President Trump made an extraordinary declaration about U.S. involvement in Syria: We have won against ISIS. Now, it's time for our troops to come back home. Ignoring advice from his generals and advisers, Trump said that the U.S. would leave Syria. Defense Department officials said that they were ordered to do it within 30 days. [explosion] Then came a flurry of criticism, even from inside his own party. I believe it is a catastrophic mistake. This is very disappointing. It needs to be reconsidered. Then, the resignations. First, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis quit. And America's chief diplomat in the fight against ISIS, Brett McGurk, soon followed. Now, the timeline for a full withdrawal is unclear. I never said we're doing it that quickly. He went on to say that the U.S. will leave at a proper pace while continuing to fight ISIS, a shift from — They're all coming back, and they're coming back now. The nearly eight-year-long war in Syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. [explosion] So, how did we get here and what are U.S. forces doing in Syria? In 2011, uprisings rippled through the Middle East. Leaders fell in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. And after months of anti-government protests in Syria, the U.S. had a message for President Bashar al-Assad: This morning, President Obama called on Assad to step aside. He didn't and the conflict escalated. In 2012, Obama warned Assad against using Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons against his own people.
We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war, Mr. Trump said. The president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. But his policy toward Iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.
I grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda, he told me in early February, explaining why he wanted to get the most value out of philanthropy. We were sitting in the East Village office of the Economic Security Project, an organization Mr. Hughes co-founded with two other activists, Dorian Warren and Natalie Foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income Americans.
WASHINGTON — Under increasing pressure to defend the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq, senior Trump administration officials offered new justifications but little detail on Tuesday, citing threats to the American Embassy in Baghdad and intelligence suggesting other imminent attacks that helped prompt the strike.
Wayfair, the furniture and home goods e-commerce business, said on Thursday that all of its U.S. employees would be paid at least $15 an hour. The increase, which took effect on Sunday, applies to full-time, part-time and seasonal employees. More than 40 percent of Wayfair's hourly workers across its U.S. supply chain and customer service operations received a pay bump.
But no: Washington was obsessed with debt. The Simpson-Bowles report was the talk of the town. Paul Ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. And between the capital's debt obsession, the Republican takeover of the House, and a hard right turn in state governments, America was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.
The move may inspire some ISIS fighters to return to Syria.
The trial's results were very very unambiguous, said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, chairman of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's food allergy committee and one of the authors of the new guidelines. The fact that the guidelines changed over time makes them more credible, not less, he said.
It's worth asking whether the major internet properties should revise their rules for him and other people with large online followings who regularly spread bogus or harmful information.
Just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.
That age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.
The Democrats have to deal with Robert Byrd and his nattering little rule that hasn't gone away, said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at McDermott+Consulting and a former health aide to Senator Chuck Grassley who worked on reconciliation bills during his Senate tenure.
Thomas Wright, an Irish-born expert on America at the Brookings Institution, said that People are worried for real that Trump will come back. The months since the election have shown people just how bad a second term would have been — the guardrails off, a completely personalized government and giving voice to his authoritarian tendencies, he said.
By contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017.
The notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. They were designed to United States Customs and Border Protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. Aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture.
They could include a measure finalized this week to restrict the type of scientific studies the Environmental Protection Agency can use to develop new air and water protections, and another granting liability protection to companies that accidentally kill migratory birds.
Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance giant, said on Tuesday that it had stopped selling properties to the firm, Vision Property Management, after conducting a review of the firm's rent-to-own program, which operates in more than a dozen states.
Grace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. Mr. Ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. He continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life.
The lawyer, Cleta Mitchell, has been advising Mr. Trump despite a policy at her firm, Foley & Lardner, that none of its lawyers should represent clients involved in relitigating the presidential election.
But when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.
While national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. For starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. As a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.
In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.
The Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty.
Mr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast.
Pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the president had shown patience and prudence.
We would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.
In December, President Trump made an extraordinary declaration about U.S. involvement in Syria: We have won against ISIS. Now, it's time for our troops to come back home.

The utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. In addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to California's energy sector.
Both the Senate and House would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. Most of those calling for Mr. Trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were Democrats, but there were some exceptions. Governor Phil Scott, Republican of Vermont, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump should be ousted. The fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress. Read more
Today's Rampage at the Capitol, as It Happened Congress returned to the Senate chamber to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory hours after thousands of protesters took part in what Mitch McConnell labeled a failed insurrection. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:57 - 0:00 transcript 'Protesters Are in The Building': How an Electoral Count Turned Into Chaos As Congress met to certify the election results, President Trump held a simultaneous rally. Watch these moments unfold side by side to see how his speech incited a mob that broke into the Capitol. And the fight begins today. And we need to march on the Capitol today — Let's have trial by combat. Let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. God bless you, and God bless America. We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history: whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election. All of us take our responsibility seriously. Let's go! I would urge my colleagues, don't take perhaps the easy path. And the Electoral College is the mechanism by which the people select the president. But if Congress gets to decide which states get to vote in the Electoral College, then clearly, Congress is selecting the president, not the people. On the steps of the back side of the Capitol, we're seeing protesters overcome the police. The police are now running back into the Capitol building. Take that House! Take it now!
The Trump administration has also rushed in recent weeks to lock in weak pollution rules.
One of the biggest firms in the rent-to-own home business is now on the federal government's do-not-sell list.
President Trump ordered the strike directly, prompted by the death of an American contractor on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Iraqi Shia militia. Mr. Trump did not bother to consult congressional leaders. As with his other displays of martial fiat, his immediate impulse was probably to shock the liberal domestic audience, vicariously make himself feel tough, and assert raw executive power by going around the normal channels of decision making.

Mr. Ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual.

In his new book, Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn, out this week, Mr. Hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and Facebook's success — technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms — have created a winner takes all economy in which only a small group of people succeed.
A progressive Democrat could wield the powers of the Commerce Department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.
Mr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. The social network's colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes's career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.
The voters have spoken, said Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah, in a statement also signed by some Democratic colleagues. Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.

As police led the members down stairwells and into the subterranean maze of tunnels to a secure location, Mr. Crow said he called his wife, who had been watching the terrifying scene on television from Colorado. Mr. Crow said lawmakers were determined to resume their work in the Capitol on Wednesday night, if possible, once the buildings were cleared of remaining threats. We want to go back and finish the business of the people to show that we are a democracy, and that the government is stronger than any mob, he said. Read more

I must emphasize, the results of the past election absolutely do not represent that the will of the people at the grass-roots level seeks to give up our sovereignty, she said in a New Year's Day address. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory that must be united with the mainland, by force if necessary.
From these grade-school negotiations Mr. Silverbush acquired some valuable information. I knew from second grade that I wanted to be a lawyer, he said.
U.S. officials said General Suleimani had been hit in a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport. He was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades, the NYT notes. (Here's a smart long read on his importance.)
The challenge isn't expected to delay the inauguration on Jan. 20, but it turns a routine process into a political showdown. Those who spoke up against the move did so in stark terms:
Jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. ET Washington, D.C. mayor issues order extending emergency for 15 days. Supporters of President Donald Trump climb up the side of the Capitol to enter in protest. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Wednesday night issued an order extending the city's public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support President Trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation's capital. The order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety. The directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20. It came hours after Ms. Bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday. In a statement explaining the extension, Ms. Bowser pointed to the pro-Trump protesters who came to the city for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns, Ms. Bowser wrote. They have breached the security of the Capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the Capitol.
That's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. A year later, Assad's army launched a chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] In response, the U.S. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. But a new threat was also emerging — ISIS. In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated. They warn that an American departure will weaken U.S. influence in the region and may embolden Russia, Iran and Turkey, who are also on the ground. The other worry?
The prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last October along the United States border near San Diego. The petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, MAGA (the acronym recalls the President's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as a major Land Art exhibition of significant cultural value.
The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the Administration for Children and Families, declined to speculate on Southwest Key's grants. In response to a question asking if the agency had a plan if the charity were to lose its grants, a spokeswoman said the agency was always planning for unforeseen events.
Why do this with only about two weeks left in President Trump's term? Because we must defend our democracy for all Americans, now. And we must preserve our democracy for future Americans. We must ensure a field of potential Republican presidential hopefuls in 2024 who have integrity. And we must reassure the world, and especially would-be authoritarian regimes, about what United States policy will be on questions of freedom and self-rule now and in the future.
First, Vice President Pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment in order to make a declaration that Mr. Trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This would immediately suspend, but not remove, Mr. Trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint Mr. Pence as acting president. The 25th Amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.
The increases closely follow growing prosperity in China that began in the 1980s as Beijing embraced market economics after decades of isolation. In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first companies allowed into the country, and ILSI arrived soon afterward. Seeking to identify influential scientists it could work with, the group found a partner in Chen Chunming, a leading nutritionist who was the founding president of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the forerunner of China's C.D.C.
Not that the border crisis is one of Mr. Trump's self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. It may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president's nurturing, become something far more tragic.
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican, circulated a 21-page memo to House colleagues explaining why the move sets an exceptionally dangerous precedent.
Facebook and Twitter temporarily locked President Trump's accounts this week after he inspired the rampage on the Capitol, and they are considering permanent bans.
U.S. officials said General Suleimani had been hit in a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport. He was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades, the NYT notes. (Here's a smart long read on his importance.)
He doesn't want to get entangled. But he doesn't want to look weak, said Professor Cohn, adding that her opinions did not necessarily represent those of the Defense Department.
The president's mercurial approach to Iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including European NATO allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Arab nations in the Persian Gulf region uncertain about Mr. Trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from Iran.
Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.
When Iranian operatives blew holes in oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June and launched drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities in September, Mr. Trump opted in both cases against a direct, immediate military response. Still, one day after the drone strike targeting General Suleimani, the Pentagon announced it was sending around 3,000 more troops to Kuwait as a precaution against growing threats to American forces in the region.
There are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building.

She said the industry efforts have been wildly successful, in part because China lacks a free media or watchdog organizations that might have been critical of the relationship.
Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.

Some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. And we were mostly right. Why only mostly? Because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. The obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.
The fabric feels cheap, though. I hate the fabric. I hate the fit. They squeeze my thighs when I pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. They are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. And yet, beginning in September, I have been wearing them at least three times a week.
But Mr. Johnson held his tongue until Sunday evening, after he returned to London. Even then, he issued a carefully worded four-paragraph statement that said he would not lament the killing of the general, Qassim Suleimani, warned Iran against reprisals and said nothing about Mr. Trump's action.
By the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.
While national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. For starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly.

Officials said on Friday that the acting defense secretary, Christopher C. Miller, had ordered the redeployment of the ship in part as a de-escalatory signal to Tehran to avoid stumbling into a crisis in President Trump's waning days in office. American intelligence reports indicate that Iran and its proxies may be preparing a strike as early as this weekend to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Twitter, taking a harder line, locks President Trump's account. Facebook does the same. President Donald Trump's taped message from the White House was removed by Twitter. Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump's account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington. Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump's tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. Facebook later said it had assessed two policy violations against Mr. Trump's page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. Twitter said it was acting as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C. This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets, the company said on Twitter. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked. The tweets that were removed repeated Mr. Trump's false claims of election fraud and expressed praise and sympathy for those who had forced their way into the Capitol and disrupted Congress's certification of the election results.
Though the weeks ahead may be some of the hardest yet, he said he believed Britain was entering the last phase of the struggle, because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favor of the British people.
Twitter also removed a video in which Mr. Trump repeated his baseless claim that the election was stolen and advised the mob to go home, while adding, We love you. Read more
Passage of much major legislation, however, requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, so Democrats would still be forced to compromise with Republicans and would be limited in their ability to pass sweeping new laws, said Robert Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had considered taking out General Suleimani but rejected it — not for lack of nerve, but for fear of undue escalation and an unnecessary war with Iran. The fundamental facts on the ground have not changed, and in the kind of robust interagency, national security decision-making process that the National Security Council staff is supposed to supervise, such concerns would have been systematically raised, dissected and discussed, and a consensus reached to inform presidential action. No such process seems to have occurred here.
Several said it was improperly classified, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called it vague and unacceptably unspecific. Lawmakers pressed for more answers on Tuesday at an intelligence briefing by administration officials.
He was not. Everybody was at a laptop wearing headphones, Mr. Glanville said. He strode inside, unplugged the device that provided free Wi-Fi and tossed it into a bin in his office.
Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
In 1993, Ms. Chen became the head of ILSA-China and she remained a senior adviser to the organization until her death last year. Professors Greenhalgh and Popkin said that Ms. Chen was instrumental in stymying attempts to address soaring obesity by stressing the harmful impact of consuming highly processed food and sugary soft drinks.
From California to Missouri to Pennsylvania, state and local officials say that so many guards have fallen ill with the virus and are unable to work that abruptly closing some correctional facilities is the only way to maintain community security and prisoner safety.
A Southwest Key spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the Office of Refugee Resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from Texas, Arizona or California. He said the charity was focused on providing the best care possible for children.

The president's mercurial approach to Iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including European NATO allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Arab nations in the Persian Gulf region uncertain about Mr. Trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from Iran.
Even before polls closed on Tuesday, senior Republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of Mr. Trump's denial.
The compassionate lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. The novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. Bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the small of things, hands, wounded children — all designed to elicit sympathy. Stock characters crowd the narrative. One of them, Grace's world-weary colleague Mitchell Hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. Bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (there can be a gap between policy and practice) to Border Services (the agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country's official boundaries).
President Trump ordered the strike directly, prompted by the death of an American contractor on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Iraqi Shia militia. Mr. Trump did not bother to consult congressional leaders. As with his other displays of martial fiat, his immediate impulse was probably to shock the liberal domestic audience, vicariously make himself feel tough, and assert raw executive power by going around the normal channels of decision making.
It's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.

The group of senators, led by Ted Cruz of Texas, will call for an emergency audit of election results in disputed states, without citing specific evidence of fraud. (There's also Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had already promised to dispute the result.) Scores of Republican House members also plan to reject the count, attracting strong condemnation and setting off infighting in the party. And companies whose political arms donated to these lawmakers' campaigns now face accusations of funding their maneuvers.

The woman has not been identified and no information has been released about who may have shot her. Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department said earlier that she was a civilian and that his officers were leading the investigation. The woman was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for the police department, said in an email. Mr. Sternbeck said he did not yet know who shot her or have any other details. A video posted to Twitter earlier on Wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the Capitol. The woman in the video seemed to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. The woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. A man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of police could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her. Where's she hit?

Congress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the Affordable Care Act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. One priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help. Another is rewriting formulas to peg the size of the subsidy to a more generous health insurance plan, a way to increase the amount of assistance.

To do this, the cabinet and Congress must deploy the 25th Amendment and impeachment in sequence.
Both the Senate and House would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. Most of those calling for Mr. Trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were Democrats, but there were some exceptions. Governor Phil Scott, Republican of Vermont, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump should be ousted. The fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress. Read more
LOS ANGELES — As California's deadliest wildfire was consuming the town of Paradise in November, some of the state's top power company officials and a dozen legislators were at an annual retreat at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort on Maui. In the course of four days, they discussed wildfires — and how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the devastation, if any.

The prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last October along the United States border near San Diego. The petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, MAGA (the acronym recalls the President's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as a major Land Art exhibition of significant cultural value.
There are six areas of health policy where congressional aides and health policy experts could see Democrats focusing their efforts this year. Smaller policy reforms are expected to be easier, both legally and politically, while more ambitious policies may not easily slot into reconciliation's strict rules — or the political preferences of enough Democratic lawmakers.
According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that's what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.
The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the Administration for Children and Families, declined to speculate on Southwest Key's grants.

He doesn't want to get entangled. But he doesn't want to look weak, said Professor Cohn, adding that her opinions did not necessarily represent those of the Defense Department.
The result, he said, was a new kind of compromise. We did not try to negotiate the lowest common denominator but consciously tried to unite the best of both worlds, Mr. Kurz said. That's how it is possible that both the Greens could keep their central campaign promises and so could the People's Party.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Rattled but defiant, members of Congress returned to the Capitol on Wednesday night to resume counting the electoral votes from the November election, a process that leaders on both sides of the aisle said would not be derailed by the earlier siege of the building by President Trump's supporters. This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said as the Senate reconvened. Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the majority leader after Democrats won both of Tuesday's runoffs in Georgia, said that January 6, 2021, was a date that would live in infamy, invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt's phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. He called Mr. Trump's supporters who stormed the building goons and thugs. Moments earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the rioters unhinged and referred to the siege as a failed insurrection. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation, he said.

Democrats stepped up their criticism of intelligence that the administration provided immediately after the drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen.

The administration's formal notification to Congress, which remains classified, provided no information on future threats or the imminent attack, officials who have read it said.
That's the message I take from Olivier Blanchard's presidential address to the American Economic Association. To be fair, Blanchard — one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the I.M.F. — was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all MMT and say that debt never matters. But his analysis nonetheless makes the Fix the Debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump. The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office. This is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.

The phrase Jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides American foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in Mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, American foreign policy tends to work.

Critics of the killing worry that it will cause huge trouble for the U.S. and allies like Israel, including putting America closer to war with Iran.

Realizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. Their goal: a California law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates.

One possible outcome is that a spooked Iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. Suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the Islamic Republic's thinking, says the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad. For 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. It may now take its time to reassess that view.

WASHINGTON — Under increasing pressure to defend the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq, senior Trump administration officials offered new justifications but little detail on Tuesday, citing threats to the American Embassy in Baghdad and intelligence suggesting other imminent attacks that helped prompt the strike.
But Mr. Johnson held his tongue until Sunday evening, after he returned to London. Even then, he issued a carefully worded four-paragraph statement that said he would not lament the killing of the general, Qassim Suleimani, warned Iran against reprisals and said nothing about Mr. Trump's action.

One such action kept in place Obama-era standards on smog-causing emissions that, even when originally issued, fell short of the standard recommended by public health experts. Another imposed the federal government's first regulation to control planet-warming pollution from airplanes but did not require airlines to go beyond emissions limits that they had set for themselves. And a third updates regulations around lead pipes in a way that environmental critics said falls far short of an overhaul needed to ensure safe drinking water.

William Reinsch, the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Biden and his team had placed a lot of emphasis on competing more effectively with China, including efforts to augment American industry that could be run through the Commerce Department.
Second, the House should quickly draw up and pass articles of impeachment. And then the Senate should hold a fair — but immediate and efficient — trial both to remove President Trump from office and, as important, to disqualify him from serving in public office in the future. Precedent suggests that the Senate would likely need to hold two separate votes on removal and disqualification, although the disqualification vote may require only a simple majority to be approved, as opposed to the two-thirds vote necessary for removal from office.

The rebellion could affect future corporate donations. In a new ad, the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump Republican group, accused Mr. Cruz and Mr. Hawley — as well as Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have promoted the president's election fraud contentions but haven't committed to the certification challenge — of attempting to suppress millions of votes, and called out the corporate America titans who are funding them, naming AT&T, Charles Schwab and Citigroup. If that creates reputational issues, companies may think twice about donations to challengers in 2022 — and beyond.

The next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran's malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it's carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.
The British government was livid about the lack of notice, according to current and former officials, particularly because there are about 400 British troops deployed in Iraq, and Britain has historically been more closely aligned with the United States on combat operations there than any other country.
After that, 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy.

The result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride.
The findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among Covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. Based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 I.C.U. patients treated early with these drugs. All of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.
A Chevron PAC donated $10,000 to Mr. Daines. The company acknowledged in a written statement that it engages with many people and organizations that take positions that are not always aligned with all their views, and said it looks forward to engaging with President-elect Biden and his team.
Any remaining notions that the presidential transition would go smoothly were shattered this weekend when 11 Republican senators announced that they would not certify Joe Biden's Electoral College victory during a joint Congressional session on Wednesday. At the same time, President Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to find enough votes to flip the state to him, on a Saturday phone call that was recorded. (That said, the prospect of a constitutional crisis hasn't rattled markets: U.S. futures are up this morning.)
You follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice, Ms. Doggart posted on the Facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.'Oh no. Wait. We were mistaken. It's actually the opposite thing you should be doing!'
Michael Smart, a managing director and trade expert at Rock Creek Global Advisors, said a large part of the Biden administration's affirmative agenda in response to China, which includes efforts to make the American economy more competitive, would fall within the Commerce Department's jurisdiction.
The closing of I.E.S. facilities was carried out haphazardly, straining the system for months. As many as 620 children needed to be rehoused; most landed in Southwest Key facilities.
But Britain is involved in a high-stakes race to roll out its mass vaccination program before its overstretched health service is overwhelmed by the new variant. Already, non-Covid treatment is being postponed, again, and images of ambulances stacking up in the parking lots of some hospitals last week illustrated the challenge faced by the country's weary health workers.
One such action kept in place Obama-era standards on smog-causing emissions that, even when originally issued, fell short of the standard recommended by public health experts. Another imposed the federal government's first regulation to control planet-warming pollution from airplanes but did not require airlines to go beyond emissions limits that they had set for themselves. And a third updates regulations around lead pipes in a way that environmental critics said falls far short of an overhaul needed to ensure safe drinking water.
Jan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET 'I thought we'd have to fight our way out,' a congressman says. The House gallery was evacuated during the invasion. Credit... Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Within minutes of the mob breaching the Capitol complex, rioters were pounding on the doors of the House gallery, where a group of lawmakers were trapped. I thought we'd have to fight our way out, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq. Mr. Crow said he moved other members away from the barricaded door inside the gallery, helped them don gas masks, told them to take off the lapel pins assigned to all House members and took out his only possible weapon — a pen. After 15 minutes, he said, Capitol Police and SWAT team members on a rescue mission hustled the members out by clearing a path outside the gallery, above the House floor. With police in the lead, guns drawn, the lawmakers entered a scene of chaos and mayhem, Mr. Crow said. Some police rushed to barricade doors to block rioters. Others pinned protesters to the ground to allow the lawmakers to pass. We heard yelling through the halls, said Mr. Crow, who described bringing up the rear to ensure all the members made it to safety.
Officials said on Friday that the acting defense secretary, Christopher C. Miller, had ordered the redeployment of the ship in part as a de-escalatory signal to Tehran to avoid stumbling into a crisis in President Trump's waning days in office. American intelligence reports indicate that Iran and its proxies may be preparing a strike as early as this weekend to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
But far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (No blood for oil is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.
The remarks also reflected the disarray that has surrounded the president's decision, which took his staff and foreign allies by surprise and drew objections from the Pentagon that it was logistically impossible and strategically unwise. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned within hours of the announcement, and the Pentagon chief of staff, Kevin M. Sweeney, said on Saturday evening that he was also leaving.
But when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.
The mortgage finance company will also impose restrictions on future sales of foreclosed homes to firms that engage in abusive forms of seller financing — which includes selling homes on either rent-to-own leases or in long-term installment agreements known as contract for deed.

So let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.

Remote workers have staked out coffee shops for years, but small-business owners say their ranks are rising. In 2016, 43 percent of American employees spent some time working remotely, according to a Gallup survey; the number who telecommute at least half the time has grown by 115 percent since 2005, said a report last year from FlexJobs and Global Workplace Analytics. Add in the self-employed, and the crowd gets even bigger. And while some still embrace the home-and-pajama model, a large contingent hits the corner cafe.

As police led the members down stairwells and into the subterranean maze of tunnels to a secure location, Mr. Crow said he called his wife, who had been watching the terrifying scene on television from Colorado. Mr. Crow said lawmakers were determined to resume their work in the Capitol on Wednesday night, if possible, once the buildings were cleared of remaining threats. We want to go back and finish the business of the people to show that we are a democracy, and that the government is stronger than any mob, he said. Read more
There are six areas of health policy where congressional aides and health policy experts could see Democrats focusing their efforts this year. Smaller policy reforms are expected to be easier, both legally and politically, while more ambitious policies may not easily slot into reconciliation's strict rules — or the political preferences of enough Democratic lawmakers.
But no: Washington was obsessed with debt. The Simpson-Bowles report was the talk of the town. Paul Ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. And between the capital's debt obsession, the Republican takeover of the House, and a hard right turn in state governments, America was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.
One possible outcome is that a spooked Iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. Suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the Islamic Republic's thinking, says the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad. For 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. It may now take its time to reassess that view.
Jan. 6, 2021, 8:09 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 8:09 p.m. ET A prominent business group calls on Pence to start Constitutional process to remove Trump from office. Vice President Mike Pence taking part in a joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 election results on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump. The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office. This is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
Instead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with Aziz Ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. The woman, who used the alias Grace, recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at Mr. Ansari's downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and Uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, Babe. We are meant to infer that the comedian's self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there's no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of Syrah.
Coca-Cola said in a statement that it had also been changing the way it funded scientific research through greater transparency and by ending its practice of providing the lion's share of money for studies. In recent years, it added, Coca-Cola has sought to address mounting obesity in China by offering an array of new sugar-free beverages and through improved nutrition labeling on products. We recognize that too much sugar isn't good for anyone, it said.
That's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. A year later, Assad's army launched a chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] In response, the U.S. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. But a new threat was also emerging — ISIS. In 2014, the U.S. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. These efforts expanded and the U.S. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. In 2016, U.S.-supported fighters took control of the ISIS stronghold of Manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, Raqqa. There are now around 2,000 American forces in Syria who are largely fighting alongside the Kurdish groups. This has been a problem for America's ally Turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the Kurds. U.S. troops have had run-ins with Assad's forces as well as groups backed by Russia and Iran. Since taking office, Trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by Assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. We are prepared to sustain this response, until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. U.S. officials and allies dispute the claim that ISIS has been defeated. They warn that an American departure will weaken U.S. influence in the region and may embolden Russia, Iran and Turkey, who are also on the ground. The other worry?
Pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.
Senior Pentagon officials said that Mr. Miller assessed that dispatching the Nimitz now, before the first anniversary this Sunday of General Suleimani's death in an American drone strike in Iraq, could remove what Iranian hard-liners see as a provocation that justifies their threats against American military targets. Some analysts said the return of the Nimitz to its home port of Bremerton, Wash., was a welcome reduction in tensions between the two countries.
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has abruptly sent the aircraft carrier Nimitz home from the Middle East and Africa over the objections of top military advisers, marking a reversal of a weekslong muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring Iran from attacking American troops and diplomats in the Persian Gulf.
The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.
Realizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. Their goal: a California law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates. After an earlier lobbying push, legislators have already voted to protect the companies from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires, and utilities are seeking the same for 2018.
They could include a measure finalized this week to restrict the type of scientific studies the Environmental Protection Agency can use to develop new air and water protections, and another granting liability protection to companies that accidentally kill migratory birds.

He also noted that none of the people arrested were residents of the District of Columbia. At the same news conference, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the violent protests, where Trump supporters looted and vandalized congressional offices, shameful and unpatriotic. And she pledged that anyone who has engaged in these activities will be held accountable. There will be law and order and this behavior will not be tolerated, she said. Read more
It is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by California's investor-owned utilities. The largest, Pacific Gas and Electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. The most devastating of those, the Camp Fire, destroyed thousands of homes in Paradise and killed at least 86 people.
We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war, Mr. Trump said. The president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. But his policy toward Iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.
People are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.
It's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.
The fabric feels cheap, though. I hate the fabric. I hate the fit. They squeeze my thighs when I pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. They are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. And yet, beginning in September, I have been wearing them at least three times a week.
It was a circumspect reaction for a politician not known for his circumspection, and it underscored Mr. Johnson's predicament as he confronts what is arguably the first foreign policy crisis of the post-Brexit era.

Even before polls closed on Tuesday, senior Republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of Mr. Trump's denial.
Ms. Loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line Trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. In recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with Mr. Trump in northwest Georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to Mr. Biden when Congress meets on Wednesday.
Battered by a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, local jails and state prison systems around the United States have resorted to a drastic strategy to keep the virus at bay: Shutting down completely and transferring their inmates elsewhere.
The results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced Covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (Most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
The 60-second ad, to be released Monday, is the third in a campaign introduced in 2015 by the National Limousine Association to promote Ride Responsibly, an initiative that encourages riders to think before you app.
How fitting is it that President Trump's first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?
America's killing of Iran's top security and intelligence commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, this morning has sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Tehran. And markets are taking notice.
But a couple of Republicans joined Democrats in raising grave questions about Mr. Trump's strategy, concerns that only sharpened after the briefings on Capitol Hill by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel.
While Mr. Bolton said on Sunday that he expected American forces to eventually leave northeastern Syria, where most of the 2,000 troops in the country are based for the mission against the Islamic State, he began to lay out an argument for keeping some troops at a garrison in the southeast that is used to monitor the flow of Iranian arms and soldiers. In September, three months before Mr. Trump's announcement, Mr. Bolton had declared that the United States would remain in Syria as long as Iranians were on the ground there.
Ms. Mitchell's resignation was the latest evidence of the problems Mr. Trump has created for law firms throughout his time in office, as their employees and clients object to ties with the president.
A bipartisan, if mildly conservative, group of senators has indicated that it will introduce legislation intended to increase the rule-making requirements on Wall Street regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Board.
The Trump administration has also rushed in recent weeks to lock in weak pollution rules.
According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.
The rebellion could affect future corporate donations. In a new ad, the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump Republican group, accused Mr. Cruz and Mr. Hawley — as well as Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have promoted the president's election fraud contentions but haven't committed to the certification challenge — of attempting to suppress millions of votes, and called out the corporate America titans who are funding them, naming AT&T, Charles Schwab and Citigroup. If that creates reputational issues, companies may think twice about donations to challengers in 2022 — and beyond.
If the Nimitz is departing, that could be because the Pentagon believes that the threat could subside somewhat, said Michael P. Mulroy, the Pentagon's former top Middle East policy official.
If the internet companies want to give everyone a voice and create healthier online spaces, perhaps Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should subject the prominent band of habitual online misleaders to stricter rules. This could dial back some of the internet's dangers by penalizing those who do the most harm without stifling a vast majority's free expression.
Mr. Daines and Mr. Marshall received $10,000 each from a Goldman Sachs PAC. The bank has warned that sowing doubt about the orderly transfer of power threatens the economy. It did not respond to a request for comment.
All 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in a joint op-ed that the time for questioning the results has passed.
That set of differences amounts to one of Asia's biggest potential flash points. Since Ms. Tsai came to power in 2016, China has ramped up pressure on her government. It has increased patrols by military aircraft, sent bombers to circle the island and sailed an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.
The day after Iranian missile struck bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, Republicans and Democrats in Congress split sharply over the president's approach on Iran and the way forward. Amid back-to-back classified briefings by top administration officials for members of the House and Senate, most Republicans praised Mr. Trump effusively on Wednesday for targeting General Suleimani and for his restraint in responding to Iran's action.
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican, circulated a 21-page memo to House colleagues explaining why the move sets an exceptionally dangerous precedent.
The senators have suggested that they would impose cost-benefit analysis requirements on America's financial regulators. No important rule could be passed without establishing that the dollar impositions on the financial industry would not be outweighed by the dollar benefits created by the rule.
Professor Greenhalgh's findings were based on interviews with Chinese officials and scientists, and a review of public documents produced by Coca-Cola and ILSI.
Some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. And we were mostly right. Why only mostly? Because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. The obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.
The targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone at Baghdad International Airport was an impressive display of American military prowess. And it liquidated a destabilizing figure: The general was the commander of the Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. In the scheme of things, he had it coming. Yet killing him made little strategic sense for the United States. In some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of American foreign policymaking.

He said that Mr. Trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history, he said of Mr. Trump's supporters. That will be their legacy. Former President George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the Capitol. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name. It is a sickening and heartbreaking sight, Mr. Bush said. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement. Read more

The Chinese government, Ms. Tsai said, must handle our differences peacefully and as equals.
That's the message I take from Olivier Blanchard's presidential address to the American Economic Association. To be fair, Blanchard — one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the I.M.F. — was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all MMT and say that debt never matters. But his analysis nonetheless makes the Fix the Debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.
Mr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
The findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among Covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. Based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 I.C.U. patients treated early with these drugs. All of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.
Like other Chinese provincial leaders, Mr. Luo has had some dealings with Hong Kong, especially over investment and business. He held talks with his predecessor, Mr. Wang, at least once, leading a delegation from Shanxi Province to Hong Kong in late 2018. On that visit, Mr. Luo also met the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, to discuss investment opportunities. But he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in Hong Kong.
A lawyer advising President Trump in recent weeks has resigned from her law firm after it was revealed that she participated in the call where Mr. Trump pressured Georgia officials to help him reverse the state's election results, the firm said in a statement on Tuesday.
Chris Hughes was raised by Lutheran parents in Hickory, N.C., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. Every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and Mr. Hughes carried that tradition into adulthood. But in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his Facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.
He wanted a courtyard where people talked to one another, not a silent office for remote workers. And while anyone with a cellphone hot spot could connect without his help, he had made himself clear. On a recent weekday morning, almost a year and a half later, the courtyard was still full of people, but this time they were talking to one another. Only one was at his laptop.
The department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
Trump's problem is that, until Thursday, that's what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.
As Senator Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has put it, the long-term growth of living standards depends on periodically lightening the regulatory load – the equivalent of scraping barnacles off the bottom.
In just a few decades, China has gone from a nation plagued by food shortages to one buffeted by soaring obesity and chronic diseases tied to poor diet. More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. In Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the president had shown patience and prudence.
Just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.

Now the rest of the world understands that Trump could actually make a comeback in 2024, so that is a shadow that he will cast over American politics, Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Graham, who described the dangers of making the announcement first and then considering the longer-term implications, added, The president is slowing down and is re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives: Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back.

In his new book, Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn, out this week, Mr. Hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and Facebook's success — technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms — have created a winner takes all economy in which only a small group of people succeed.
Ayaan, 24, who had been at the institution for two years, said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued.
The remarks also reflected the disarray that has surrounded the president's decision, which took his staff and foreign allies by surprise and drew objections from the Pentagon that it was logistically impossible and strategically unwise. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned within hours of the announcement, and the Pentagon chief of staff, Kevin M. Sweeney, said on Saturday evening that he was also leaving.
The Biden team, meantime, said this week that it had underestimated the damage that the Trump administration had done to climate and environment policy and was keeping all options on the table to bolster federal agencies and the work they do.
We would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.
Tensions, and oil prices, rise after U.S. move against Iran
The alternative? Iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like Hezbollah for political deniability. It could try to take hostages at the American Embassy in Baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could use its influence in Iraq to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what Suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies observes. And it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing Trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.

Supporters of President Donald Trump climb up the side of the Capitol to enter in protest. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Wednesday night issued an order extending the city's public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support President Trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation's capital. The order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety. The directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20. It came hours after Ms. Bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday. In a statement explaining the extension, Ms. Bowser pointed to the pro-Trump protesters who came to the city for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns, Ms. Bowser wrote. They have breached the security of the Capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the Capitol.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, is now the richest person in the world. An increase in Tesla's share price on Thursday pushed Mr. Musk past Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people. Mr. Musk's net worth was $195 billion by the end of trading on Thursday, $10 billion more than that of Mr. Bezos's. Mr. Musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion over the past 12 months, thanks to a rally in Tesla's share price, which surged 743 percent in 2020. The carmaker's shares rose nearly 8 percent on Thursday.
That set of differences amounts to one of Asia's biggest potential flash points. Since Ms. Tsai came to power in 2016, China has ramped up pressure on her government.

Lindsay P. Cohn, a professor of political science at the Naval War College, said that Mr. Trump appears to be convinced that General Suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the Middle East. It satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.
All 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in a joint op-ed that the time for questioning the results has passed.
The Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford goes into use. Britain began inoculations with the shot, which has also received emergency approval in India. Scientists are increasingly immersed in debates about vaccination policy, including whether to delay booster doses to give more first shots faster.
Mr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. The social network's colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes's career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.
But Britain is involved in a high-stakes race to roll out its mass vaccination program before its overstretched health service is overwhelmed by the new variant. Already, non-Covid treatment is being postponed, again, and images of ambulances stacking up in the parking lots of some hospitals last week illustrated the challenge faced by the country's weary health workers.
Professor Greenhalgh's findings were based on interviews with Chinese officials and scientists, and a review of public documents produced by Coca-Cola and ILSI.
Mr. Trump's refusal to acknowledge his defeat also robbed Ms. Loeffler of what might have been her best argument in what is still a slightly right-leaning state — that she would be a check on the liberal excesses in a government fully controlled by Democrats.
To do this, the cabinet and Congress must deploy the 25th Amendment and impeachment in sequence.
A progressive Democrat could wield the powers of the Commerce Department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.
By the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.
Ministers had been celebrating the deployment of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not only cheaper than the one from Pfizer-BioNTech but also much easier to store. They said it could help turn the tide in Britain's battle against the virus.

By Reuters By Reuters By Reuters slide 1 slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 There are still protesters — and even more law enforcement — around the Capitol in Washington tonight, several hours after a curfew was imposed following a pro-Trump mob's storming of the building.
The Pentagon has claimed, facilely, that General Suleimani was hit because the Revolutionary Guard was planning attacks on American targets in the region. But in a proper interagency review, the intelligence community could have pointed out that decapitation is a patently unreliable means of pre-emption — particularly when the organization in question is the Revolutionary Guard, an integral part of a well-honed security state with considerable depth of command talent.
Patrick Chevallereau, a former French military officer now at RUSI, a defense research institution in London, said that the Trump call shows that the current president is in a mind-set to do anything — absolutely anything — before Jan. 20. There is zero standard, zero reference, zero ethics. He added: Everything else than himself can be destroyed and collapse, including us.

While Mr. Warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first Democrat to be elected to the Senate from Georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved Ossoff-Perdue race and its implications for the next two years in American politics. Whichever party wins that race will control the Senate, with Republicans counting on Mr. Perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain Mr. Biden's policy ambitions.
It would not be difficult for many people to revile a landlord lawyer, yet over dinner at the Palm Too, a Midtown East steakhouse near his apartment, this lawyer with a penchant for racecars came across as unexpectedly likable as he told stories in sometimes off-color language about risks he has taken, like racing at 140 miles per hour on the interstate but talking himself out of a traffic ticket.

Historically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. But given the growing importance of the U.S. competition with China, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.

If the Nimitz is departing, that could be because the Pentagon believes that the threat could subside somewhat, said Michael P. Mulroy, the Pentagon's former top Middle East policy official.
Thomas Wright, an Irish-born expert on America at the Brookings Institution, said that People are worried for real that Trump will come back. The months since the election have shown people just how bad a second term would have been — the guardrails off, a completely personalized government and giving voice to his authoritarian tendencies, he said.
World leaders all know that Trump is sort of crazy, but it's the extremity of his actions, the lengths to which he has gone, that he got 74 million votes and is not retiring but will be a force for the Republicans that is disconcerting, he added. People knew what Trump is like, but the importance is the shadow of the future.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images President Trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard to quell violent protests at the Capitol, according to a person with knowledge of the events. In the end, it was Vice President Mike Pence, defense and administration officials said, who approved the order to deploy. It was unclear why Mr. Trump, who is still technically the commander in chief, did not give the order. The mobilization was initiated with the help of Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials, according to the person with knowledge of the events. Kash Patel, the chief of staff to Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary, responded: The acting secretary and the president have spoken multiple times this week about the request for National Guard personnel in D.C. During these conversations, the president conveyed to the acting secretary that he should take any necessary steps to support civilian law enforcement requests in securing the Capitol and federal buildings. The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard, an Army official said Wednesday, and Virginia's governor dispatched members of the Virginia Guard along with 200 Virginia State Troopers to quell the violence in the nation's capital.

However, reconciliation bills must follow a set of complicated requirements known as the Byrd Rule. The simplest way of thinking about them is that legislative provisions have to be budgetary to be allowed. That means that the process isn't ideal for writing large-scale health reform, experts say, but it may be the best tool Democrats have to pass laws with their slim majority.

Iranian forces or their proxies were days from attacking American personnel when President Trump decided to strike General Suleimani, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters at the Pentagon. Mr. Esper added that General Suleimani had traveled to Baghdad to coordinate attacks following up on a two-day siege of the United States Embassy there last week by pro-Iranian demonstrators. He declined to elaborate but called the intelligence exquisite.

Congress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the Affordable Care Act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. One priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, condemned President Trump on Wednesday night for the breaching of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, saying that the president bore direct responsibility for the violence that disrupted the counting of electoral votes by Congress. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States, Mr. Romney said in a statement. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. Mr. Romney, the lone Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Mr. Trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by Mr. Trump's supporters in recent days. Videos showed one of the president's followers confronting Mr. Romney before a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport earlier this week. He was later heckled by Mr. Trump's supporters aboard a flight. In his statement, Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was because of a selfish man's injured pride.
In late 2010 and early 2011, the U.S. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. You might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.

The notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. They were designed to United States Customs and Border Protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. Aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture.

Boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a legal settlement with the Justice Department stemming from the 737 Max debacle, the government said on Thursday. The agreement resolves a criminal charge that Boeing conspired to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the company and evaluates its planes. With less than two weeks left in the Trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a Biden Justice Department would view a settlement off the table. President Trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of Boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company.

Instead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with Aziz Ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. The woman, who used the alias Grace, recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at Mr. Ansari's downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and Uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, Babe. We are meant to infer that the comedian's self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there's no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of Syrah.

In addition to denouncing deindustrialization and promoting business in Rhode Island, she does have firsthand experience with China's economic challenges: Her father was laid off when the watch factory where he worked in Providence, R.I., moved to China.
How Mr. Trump sees the killing of General Suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on Iran is unclear, and on Friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the United States and Iran do not spiral out of control. General Suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.
In 1993, Ms. Chen became the head of ILSA-China and she remained a senior adviser to the organization until her death last year. Professors Greenhalgh and Popkin said that Ms. Chen was instrumental in stymying attempts to address soaring obesity by stressing the harmful impact of consuming highly processed food and sugary soft drinks.
But a couple of Republicans joined Democrats in raising grave questions about Mr. Trump's strategy, concerns that only sharpened after the briefings on Capitol Hill by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel.
Second, the House should quickly draw up and pass articles of impeachment. And then the Senate should hold a fair — but immediate and efficient — trial both to remove President Trump from office and, as important, to disqualify him from serving in public office in the future. Precedent suggests that the Senate would likely need to hold two separate votes on removal and disqualification, although the disqualification vote may require only a simple majority to be approved, as opposed to the two-thirds vote necessary for removal from office.
One of the biggest firms in the rent-to-own home business is now on the federal government's do-not-sell list.
It would not be difficult for many people to revile a landlord lawyer, yet over dinner at the Palm Too, a Midtown East steakhouse near his apartment, this lawyer with a penchant for racecars came across as unexpectedly likable as he told stories in sometimes off-color language about risks he has taken, like racing at 140 miles per hour on the interstate but talking himself out of a traffic ticket.
The Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the United States military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
An Exxon Mobil PAC contributed $10,000 to Ms. Lummis. In a statement to DealBook, the company said we congratulate President-elect Biden on his election.

I don't really remember when I pulled the black Everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. Was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? Or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? Or the fall, when I began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while I was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?
The arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower Mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, Sellian, and Priya Rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. Grace Nakamura, an adjudicator for the Immigration and Refugee Board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, Kumi. The latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a Greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. It's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: Bala vilifies the Canadian Border Services Agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, Stephen Harper, and sings the praises of the Canadian Tamil Congress, which appears here as the Tamil Alliance.

The challenge isn't expected to delay the inauguration on Jan. 20, but it turns a routine process into a political showdown. Those who spoke up against the move did so in stark terms:
Also troubling to many is the letter that the last 10 living secretaries of defense all signed urging the nation — and the military — to accept that the election is over and the time for questioning the results has passed.

Pool photo by Erin Schaff Lawmakers will resume counting Electoral College votes on Wednesday after a mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said, as she vowed that the attack could not deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden. Ms. Pelosi, in a letter to colleagues, said she had reached that decision after consulting with her leadership team and a series of calls with the Pentagon, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence. She made no mention of the president. 'We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night, Ms. Pelosi wrote. We also knew that we would be a part of history in a positive way, today, despite ill-founded objections to the Electoral College vote. We now will be part of history, as such a shameful picture of our country was put out to the world, instigated at the highest level. Read more

Experts say the fallout is easy to predict: The jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease-ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls.
The new balance of power would also make it easier for Mr. Biden's cabinet appointees to win confirmation, as well as for Democrats to increase the budgets of federal agencies and pump money into clean energy research and development. It also would greatly increase the likelihood that Congress would incorporate portions of Mr. Biden's $2 trillion climate plan into new economic stimulus legislation as well as an infrastructure package.
Mr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
Passage of much major legislation, however, requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, so Democrats would still be forced to compromise with Republicans and would be limited in their ability to pass sweeping new laws, said Robert Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
World leaders all know that Trump is sort of crazy, but it's the extremity of his actions, the lengths to which he has gone, that he got 74 million votes and is not retiring but will be a force for the Republicans that is disconcerting, he added. People knew what Trump is like, but the importance is the shadow of the future.
Lindsay P. Cohn, a professor of political science at the Naval War College, said that Mr. Trump appears to be convinced that General Suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the Middle East. It satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.
The government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.
It is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by California's investor-owned utilities. The largest, Pacific Gas and Electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. The most devastating of those, the Camp Fire, destroyed thousands of homes in Paradise and killed at least 86 people.
The results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced Covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (Most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)

She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.
Boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a legal settlement with the Justice Department stemming from the 737 Max debacle, the government said on Thursday. The agreement resolves a criminal charge that Boeing conspired to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the company and evaluates its planes. With less than two weeks left in the Trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a Biden Justice Department would view a settlement off the table. President Trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of Boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company.
How fitting is it that President Trump's first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?
First, Vice President Pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment in order to make a declaration that Mr. Trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This would immediately suspend, but not remove, Mr. Trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint Mr. Pence as acting president. The 25th Amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, condemned President Trump on Wednesday night for the breaching of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, saying that the president bore direct responsibility for the violence that disrupted the counting of electoral votes by Congress. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States, Mr. Romney said in a statement. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. Mr. Romney, the lone Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Mr. Trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by Mr. Trump's supporters in recent days. Videos showed one of the president's followers confronting Mr. Romney before a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport earlier this week. He was later heckled by Mr. Trump's supporters aboard a flight. In his statement, Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was because of a selfish man's injured pride.

People are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.
How businesses are being linked with this gambit. The senators rejecting the election count include Steve Daines of Montana, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Roger Marshall of Kansas, who ran and won their seats in 2020.

The legislation would require more math and permit less flexibility by those regulators. But it would also limit Congress's own ability to require the government to embrace good governance values like transparency and honesty, if the S.E.C.'s most recent rule-making is any guide.
But others reacted with sadness, wondering whether better information earlier on might have prevented their children's allergies.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Rattled but defiant, members of Congress returned to the Capitol on Wednesday night to resume counting the electoral votes from the November election, a process that leaders on both sides of the aisle said would not be derailed by the earlier siege of the building by President Trump's supporters. This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said as the Senate reconvened. Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the majority leader after Democrats won both of Tuesday's runoffs in Georgia, said that January 6, 2021, was a date that would live in infamy, invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt's phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. He called Mr. Trump's supporters who stormed the building goons and thugs. Moments earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the rioters unhinged and referred to the siege as a failed insurrection. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation, he said. From the dais of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol during the breach, thanked law enforcement officers for restoring order and protecting leaders.

The alternative? Iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like Hezbollah for political deniability. It could try to take hostages at the American Embassy in Baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could use its influence in Iraq to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what Suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies observes. And it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing Trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.
Disqualification is necessary given Mr. Trump's anti-democratic response to the 2020 election and the continuing danger that he will pose to constitutional norms if allowed to flirt with a return to power in 2024. Indeed, the importance of disqualification in this case is such that the Congress should proceed with impeachment even if Mr. Trump's term in office has already concluded.

Legislators have often turned to reconciliation to pass health policy when their majority is slim. Democrats used it in 2010 to pass final tweaks to the Affordable Care Act after losing their supermajority. Republicans used it in a failed effort to repeal the health law in 2017 and in a successful attempt later the same year to make changes to the tax code.

In late 2010 and early 2011, the U.S. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. You might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.

It is a sickening and heartbreaking sight, Mr. Bush said. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic.

Mr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast.
The next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran's malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it's carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.
Speaking a day before China's leader, Xi Jinping, was expected to make a major speech about Taiwan, Ms. Tsai said that China must respect the freedom and democracy of Taiwan's 23 million people. Her remarks came amid a shift in the island's political landscape, with Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party having suffered major losses in local elections in November. Candidates who favor closer ties with China won mayoral contests in Taiwan's four largest cities.
Trump's problem is that, until Thursday, that's what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.
Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
The day after Iranian missile struck bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, Republicans and Democrats in Congress split sharply over the president's approach on Iran and the way forward. Amid back-to-back classified briefings by top administration officials for members of the House and Senate, most Republicans praised Mr. Trump effusively on Wednesday for targeting General Suleimani and for his restraint in responding to Iran's action.
The result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride.
The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.
When you accept a ride from a ride-hail app, you also accept the risks that come with it, Ms. Anderson says in a voice-over. Many ride-hail companies consider their drivers third-party providers, so they don't have to accept any responsibility or accountability for their actions. Always ride responsibly.
The Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty.
People in England were being encouraged to obey the new rules immediately, though some of the new restrictions will not be given legal force until Wednesday morning and there is likely to be a vote in Parliament, which is being recalled specially on the same day.

From California to Missouri to Pennsylvania, state and local officials say that so many guards have fallen ill with the virus and are unable to work that abruptly closing some correctional facilities is the only way to maintain community security and prisoner safety.
It is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which happen to be its competitors. In November, for instance, two women sued Uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in Florida and California. And last month an Uber driver in Beirut, Lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of Rebecca Dykes, a British diplomat.
Iranian forces or their proxies were days from attacking American personnel when President Trump decided to strike General Suleimani, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters at the Pentagon. Mr. Esper added that General Suleimani had traveled to Baghdad to coordinate attacks following up on a two-day siege of the United States Embassy there last week by pro-Iranian demonstrators. He declined to elaborate but called the intelligence exquisite.
A Southwest Key spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the Office of Refugee Resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from Texas, Arizona or California. He said the charity was focused on providing the best care possible for children.
Mr. Daines and Mr. Marshall received $10,000 each from a Goldman Sachs PAC. The bank has warned that sowing doubt about the orderly transfer of power threatens the economy. It did not respond to a request for comment.
Historically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. But given the growing importance of the U.S. competition with China, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.
The Chinese government, Ms. Tsai said, must handle our differences peacefully and as equals.
Speaking a day before China's leader, Xi Jinping, was expected to make a major speech about Taiwan, Ms. Tsai said that China must respect the freedom and democracy of Taiwan's 23 million people. Her remarks came amid a shift in the island's political landscape, with Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party having suffered major losses in local elections in November. Candidates who favor closer ties with China won mayoral contests in Taiwan's four largest cities.

The increases closely follow growing prosperity in China that began in the 1980s as Beijing embraced market economics after decades of isolation. In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first companies allowed into the country, and ILSI arrived soon afterward. Seeking to identify influential scientists it could work with, the group found a partner in Chen Chunming, a leading nutritionist who was the founding president of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the forerunner of China's C.D.C.

BERLIN — Seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, Sebastian Kurz, Austria's former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on Thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive Greens.
So let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.
Ayaan, 24, who had been at the institution for two years, said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued.
The logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters, Ms. Cancian said. The best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel.
The voters have spoken, said Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah, in a statement also signed by some Democratic colleagues. Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.
Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.

Cleta Mitchell has informed firm management of her decision to resign from Foley & Lardner effective immediately, the firm said in its statement. Ms. Mitchell concluded that her departure was in the firm's best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests. We thank her for her contributions to the firm and wish her well.
The targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone at Baghdad International Airport was an impressive display of American military prowess. And it liquidated a destabilizing figure: The general was the commander of the Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. In the scheme of things, he had it coming. Yet killing him made little strategic sense for the United States. In some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of American foreign policymaking.
The legislation would require more math and permit less flexibility by those regulators. But it would also limit Congress's own ability to require the government to embrace good governance values like transparency and honesty, if the S.E.C.'s most recent rule-making is any guide.
If the internet companies want to give everyone a voice and create healthier online spaces, perhaps Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should subject the prominent band of habitual online misleaders to stricter rules. This could dial back some of the internet's dangers by penalizing those who do the most harm without stifling a vast majority's free expression.
A public vote and rapid trial in the Senate would give much-needed legitimacy to actions to remove Mr. Trump from office. By forcing Republicans to stand up for democracy and against the president's actions, it would also reaffirm bipartisan support for the fundamental principles of American democracy. Further, while the 25th Amendment is intended mainly for illness or other objective incapacities, impeachment offers an appropriate moral response to the president's conduct, including incitement to violence and attacks on basic democratic norms.
However, reconciliation bills must follow a set of complicated requirements known as the Byrd Rule. The simplest way of thinking about them is that legislative provisions have to be budgetary to be allowed. That means that the process isn't ideal for writing large-scale health reform, experts say, but it may be the best tool Democrats have to pass laws with their slim majority.
I don't really remember when I pulled the black Everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. Was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? Or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? Or the fall, when I began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while I was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?
William Reinsch, the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Biden and his team had placed a lot of emphasis on competing more effectively with China, including efforts to augment American industry that could be run through the Commerce Department.

Mr. Graham, who described the dangers of making the announcement first and then considering the longer-term implications, added, The president is slowing down and is re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives: Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back.
LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the Caribbean island of Mustique, still basking in the glow of his recent election victory, when the news came last Friday that President Trump had ordered the killing of a powerful Iranian general — without tipping off, let alone consulting, his British ally.

But far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (No blood for oil is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.
Why do this with only about two weeks left in President Trump's term? Because we must defend our democracy for all Americans, now. And we must preserve our democracy for future Americans. We must ensure a field of potential Republican presidential hopefuls in 2024 who have integrity. And we must reassure the world, and especially would-be authoritarian regimes, about what United States policy will be on questions of freedom and self-rule now and in the future.
I was left to fend for myself, she told The Times of London. The loan has caused so much anxiety.
Patrick Chevallereau, a former French military officer now at RUSI, a defense research institution in London, said that the Trump call shows that the current president is in a mind-set to do anything — absolutely anything — before Jan. 20. There is zero standard, zero reference, zero ethics. He added: Everything else than himself can be destroyed and collapse, including us.
Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Twitter, taking a harder line, locks President Trump's account. Facebook does the same. President Donald Trump's taped message from the White House was removed by Twitter. Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump's account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington. Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump's tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. Facebook later said it had assessed two policy violations against Mr. Trump's page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. Twitter said it was acting as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C. This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets, the company said on Twitter. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked. The tweets that were removed repeated Mr. Trump's false claims of election fraud and expressed praise and sympathy for those who had forced their way into the Capitol and disrupted Congress's certification of the election results.
Some progressive groups have protested Ms. Raimondo's selection, arguing that the Biden administration should look to a populist Democrat instead. In a Jan. 6 announcement, the Revolving Door Project and Demand Progress criticized Ms. Raimondo as a corporate insider who locked in liability protection for businesses but stripped funding from low-income areas of Rhode Island during the pandemic.
I must emphasize, the results of the past election absolutely do not represent that the will of the people at the grass-roots level seeks to give up our sovereignty, she said in a New Year's Day address. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory that must be united with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Jan. 6, 2021, 6:15 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:15 p.m. ET Twitter locks Trump's account after he encouraged his supporters to 'remember this day.' President Trump sent a tweet in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen. Credit... Will Oliver/EPA, via Shutterstock In what could be interpreted as an attempt to stoke the flames of a Capitol mob which has begun to disperse, President Trump sent a tweet at around 6 p.m. in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to remember this day going forward. These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, he tweeted. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever! Twitter later took down the tweet, saying that it had violated the company's rules. Mr. Trump also posted a video in which he repeated his baseless claims of widespread election fraud on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. All three social media sites removed the video. Read more
The phrase Jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides American foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in Mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, American foreign policy tends to work.
The policy change by Fannie could put a big crimp in the business model of certain investment firms that have sprouted up since the financial crisis. These firms buy foreclosed homes on the cheap and sell them to people unable to qualify for a conventional mortgage.

She said the industry efforts have been wildly successful, in part because China lacks a free media or watchdog organizations that might have been critical of the relationship.
Several said it was improperly classified, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called it vague and unacceptably unspecific. Lawmakers pressed for more answers on Tuesday at an intelligence briefing by administration officials.
The Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the United States military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
In just a few decades, China has gone from a nation plagued by food shortages to one buffeted by soaring obesity and chronic diseases tied to poor diet. More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. In Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.

While Mr. Bolton said on Sunday that he expected American forces to eventually leave northeastern Syria, where most of the 2,000 troops in the country are based for the mission against the Islamic State, he began to lay out an argument for keeping some troops at a garrison in the southeast that is used to monitor the flow of Iranian arms and soldiers. In September, three months before Mr. Trump's announcement, Mr. Bolton had declared that the United States would remain in Syria as long as Iranians were on the ground there.
A Chevron PAC donated $10,000 to Mr. Daines. The company acknowledged in a written statement that it engages with many people and organizations that take positions that are not always aligned with all their views, and said it looks forward to engaging with President-elect Biden and his team.
As a boy, Bradley Scott Silverbush had a knack for breaking up schoolyard fights in his hometown, Syracuse. His strategy was simple: Collect $1 from the child who was about to be pummeled and split his winnings with the bully to end the dispute.
Now the rest of the world understands that Trump could actually make a comeback in 2024, so that is a shadow that he will cast over American politics, Mr. Wright said.
ILSI does not profess to have been perfect in our 40-year history, the statement said. Not surprisingly, there have been bumps along the way. This is why ILSI has analyzed best practices and has committed to ensuring scientific integrity in nutrition and food sector research.
Any remaining notions that the presidential transition would go smoothly were shattered this weekend when 11 Republican senators announced that they would not certify Joe Biden's Electoral College victory during a joint Congressional session on Wednesday. At the same time, President Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to find enough votes to flip the state to him, on a Saturday phone call that was recorded. (That said, the prospect of a constitutional crisis hasn't rattled markets: U.S. futures are up this morning.)
By contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017.
There are a small number of influential people, including the president, who have repeatedly been instrumental in stoking misinformation about the election or spreading unproven treatments for the coronavirus.
When Mr. Luo stepped down as party chief in Shanxi, in November, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province's political ecology and overhaul its economy, two tasks that Mr. Xi may also want him to take on in Hong Kong. Mr. Luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of Mr. Xi and other central leaders.
It's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Mr. Johnson said in a televised address.
There is hard work ahead to rebuild agencies and our capacities from the ground up and reposition the federal government to be a partner to our workers and communities again — rather than advancing policies that hurt our environment and economy, Gina McCarthy, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to lead a new White House Office of Climate Policy, said in a statement.
