london — prime minister boris johnson was on the caribbean island of mustique, still basking in the glow of his recent election victory, when the news came last friday that president trump had ordered the killing of a powerful iranian general — without tipping off, let alone consulting, his british ally.
it would also provide additional direct city spending, at least $100 million per year when fully implemented, officials said, for the city's hospital system to support care for those without insurance. the city estimates the uninsured population to be about 600,000 people, including as many as 300,000 undocumented residents. a major component of that effort would be improving customer service, including the phone line, to help those with questions about their care.

a virginia state senator, ben chafin, has died from complications of covid-19. an announcement released friday confirmed that ben chafin, a virginia state senator, died after contracting the coronavirus. credit... steve helber/associated press ben chafin, a republican state senator from virginia, has died of complications of covid-19, the state senate's republican caucus confirmed on friday evening. he had been receiving treatment at the vcu medical center in richmond for two weeks, his family said in a statement. mr. chafin, 60, was first elected to virginia's senate in 2014. before his time as senator he served as a member of virginia's house of delegates. he was also the owner and operator of a cattle farm in moccasin valley, in the state's southwest. ben was deeply and wholeheartedly committed to the commonwealth, and especially to the people of southwest virginia, said thomas k. norment jr., the state senate's republican leader. in 2018, mr. chafin was one of four republicans who successfully supported the expansion of medicaid in virginia when his party controlled the senate. doing nothing about the medical conditions, the state of health care in my district, just wasn't the answer any longer, he said on the senate floor. that same year, he sponsored a bill to allow guns in churches in response to a mass shooting at the first baptist church in sutherland springs, texas, in which more than two dozen people were killed. the bill stalled in the house.
some americans may see iran's nuclear expansion as an opportunity to take military action against the iranian regime. when he was a member of congress, secretary of state mike pompeo argued the united states could destroy the iranian nuclear capacity with under 2,000 sorties and it was not an insurmountable task.

mr. trump is correct that the better course is to extricate ourselves from syria, but his fatal error has been in its implementation. most egregiously, his snap decision during a telephone call with president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey betrayed our kurdish partners who led the fight against the islamic state and risked being exposed to assault by turkey and the syrian regime.
democrats win one senate seat in georgia; second race too close to call with control of the senate at stake, the rev. raphael warnock's victory put democrats one step closer to securing a majority. president trump falsely claimed that the vice president has the power to reject electors when the electoral college vote is certified on wednesday.

washington — as we mark the centenary of the united states' entry into world war i, i recall the words of a participant in the versailles treaty, which ended that conflict. this isn't a treaty of peace, the american diplomat william bullitt declared. i can see at least 11 wars in it. the world once again seems to be preparing for war: a wider conflict in syria, greater friction with russia and possible military action on the korean peninsula.

as president, roosevelt was aware that the governments of germany, france and britain had set up programs to help their citizens stave off the financial catastrophes associated with old age, illness, injury, unemployment and loss of a breadwinner. he was embarrassed that the united states had nothing comparable. the idea of using the government's strength to assist those unable to fend for themselves seemed to him a mark of national greatness. and there were few things he coveted more than europe's recognition of american greatness.
in a senior staff meeting on thursday, dr. hahn spoke of the disgust he had watching the events play out, according to one person who heard about his comments. and in a call with her staff on friday, according to someone on the line, ms. verma said she was sickened by the riot after watching out of a window in the department's headquarters off the national mall. separately, in an interview with mcclatchy on friday, dr. redfield warned that the riot could also end up significantly spreading the coronavirus. i do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event, he said. you had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the capitol. dr. redfield, dr. hahn and ms. verma were part of an even larger group of health officials — including dr. deborah l. birx, the white house coronavirus response coordinator, and dr. jerome adams, the surgeon general — upset over mr. trump lashing out at vice president mike pence for failing to disrupt the certification of president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s election victory, according to one of the officials who is familiar with their thinking. mr. pence oversees the white house's coronavirus task force.
this would eliminate a frequent excuse from lawmakers being pressed on their trades: that they weren't involved in day-to-day buying and selling, as senator david perdue of georgia said when he was found to have executed nearly 2,600 trades in one term. and it would shorten the 45-day disclosure delay allowed under the stock act, which prohibits lawmakers from using inside information but allows them to trade in individual stocks.

he also condemned the violence that came shortly after he told his supporters to fight against the election results, falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen from him and said that vice president mike pence could overturn the outcome. this moment calls for healing and reconciliation, mr. trump said, reading from a teleprompter. in his opening, mr. trump claimed that he immediately deployed the national guard to expel the intruders, despite accounts from people familiar with the events saying he had resisted those calls and that it was, in fact, mr. pence who had ordered the national guard to deploy. the demonstrators who infiltrated the capitol have defiled the seat of american democracy, mr. trump said, a day after he had ended a video telling the rioters to go home but ended with, i love you. you do not represent our country, and to those who broke the law, you will pay, he said in the latest video. the video was vital in the sense that mr. trump's ardent supporters will only accept his words, not anyone else's, and officials throughout government are concerned about unrest for the next 13 days around the country. but the president has a long history of recording such videos only to undermine his own remarks a short time later. now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored, he said. we must get on with the business of america. maggie haberman and

but things have not transpired as mr. kim had hoped.
cyberattacks certainly complicate things. a country that might not be able to attack the united states with an aircraft, missile or submarine can use a cyberattack to strike targets on american soil. and as the most common targets are civilian — electrical grids, hospitals, water supplies, transportation infrastructure — cyberwarfare disproportionately threatens citizens, linking american foreign policy with the everyday lives of ordinary americans. it has the power to transform overseas crises into urgent domestic concerns.
we have adhered to our word. president trump campaigned on the promise to recognize the city of jerusalem — the seat of israel's government — as the nation's capital. in may, we moved the u.s. embassy there. these decisions honor a bipartisan congressional resolution from more than two decades ago.

one sure result of the u.s. strike is that the era of u.s.-iraq cooperation is over, richard n. haass, the president of the council on foreign relations and a former american diplomat, wrote on twitter. the u.s. diplomatic & mil presence will end b/c iraq asks us to depart or our presence is just a target or both. the result will be greater iranian influence, terrorism and iraqi infighting.
mr. kim started diplomacy with president trump in 2018, desperate to get the sanctions lifted in return for a partial dismantling of his nuclear facilities. but his three meetings with mr. trump failed to produce a breakthrough.
the account of the december meeting reinforced that message.
the two political parties have historically elected new leaders when they lose control of the white house. but ms. mcdaniel, the niece of senator mitt romney, in effect claimed re-election in the weeks after the election thanks to her broad support with the activist-dominated state chairs and committee members who make up the party's governing board.

the national emergencies act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (this is the authority president trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) intelligence reforms imposed limits on the c.i.a. and f.b.i., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president's power. last but not least, the ethics in government act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of watergate by establishing the office of the independent counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.

smith, a baldheaded black man with a short, graying beard and a nose that looks as if it had been broken more than once, worked as a cook in san quentin prison. he hadn't had a serious disciplinary violation in two decades but was denied parole in each of his eight hearings since becoming eligible in 1996, receiving three-year denials each time. (every parole denial comes with a prescribed length of time — three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years — before the inmate is allowed to try again.) inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier. since then, he had studied the transcript carefully, highlighting the parts that told him what he needed to do to increase his chances of parole. he had to participate in self-help groups that focused especially on three things: gangs, overcoming criminal thinking and the suffering of crime victims. the commissioners, he felt, were trying to help him. i know exactly what she was trying to tell me, he said, referring to the commissioner who presided over his last hearing. she's trying to make sure that i don't go out there and fall into the hands of the same people that i dealt with when i came here, which is understandable.

yes, president trump tried to break our democracy and turn the united states into an authoritarian state controlled by him. he failed — because of the safeguards the founding fathers built into the constitution. the framers were fearful of a rogue tyrant abusing the power of the presidency, as mr. trump did over and over during his four years.

the point was to shift the terms of the polarizing immigration debate and reinforce the argument that those born in the united states or living here legally deserve sympathy as well. but if mr. trump believed the line in his state of the union address would help bring the sides together for the bipartisan agreement he says he seeks, he received little encouragement on wednesday. the two sides appeared further apart than ever.

endearing himself to social conservatives in a way that many did not think possible, mr. trump has cast himself as the most unflinchingly anti-abortion president in at least a generation, breaking with previous republican nominees who generally took a more tepid approach when discussing the issue. president george w. bush insisted that he would apply no litmus test to his supreme court nominees on any issue, including abortion. his father, president george bush, said the same thing, using the same language, reinforcing the mistrust of many social conservatives.

this book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. it is a demand for a new jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-semitism is what has kept judaism alive. this age-old perspective on jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.

right. i mean, these people are battling these immense changes to australia's landscape on a tiny, tiny scale. and they can't save australia's wildlife on their own, but it is mainly volunteers who are battling these blazes and their impacts. and that touches on a deep frustration throughout the country that i've seen in my reporting, that it's falling on people like jason, like susie, to protect australia in this disaster, and that the government of australia isn't doing enough.
had the transparency rule been in effect already, several people said, the e.p.a. could not have made the case to regulate mercury releases from power plants because it could not have shown that the heavy metal impairs brain development. nor could the agency have successfully linked cloudy drinking water to higher rates of gastrointestinal illnesses, and then imposed more rigorous clean water standards.
quadrant information services, an insurance data provider, conducted the analysis for insurancequotes.com. quadrant calculated rates in each state, using data from six major insurance companies. the averages are based on premiums quoted to a hypothetical 45-year-old who owns an 1,800-square-foot, two-story, single-family home built in 1976. the test policy offered $140,000 in dwelling coverage, $300,000 liability coverage and a $500 deductible. the study analyzed three tiers of credit-based insurance scores: excellent, fair and poor.

sui-lee wee and donald mcneil gave us the breaking news that researchers in china have identified a new virus that is behind a mysterious pneumonialike illness that has caused a panic in the central chinese region. 'there's no evidence that the virus, a coronavirus, is readily spread by humans, and it has not been tied to any deaths,' they write. 'but health officials in china and internationally are watching it carefully, as it comes from the same region where the deadly sars epidemic broke out in the early 2000s.'
in other developments across the world: iran 's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, banned on friday the import of any covid-19 vaccines made in the united states or britain, repeating his conspiracy theory that vaccines made by western countries could not be trusted and could harm iranians. iran's red crescent society then announced it would cancel the import of 150,000 donated doses of the pfizer vaccine. the ban caused outrage on social media, with some iranians posting to twitter that mr. khamenei does not have the right to impose his personal views on public health.

the sergeants-at-arms are responsible for security in their respective chambers and related office buildings, while mr. sund oversaw more than 1,800 capitol police personnel. it was unclear immediately who would replace mr. stenger and mr. sund. in his statement, mr. mcconnell said jennifer hemingway, the deputy sergeant-at-arms, would serve as acting sergeant-at-arms. lawmakers in both chambers and from both parties vowed on thursday to find out how those responsible for capitol security had allowed a violent mob to infiltrate the capitol. house democrats announced a robust investigation into the law enforcement breakdown. mr. mcconnell said in a separate statement that a painstaking investigation and thorough review were needed after the events of wednesday, which he described as a massive failure of institutions, protocols, and planning that are supposed to protect the first branch of our federal government. mr. mcconnell added that the ultimate blame for yesterday lies with the unhinged criminals who broke down doors, trampled our nation's flag, fought with law enforcement, and tried to disrupt our democracy, and with those who incited them. but this fact does not and will not preclude our addressing the shocking failures in the capitol's security posture and protocols.
it turned out i'd been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users' credit in certain emergency situations. my bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined $700 million by the consumer financial protection bureau, the government agency that was senator elizabeth warren's brainchild. i tried, maddeningly, to seek redress from the bank — cycling through phone trees, screaming at automated operators. no one could tell me how i'd been enrolled in the program, or for how long.
the focus on filter bubbles causes people to miss the real disaster which is polarization. what happens when you see 26% more content from people you don't agree with? does it help you empathize with them as everyone has been suggesting? nope. it makes you dislike them even more. this is also easy to prove with a thought experiment: whatever your political leaning, think of a publication from the other side that you despise. when you read an article from that outlet, perhaps shared by an uncle or nephew, does it make you rethink your values? or does it make you retreat further into the conviction of your own correctness? if you answered the former, congratulations you are a better person than i am. every time i read something from breitbart i get 10% more liberal.
there was an argument that reforms must proceed in sequence, so they had to be coordinated. but the effect has been that not much has happened since 2013 [when mr. xi became president] in terms of ground-up problem-solving. if you rely on hierarchy and discipline, the courage to experiment at the lower levels is squeezed out. people are afraid of trying things.

there are other ways that the nuclear program makes the government less secure. over the past several years, north korea has degraded its conventional military capacity in order to pursue nuclear weapons. under normal circumstances, a weaker north korean army would be welcome news to the rest of the world, but with a budding nuclear state it can lead to rapid escalation in the event of a conflict. this could mean either pre-emptive action by the united states, or, if north korea ever used nuclear weapons, a massive retaliation.

if the tsuris theory of jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. as the pendulum swings away from the scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the charybdis of assimilation. in this reactive view, jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. the only other alternative--the one proposed by herzl--is for all jews to move to israel, where they control their own destiny. but most jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. in this respect, aliyah (emigration) to israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most jews who have moved to the jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-semitism and persecution in their native countries.

unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from jewishness. the fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. we will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very jewishness differently. jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.

people are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. many studies, from the mckinsey global institute, california's legislative analyst's office and others, have shown that california's high home prices are largely a supply problem: the state doesn't build enough homes.

china, of course, has loomed over elections in taiwan ever since the former japanese colony transitioned to democracy after decades of authoritarian rule following the arrival of chiang kai-shek's kuomintang forces in 1945. in this campaign, china has done more than ever to make its preferences clear — and, critics say, to stoke polarization among taiwan's 23 million people.
the deal was quietly sealed in the final weeks of last year. by then, china had changed and so had the world. the trans-atlantic relationship has been damaged by president trump, with new doubts in europe about american constancy and in america about europe's ambitions.

general suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between iran and iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of world war i. nearly a million people died on both sides, and general suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.
ms. pelosi said of the cabinet. she said she hoped to have an answer from mr. pence by the end of the day on whether he would attempt to use the 25th amendment. the two leaders tried to call the vice president directly on thursday but were left on a holding line for 20 minutes without him picking up. it was unclear how quickly democrats could move to impeach mr. trump. there is no clear precedent for putting a former official on trial in the senate, and with only 13 days left in his term, it was not certain democrats could actually accomplish such a complicated and politically fraught process on a compressed timetable. mr. schumer, the top democrat in the senate, said: what happened at the u.s. capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the united states, incited by the president. this president should not hold office one day longer. andrew bates, a spokesman for the biden transition, did not take a stand on the 25th amendment or impeachment. president-elect biden and vice president-elect harris are focused on their duty — preparing to take office on jan. 20 — and will leave it to vice president pence, the cabinet and the congress to act as they see fit, mr. bates said. in the meantime, donald trump must stop blocking cooperation with the transition that could harm the readiness of the united states government to overcome the pandemic and the other crises he has worsened.

but even as some economists and politicians become more comfortable with high public debt levels, others warn that they could create vulnerabilities down the road. if interest rates increase, it could cost the government more to keep up with those payments each year — either leaving less for other types of spending or requiring congress to pile on an ever-growing debt load to keep up.

his education was high school diploma level, and he got swept up in the revolution, in the promise of islam becoming the foundation of a government, and of promises to empower the oppressed and low-income class in iran, which had been neglected and sidelined under the pro-western monarchy of the shah. so general suleimani gets a job at the local water plant and volunteers for the local chapter of the revolutionary guards, and quickly rises up and shows a lot of promise as a military man. when the war with iraq happened in the 1980s, he was a commander for eight years. and after the war ended, he was named the commander of the quds forces. and that was really the beginning of the quds forces, and the islamic republic's ambition to create a paramilitary in the region, and to kind of export the idea of an islamic revolution of shia dominance outside of the borders of iran.

it is worth noting, as it is relevant at the current moment, that misinformation from the candidates themselves was not considered a major shortcoming of political advertising on fb in 2016 even though our policy then was the same as it is now. these policies are often covered by the press in the context of a profit motive. that's one area i can confidently assure you the critics are wrong. having run our ads business for some time it just isn't a factor when we discuss the right thing to do. however, given that those conversations are private i think we can all agree the press can be forgiven for jumping to that conclusion. perhaps we could do a better job exposing the real cost of these mistakes to make it clear that revenue maximization would have called for a different strategy entirely.

hank paulson is returning to finance, lured by bono to head a climate-focused fund. henry paulson, the former treasury secretary, in 2019. he will become the executive chairman of new fund run by the investment firm tpg. credit... tiffany hagler-geard/bloomberg, via getty images henry m. paulson jr., the former goldman sachs chief and treasury secretary during the 2008 financial crisis, is rejoining the finance industry. he will become the executive chairman of tpg rise climate, a new fund run by the investment firm tpg. the move brings mr. paulson, 74, back to the industry for the first time since he left goldman to become treasury secretary in 2006 under president george w. bush. it may also signal a turning point for the weight and seriousness given to climate-related investments, already a focus for tpg. the firm's co-founder, jim coulter, is planning to shift much of his focus to the new climate fund. mr. paulson has spent the last 12 years since leaving his post at the treasury away from the private sector, running his nonprofit institute and working on climate change initiatives. he was recruited to tpg, in part, by bono, the musician and activist who helped found tpg's $5 billion rise funds focused on impact investing. he told mr. paulson that the investment firm wanted to create an even bigger platform to focus exclusively on combating climate change. i wasn't looking to do this, mr. paulson said.
jack kelly's the edge of anarchy: the railroad barons, the gilded age and the greatest labor uprising in america opens in may 1893 with president grover cleveland surveying the half-million citizens who had filled the chicago world's fair, the most astounding metropolis ever built. the columbian exposition, as it was known, was a celebration of the 400th anniversary of columbus's arrival in the new world as well as the productivity of american commerce. four days after the fair opened, the bottom dropped out of the united states economy, which was further crippled that summer by an increasingly ferocious depression.

one of the big political advantages that business enjoys is that it is continually able to recruit good players and send them to play every game worth playing in the american political and legal system. and there are a lot of games worth playing. those games might entail having key language inserted into a piece of legislation as it gets finalized by congress, or sending a top-notch legal team to federal district court when a favorable way of interpreting a particular statutory provision is potentially at stake, or making sure that business views are amply reflected in the epa's notice-and-comment rule-making process. and those are just some of the games that are being played at the federal level.
re for doctors, age may be more than a number, by haider javed warraich (sunday review, jan. 7):
liberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don't like the timing. mr. bernstein, no one's idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the united states run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. that creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.
the total raised by ms. warren in the final three months of the year was lower than the $24.6 million she raised from july to september. last week, her campaign had signaled her lagging fund-raising effort for the quarter, which echoed her slip in the polls over the same period. days before the end the year, her campaign took the unusual step of going public with its financial performance, announcing that it had raised just over $17 million and conceding that it will be nearly impossible to match last quarter at this point.

certitude can easily become an enemy of tolerance but also of inquiry, since if you believe you have all the answers, there's no point in searching out further information or making an effort to understand the values and assumptions of those with whom you disagree. it's worth noting, too, that our checks-and-balances system of government assumes that none of us has all the answers and therefore no single person should be trusted with complete authority.

warnock beats loeffler in georgia senate race. the rev. raphael warnock at a campaign event in columbus, ga., last month. credit... audra melton for the new york times atlanta — democrats moved a major step closer to capturing control of the senate on wednesday morning as georgia voters elected the rev. raphael warnock, the pastor at the storied ebenezer baptist church, in a hard-fought runoff contest that became roiled by president trump's false claims of voter fraud in the state. mr. warnock's victory over the republican incumbent, kelly loeffler, was called by the associated press early wednesday. it represented a landmark breakthrough for african-americans in politics as well as for georgia: he became the first black democrat elected to the senate from the south. for democrats to take the senate, which is crucial to enacting president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s first-term agenda, they also need to win georgia's other senate runoff held on tuesday. with an estimated 98 percent of votes counted in that race as of 4 a.m. wednesday, the republican candidate, david perdue, trailed his democratic rival, jon ossoff, by 12,806 votes. turnout in rural, overwhelmingly white counties where republicans needed a strong showing was lagging without mr. trump on the ballot, and many of georgia's heavily black localities saw turnout levels that neared those of the presidential race in november.

lawmakers end republicans' effort to subvert the election in an early morning vote. lawmakers stood in objection to the vote certification on wednesday during a joint session of congress. credit... anna moneymaker for the new york times congress rejected an attempt from republicans to overturn the will of pennsylvania voters early thursday, effectively ending a final attempt from insurgents to turn a loss for president trump in the state into a win. the house rejected the challenge by a vote of 282 to 138, after a long debate dragged past 3 a.m. in washington. a scuffle almost broke out on the chamber floor after representative conor lamb, democrat of pennsylvania, delivered a particularly fiery speech in condemnation of the republican objections. that attack today, it didn't materialize out of nowhere, mr. lamb said. it was inspired by lies, the same lies you're hearing in this room tonight, and the members who are repeating those lies should be ashamed of themselves. by a vote of 92 to 7, the senate turned back the pennsylvania challenge shortly before 1 a.m., as the number of objections to the counting of electoral college votes dwindled after the mob's brazen effort to keep president trump in office, despite his decisive election loss in november. those senators voting against the results of the presidential election in pennsylvania were: josh hawley of missouri, ted cruz of texas, tommy tuberville of alabama, cindy hyde-smith of mississippi, roger marshall of kansas, cynthia lummis of wyoming and rick scott of florida.
credit credit... erin schaff/the new york times senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the most powerful republican on capitol hill, forcefully rebuked president trump and members of his own party on wednesday as they sought to reject president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory, warning that the drive to overturn a legitimate election risked sending democracy into a death spiral. in a lengthy speech defending his intention to vote against challenges to mr. biden's victory — which he framed as the most important vote i have ever cast — mr. mcconnell urged his republican colleagues ready to follow the president to step back from the brink. he called some of mr. trump's claims sweeping conspiracy theories and implicitly rebuked a dozen or so senators justifying their objections to the results by saying they were merely acts of protest. the voters, the courts and the states have all spoken, mr. mcconnell, the majority leader, said. if we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever. he added a short time later: if this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. but even as he spoke, there were signs outside the capitol that the country was already in the throes of such a vicious cycle. mr. mcconnell, who was the first senator to rise in a debate over objections to electors from the state of arizona, spoke as thousands of demonstrators massed outside the capitol, clashing violently with the police and ultimately storming the building where congress convenes.
global roundup hong kong ends ban on birth partners in public hospital delivery rooms, and other news from around the world. a testing center in hong kong last month. under the new rules, which take effect next week, birth partners will be allowed if they have tested negative for the coronavirus within the past 72 hours. credit... miguel candela/epa, via shutterstock officials in hong kong on friday reversed a contentious pandemic restriction that had barred birth partners from delivery rooms in public hospitals, forcing women to give birth alone. announcing the change, dr. au yeung kam-chuen, chairman of the hong kong hospital authority's coordinating committee for obstetrics and gynecology, said, we consider the accompanying person can help soothe the emotions and reduce painkilling needs for pregnant women during delivery, and will not affect the operation of the labor ward too much. officials said the restriction had been lifted in response to feedback from women and their partners, many of whom were prevented from meeting their children until several days after they were born. everyone is just absolutely overjoyed at the news, and honestly a little bit stunned that all our campaigning has worked, said lindsey ford, an expectant mother who had drawn attention to the issue. under the new rules, which take effect next week, birth partners will be allowed if they have tested negative for the coronavirus within the past 72 hours. women in labor were already required to be tested upon arrival at the hospital.
iraqi politics sometimes goes to the precipice only to pull back. that could still happen here, especially given that kurdish and sunni leaders boycotted the vote. but it is difficult to see how american forces can stay to conduct their mission if the iraqi parliament, as well as inflamed iraqi militias, now wish them gone. iraqi political factions have previously tried to expel american forces only to fall short. but this time is different. after popular protests against corruption, iraq's political leadership is the weakest it has been in 15 years. so are the ties between american and iraqi leaders.

the meanings of many words and phrases in the constitution are not at all obvious. examples include right, unreasonable, probable cause, due process, excessive, cruel and unusual and equal protection. even if we could find clear definitions of these terms in a dictionary, current or historical, applying these definitions to cases that the founders did not anticipate only expands the range of ambiguity (and therefore interpretive possibilities).

in his new year's message 12 months ago, mr. kim sounded defiant, saying that his country would slog through the sanctions and build a self-reliant economy, even if that meant that his long-suffering people would have to tighten our belts again. he vowed to boost the nuclear weapons program further, threatening to end his moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests. he said north korea would unveil a new strategic weapon soon and shift to a shocking actual action.

the growing tension with iran is merely the latest, most acute example of mr. trump's impulse toward global destabilization. whether it's his abandonment of the kurds in syria, his antagonism of america's allies, his coddling of hostile autocrats, his disdain for multilateral agreements or his manipulation of america's ukraine policy for his own political gain — a move that led to his becoming the third president ever impeached — this president has given americans reason to abandon their complacency on foreign affairs and increase their concern about mr. trump's frightening style of leadership.

jon ossoff wins in georgia, ensuring democrats will control the senate. jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock campaigning in atlanta. both defeated their republican opponents, assuring that the balance of power in the senate will shift. democrats took control of the senate on wednesday with a pair of historic victories in georgia's runoff elections, assuring slim majorities in both chambers of congress for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. and delivering an emphatic, final rebuke to president trump in his last days in office. the rev. raphael warnock defeated senator kelly loeffler, becoming the first black democrat elected to the senate from the south. and jon ossoff, the 33-year-old head of a video production company who has never held public office, defeated david perdue, who recently completed his first full term as senator. both democrats now lead their defeated republican opponents by margins that are larger than the threshold required to trigger a recount under georgia law. the democrats' twin victories will reshape the balance of power in washington. though they will have the thinnest of advantages in the house and senate, where vice president-elect kamala harris will break 50-50 ties, democrats will control the committees and the legislation and nominations brought to the floor. that advantage will pave the way for at least some elements of mr. biden's agenda.
in these moments people like to suggest that our consumers don't really have free will. people compare social media to nicotine. i find that wildly offensive, not to me but to addicts. i have seen family members struggle with alcoholism and classmates struggle with opioids. i know there is a battle for the terminology of addiction but i side firmly with the neuroscientists. still, while facebook may not be nicotine i think it is probably like sugar. sugar is delicious and for most of us there is a special place for it in our lives. but like all things it benefits from moderation.

once researchers sift through all the data, it's possible that the variant will turn out to be just 10 to 20 percent more transmissible, said trevor bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle. even so, dr. bedford said, it is likely to catch on rapidly and become the predominant form in the united states by march. the variant behaves like earlier versions. so far, at least, the variant does not seem to make people any sicker or lead to more deaths. still, there is cause for concern: a variant that is more transmissible will increase the death toll simply because it will spread faster and infect more people. the routes of transmission — by large and small droplets, and tiny aerosolized particles adrift in crowded indoor spaces — have not changed. infection with the new variant may increase the amount of virus in the body. some preliminary evidence from britain suggests that people infected with the new variant tend to carry greater amounts of the virus in their noses and throats than those infected with previous versions. that finding offers one possible explanation for why the new variant spreads more easily: the more virus that infected people harbor in their noses and throats, the more they expel into the air and onto surfaces when they breathe, talk, sing, cough or sneeze.

ezekiel is, understandably, still scarred by the former. within the show's broader narrative the characters each trace their own paths toward postapocalyptic self-actualization — see also: carol's ongoing ethical vision quest. sometimes the trick is getting these arcs to align in order to achieve larger goals. plus from a narrative standpoint, there are seven weeks left in the season and it would be too easy if ezekiel went along with the plan now. but he'll have richard, young benjamin, perhaps eventually carol and definitely daryl in his ear, advocating for action.

by tuesday, mr. trump's message to republicans to get out and vote appeared to resonate. turnout is high, said lane lewis, 44, as he waited to enter the precinct. you can tell because there's never a line. the reliance on election day turnout is a risky proposition for republicans, who must contend with georgia's changing population and growing urban areas that increasingly vote democratic. it was also a forced choice — considering much of the republican base is echoing mr. trump's concerns about voter fraud in the presidential election — when it comes to absentee voting, and many have expressed similarly unfounded doubts about the senate races. mr. lewis said he waited until election day to vote because he trusted it would be counted then. he also said he believed ms. loeffler and mr. perdue would benefit from republicans like him, who hold conservative values but have sometimes been put off by mr. trump's language. when asked if he thought mr. biden won georgia in november, mr. lewis said, i have doubts. some have described their voting choices as a desire for balance or an aversion to having one party controlling two houses of government. joy phenix, 55, voted for gridlock. they need a backstop, she said outside a polling place in the affluent atlanta suburbs in east cobb county, where a modest line of voters shuffled through all morning.

two pieces of canadian history lie behind sharon bala's debut novel, the boat people. the first involves the arrival — in august 2010 — of the merchant vessel sun sea at equimalt naval base in british columbia, carrying hundreds of sri lankan asylum seekers. the second involves the internment of almost 24,000 canadian citizens of japanese origin in the slocan valley by the british columbia security commission between 1941 and 1949.
mr. obama's own speech in 2009 reads a little like an inversion of the trump administration's view. here are some points of comparison:
for the first time, mr. rodríguez-lópez said, he decided to take the audience into account while writing music. when you're honoring the creative element, you're very susceptible to going in any direction that might come in as an influence, he said. but now we have to think about, let's see the personality of at the drive in, let's see what the context is, and let's see how we find a good middle ground between where we are now and what the band is. like, metallica can't put out a reggae record, you know what i'm saying?

but peter feaver, a former national security council official under mr. clinton and president george w. bush who now teaches political science at duke university, said mr. trump has taken these clashes to a new level.
jews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. but today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. the continuity of the most influential jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.
i would look foolish if i did that, mr. trump responded after senator chuck schumer of new york, the democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. he said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.
i can't understand how the authors of the friday article can assume that yale has to be so haughty not to allow this type of pledging to go on at yale, the newspaper quoted mr. bush as saying.
or maybe you would work less. after all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. who needs that promotion when you're able to keep more of the money you already make?
what does all of this say about the nature of the algorithmic rewards? everyone points to top 0.1% content as being acutely polarized but how steep are the curves? what does the top 1% or 5% look like? and what is the real reach across those curves when compared to other content? i think the call for algorithmic transparency can sometimes be overblown but being more transparent about this type of data would likely be healthy.
a potentially larger challenge in any democratic effort to reduce inequality is that allied interest groups and individual donors — as progressive as they are — focus on issues that are not necessarily about reducing inequality for the poor and working class. instead, the emphasis is often on social issues such as abortion and civil rights, or protecting the environment.

kayleigh mcenany, the white house press secretary, claimed that the entire white house abhorred the violence that mr. trump himself had incited, then walked off without answering any questions. she spoke for two minutes in the white house press briefing room and did not mention the president by name, or his speech that set the violence at the capitol in motion. all of this unfolded amid the strange silence of a trump-free twitter, with the president's account temporarily locked after he tweeted praise for the mob that had ransacked the capitol, leading to at least four deaths. mr. trump returned to twitter late on thursday after his suspension lifted and he posted a two-minute video that addressed the violence and acknowledged that a new administration would be sworn in on jan. 20. maggie haberman contributed reporting.

americans will debate the american drone strike that killed the iranian commander maj. gen. qassim suleimani for a long time: whether it was wise, what it means for the middle east, and how to proceed. but so far, the most dramatic consequences have arisen from where the strike happened — in iraq. it appears that in undertaking the strike, the trump administration may have sacrificed a valuable american counterterrorism partnership with iraq at the altar of a risky pressure campaign against iran with no end in sight.

pressure on trump intensifies as resignations and criticism roil waning days of his presidency. trump supporters on wednesday left broken windows, doors and furniture in the capitol, as well as a defaced bust of president zachary taylor. credit... jason andrew for the new york times with less than two weeks before president-elect joseph r. biden jr. takes the oath of office, it seemed on thursday that the wheels might finally be coming off the trump administration. in 24 hours, congress reconvened in a capitol breached and battered by a pro-trump mob, formalized mr. biden's victory over the objections of more than 100 republican lawmakers and found itself on the brink of impeaching president trump a second time. a growing cohort of legislators, including at least one republican, expressed support for stripping mr. trump of his powers under the 25th amendment, even as vice president mike pence — who would have to lead that process — was said to oppose the idea. on capitol hill, the number of republicans willing to publicly defend mr. trump dwindled. one, representative adam kinzinger of illinois, said he supported the invocation of the 25th amendment; another, representative steve stivers of ohio, said he would not oppose the move if cabinet members decided to proceed. several high-ranking administration officials announced that they would resign including two cabinet members, a late and purely symbolic gesture by people who had stood by mr. trump even as he promoted baseless claims of election fraud and repeatedly refused to accept his loss.
republicans across the government denounce the violence, and in some cases, trump for encouraging it. senator mitt romney furiously denounced president trump for encouraging the chaos, which he called an insurrection. credit... pool photo by erin schaff vice president mike pence and other top republican leaders denounced the violence on capitol hill on wednesday, as president trump's efforts to encourage the mob of his supporters to leave peacefully drew criticism for not being forceful enough. the violence and destruction taking place at the us capitol must stop and it must stop now, mr. pence wrote on twitter. this attack on our capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, he continued. many of the other republicans who sought to distance themselves from the mob violence on wednesday had previously tolerated or outright encouraged efforts to subvert the results of the election. peaceful protest is the right of every american but this attack on our capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. — mike pence (@mike_pence) january 6, 2021 senator ted cruz of texas, the first republican senator to object to the certification of the election results during a joint session of congress on wednesday, denounced the storming of the capitol building on twitter, insisting that violence is always wrong. he did not, however, withdraw his objections to the results of the election. those storming the capitol need to stop now, mr. cruz wrote.

as the police led the lawmakers down stairwells and into the subterranean maze of tunnels to a secure location, mr. crow said he called his wife in colorado, who had been watching the terrifying scene on television. the shouts of the mob could be heard outside the doors of the senate as the trespassers breached the building. the police whisked vice president mike pence off the dais and out of the chamber. as it became clear the senate chamber was not safe, security officers ordered the senators to leave. they hustled through the tunnels of the capitol with an armed police escort. aides snatched the boxes containing the electoral college certificates, making sure that the vandals could not literally steal the results of the election. before long, the invaders were inside the senate chamber, prowling among the mahogany desks and even sitting on the marble dais where mr. pence had been seated not long before. in the early afternoon, the police fired what appeared to be flash-bang grenades. rather than disperse, the demonstrators cheered and shouted, push forward, push forward. one person shouted, that's our house, meaning the capitol. other people repeatedly shouted, you swore an oath. as protesters circled the house chamber, representative steve cohen, democrat of tennessee, yelled out to republicans: call trump, tell him to call off his revolutionary guards. it's horrible that this is america. said representative norma j. torres, democrat of california, as the capitol's emergency sirens blared.
how has the pandemic changed your taxes? will stimulus payments be taxed? nope. the so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. in fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the recovery rebate credit. the payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague ann carrns wrote. read more. are my unemployment benefits taxable? mostly. unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the tax foundation). but you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for social security and medicare. the new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. this applies to 2020 only. (if you've already filed your taxes, watch for i.r.s. guidance.) unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. while the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the i.r.s. or certain states money. read more. i worked from home this year. can i take the home office deduction? probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.

but most of those were held outdoors, and greater numbers of participants seemed to be masked. research afterward suggested that they were not super-spreading events. but hundreds of rioters shouting in crowded rooms and hallways for extended periods of time can infect dozens of people at once, dr. rimoin and other experts said. the melee was most likely a super-spreader event, said dr. joshua barocas, an infectious diseases physician at boston university, especially given the backdrop of the highly transmissible variants that are circulating, the prospect that members of congress may have been exposed, amid an already difficult transfer of power, particularly disturbed some scientists. i am worried not only that it could it could lead to super-spreading, but also super-spreading to people who are elected officials, said dr. tom inglesby, director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university. representative jake laturner, republican of kansas, announced on twitter early thursday morning that he had tested positive for the virus. mr. laturner was cloistered in the chamber with other members of congress for much of the day.
those engaged in violence are hurting the cause they say they support. representative kevin mccarthy of california, the top republican in the house and an early supporter of efforts to overturn the results of the election, called the violence on capitol hill unacceptable and un-american. i condemn any of this violence. i could not be more disappointed with the way our country looks right now, mr. mccarthy said in an appearance on fox news, adding that he had called on the president to make a statement against the violence. this is not the american way. this is not protected by the first amendment. this must stop now. senator mitt romney, republican of utah and an outspoken opponent of efforts by republicans to subvert the election results, furiously denounced mr. trump for encouraging the chaos. in a statement condemning the rioting hours later, mr. romney said that lawmakers should not be intimidated by the acts of violence, and he called on congress to continue certification of the election results. we gather today due to a selfish man's injured pride and the outrage of his supporters who he has deliberately misinformed, mr. romney wrote. we must not be intimidated or prevented from fulfilling our constitutional duty. secretary of state mike pompeo and national security adviser robert c. o'brien, top members of mr. trump's national security team, condemned the riots in statements released later in the evening. the storming of the u.s. capitol today is unacceptable.

police response to capitol mob is in striking contrast to protests after george floyd killing. the police response on wednesday was strikingly different than during the summer protests as a mob stormed the capitol. credit... samuel corum/getty images during the protests after the killing of george floyd in may, president trump vowed to dominate demonstrators, calling them extremists and thugs, while federal agents deployed tear gas and swept people into unmarked vans. peaceful protesters in lafayette square were suddenly met with flash grenades and chemical spray and rushed by police officers in riot gear to clear the way for president trump to pose with a bible in front of st. john's church. mr. trump said that anyone who breached a security fence outside the white house would encounter the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, i have ever seen. the tone, and the initial law enforcement response, were strikingly different on wednesday as a lawless and destructive mob of his supporters stormed the capitol and disrupted the counting of the electoral college votes. one video appeared to show capitol police officers moving aside barriers and retreating as the mob flooded through. inside the capitol, an officer pleaded with a man in a green backpack, saying, you guys just need to go outside. when asked why they weren't expelling the protesters, the officer said, we've just got to let them do their thing now.

brown approached the problem as a risk manager, which meant doing what no school has been known to do before: buying insurance to protect against a sudden drop in chinese enrollment. the three-year policy requires the university to pay $424,000 annually for up to $60 million in coverage. the insurer, lloyd's of london, will pay out a claim if a specific incident — a visa ban because of a government action, for example — causes the number of chinese students in the colleges of business and engineering to decline by 18.5 percent over a 12-month period. the political risks have only grown since the policy went into effect. the trade war with china, visa restrictions and the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from the white house are making it more complicated for international students to come to america. it's a tough environment right now, brown says. but the insurance gives him peace of mind. the school continues to invest in china, he says, but now with the confidence that we are not doubling down on risk.
after the clerical abuse scandal exploded in 2002, the conference of major superiors of men adopted its own reforms following the united states conference of catholic bishops. orders added victim assistance offices and background screenings for candidates, and hired accrediting companies to audit their sexual abuse responses.
when mr. luo stepped down as party chief in shanxi, in november, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province's political ecology and overhaul its economy, two tasks that mr. xi may also want him to take on in hong kong. mr. luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of mr. xi and other central leaders.

investors are also banking on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines to eventually energize business activity that has been dormant during the pandemic, and, as they have for months, also looked past fresh evidence of the economic catastrophe unfolding. on thursday, the labor department reported that 922,000 workers filed new state claims for unemployment benefits last week, while another 161,000 new claims were filed under a federal program. the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury note rose above 1.07 percent. while that is remarkably low by long-term historical standards, it is the highest level for yields since march, when the arrival of the coronavirus sent global markets into a tailspin. it's a reflection that there's going to be more stimulus. there's going to be bigger supply, and there's a bigger risk of inflation, said james bianco, president of bianco research, a financial market research firm based in chicago. economists at goldman sachs said they expected democrats to pass $750 billion in fiscal stimulus in the first quarter of the year. the u.s. investment bank also raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 6.4 percent from 5.9 percent. matt phillips and

among the many questions raised by the killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani, perhaps the most pressing is, why? yes, general suleimani was responsible for hundreds of american deaths, and he may have been planning another attack on united states forces. but the greater concern, raised by people from tucker carlson on the right to elizabeth warren on the left, is how this provocative act fits into america's overall interests — in other words, our grand strategy.

in that case, a moderate increase in the inflation target or significantly greater reliance on active fiscal policy for economic stabilization, might become necessary, mr. bernanke said in a speech delivered in san diego at the economics profession's biggest annual meeting.
effectively managing the white house has been a challenge for all modern presidents. one prerequisite is an ability to articulate a policy vision and persuade senior advisers to develop and carry it out. mr. trump's visible lack of control over the white house is in part rooted in his lack of firm policy beliefs — about immigration, gun control or foreign policy. chaos is rampant in the trump white house largely because the president is weak and easily manipulated by those who have access.
it will become a tool in their diplomatic alliances, and it will give them some measure of prestige and standing with countries that choose to make use of them, he added.
historically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. but given the growing importance of the u.s. competition with china, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.
ultimately, what i enjoy most about watch collecting is the emotional and intellectual rush i get from learning things that are not widely known and then the great reveal to my other collector friends. one of the great joys of collecting is really the people you will meet, and though there is always some mild competition among friends, the support from this group of people is really something very special and one that is not found in many other areas. watch collecting is also a fun way to hone your critical mind and provides a nice vehicle to support international travel – above all else, it is a lot of fun. the minute it stops being fun, you should stop.
job postings and hiring reflect a rocky recovery. even with the arrival of vaccines, employers are still cautious related to their work force strategy, said amy glaser of the staffing firm adecco usa. credit... bryan anselm for the new york times while the availability of vaccines will speed the economy's return to normal, employers remain wary about hiring, job recruiters say. job postings and hiring typically fall off at the end of december, and the trend after the latest holiday season has been more pronounced than usual. right now, employers are still cautious related to their work force strategy, said amy glaser, senior vice president at the staffing firm adecco usa. the rebound has been bumpy, and employers have responded in kind, retaining flexibility to increase or reduce their staffing through the use of temporary workers, ms. glaser said. that could mean more people are cycling through jobs. julia pollak, a labor economist at the online job site ziprecruiter, has seen the same caution. employers are being apprehensive, and job seekers are not yet flocking back to the market in droves, either, ms. pollak said. the virus is still spreading, hospitalizations have hit a new record, and there is a pullback in demand for certain services. a lot of stay-at-home orders and restrictions are causing a further decline. some industries have managed to thrive. a key measure of manufacturing, for instance, rose this week to its highest level since 2018. construction spending and employment have grown along with a surge in home buying.
in december, president trump made an extraordinary declaration about u.s. involvement in syria: we have won against isis. now, it's time for our troops to come back home. ignoring advice from his generals and advisers, trump said that the u.s. would leave syria. defense department officials said that they were ordered to do it within 30 days. [explosion] then came a flurry of criticism, even from inside his own party. i believe it is a catastrophic mistake. this is very disappointing. it needs to be reconsidered. then, the resignations. first, defense secretary jim mattis quit. and america's chief diplomat in the fight against isis, brett mcgurk, soon followed. now, the timeline for a full withdrawal is unclear. i never said we're doing it that quickly. he went on to say that the u.s. will leave at a proper pace while continuing to fight isis, a shift from — they're all coming back, and they're coming back now. the nearly eight-year-long war in syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. [explosion] so, how did we get here and what are u.s. forces doing in syria? in 2011, uprisings rippled through the middle east. leaders fell in tunisia, libya and egypt. and after months of anti-government protests in syria, the u.s. had a message for president bashar al-assad: this morning, president obama called on assad to step aside. he didn't and the conflict escalated. in 2012, obama warned assad against using syria's stockpile of chemical weapons against his own people.

both the senate and house would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. vice president pence, who was evacuated from the capitol, should seriously consider working with the cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. most of those calling for mr. trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were democrats, but there were some exceptions. governor phil scott, republican of vermont, said on twitter that mr. trump should be ousted. the fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. enough is enough. president trump should resign or be removed from office by his cabinet, or by the congress. read more
our prime minister is on the wrong side of the exodus story. but the people of israel — a country built by those who fled hitler's ovens and the oppression of arab countries where they were treated as second-class citizens — understand the injustice of the government's policy in our bones. it is why 36 holocaust survivors wrote a letter to the prime minister begging him to learn the lesson of our history. it is why israelis from all parts of society — doctors, diplomats, rabbis, artists — have opposed this policy. it is why some el al pilots have announced that they will refuse to fly planes bearing africans being deported.

some 20,000 of the refugees have already left the country. the mission now, as prime minister benjamin netanyahu put it bluntly, is to deport the rest. and so the government is offering the remaining refugees this choice: jail in israel or $3,500 and a plane ticket to a third country, like rwanda, in africa.
two things stand out about the foreign policy messages mr. trump has posted on twitter since taking office: how far they veer from the traditional ways american presidents express themselves, let alone handle diplomacy. and how rarely mr. trump has followed through on his words. indeed, nearly a year after he entered the white house, the rest of the world is trying to figure out whether mr. trump is more mouth than fist, more paper tiger than the real thing.
d.c. officials urge residents to avoid potentially violent protests by trump supporters. a supporter of president trump walked toward freedom plaza near the white house on tuesday. credit... kenny holston for the new york times the local authorities in washington are cautioning residents to avoid potentially violent agitators who are expected to gather downtown on wednesday to amplify president trump's false claims of voter fraud in the general election in november. chief robert j. contee iii of the metropolitan police department said the police had received information that people intended to show up to the demonstrations armed, a violation of local firearm laws. mr. trump is expected to appear at the rally on wednesday and has encouraged his supporters to travel to washington for the event. some of mr. trump's allies, including the conspiracy theorist and conservative radio host alex jones and some associates who recently received a pardon from the president, spoke to hundreds of people who crowded into the city's freedom plaza on tuesday, one day before congress begins the formal counting of the electoral college votes. a spokeswoman for the eighty percent coalition, which was publicizing the event on tuesday, did not return requests for comment. tensions already began to escalate on tuesday night, with some of mr. trump's supporters clashing with police near black lives matter plaza, videos of the confrontation showed. the police used pepper spray to repel some of the demonstrators.
i think a lot of us who were very hawkish and believe in american military might and strength were very resistant to how candidate trump characterized the wars, mr. hegseth said in another recent telephone interview. but if we are honest with ourselves, there is no doubt that we need to radically reorient how we do it. how much money have we invested, how many lives have we invested and has it actually made us safer? is it still worth it?
that was such a bad decision from the court, mr. trump asserted, that even his predecessor, when he signed the daca, with the executive order, made a statement to the effect, this isn't going to work. (president barack obama did not sign an executive order to implement the deferred action for childhood arrivals program. he announced it as a department of homeland security policy in a speech in 2012. he did not say it would not work, but called it a temporary stopgap.)
calling it one of the darkest days in the history of our nation, mr. biden forcefully laid blame at the feet of mr. trump, pointing to his conduct not just in the aftermath of the november election, but over the past four years. what we witnessed yesterday was not dissent, mr. biden said. it was not disorder. it was not protest. it was chaos. they weren't protesters. don't dare call them protesters. they were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. it's that basic. it's that simple. and i wish we could say we couldn't see it coming, he continued. but that isn't true. we could see it coming. mr. biden also spoke of how the rioters were treated by law enforcement. no one can tell me that if it had been a group of black lives matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the capitol, he said. we all know that's true, and it is unacceptable. totally unacceptable. the position of attorney general had been the most prominent role in mr. biden's cabinet that was still unfilled with inauguration day approaching. judge garland currently serves on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. president barack obama nominated him to the supreme court in 2016 after the death of justice antonin scalia, but senate republicans blocked his nomination.

during the contentious meeting in the situation room, mr. trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected democrats' proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.

but a long-running bull market has reversed sharply in the past two weeks. central banks appear to be tightening monetary policy, which would raise the cost of borrowing and could eat into corporate profits, and data suggests that wage growth is accelerating in the united states. several days of sell-offs last week pushed the united states stock market into a correction, indicating a severe downward trend.
chris hughes was raised by lutheran parents in hickory, n.c., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and mr. hughes carried that tradition into adulthood. but in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.
cambridge analytica is one of the more acute cases i can think of where the details are almost all wrong but i think the scrutiny is broadly right. facebook very publicly launched our developer platform in 2012 in an environment primarily scrutinizing us for keeping data to ourselves. everyone who added an application got a prompt explaining what information it would have access to and at the time it included information from friends. this may sound crazy in a 2020 context but it received widespread praise at the time. however the only mechanism we had for keeping data secure once it was shared was legal threats which ultimately didn't amount to much for companies which had very little to lose. the platform didn't build the value we had hoped for our consumers and we shut this form of it down in 2014.

variations in policy positions don't really matter because, to paraphrase the president, we are in a national emergency — but the national emergency is him, said lou frillman, who was a major fund-raising bundler for mr. obama's campaigns and is close to mr. biden. the vice president has all the qualities necessary to win, and i think he has all the qualities the country is going to so desperately need to bring us back from the edge.
president trump and his administration have always had a mixed-messaging problem. whether it had to do with the future of nato, relations with the european union, a rapprochement with russia or a trade war with china, mr. trump has made norm-shattering pronouncements while his top advisers worked behind the scenes to preserve the status quo.
woman who was killed during the attack was shot by the capitol police. officers in riot gear lined up in front of the capitol on wednesday night after it was overrun by a mob. credit... kenny holston for the new york times a woman who was fatally shot inside the capitol after it was overrun by a pro-trump mob was struck by gunfire from a capitol police officer, a police official said wednesday night. chief robert j. contee of the metropolitan police department told reporters that the woman had been shot by a police officer on wednesday afternoon as plainclothes police officers confronted the mob. she later died in a hospital, he said, and the shooting is being investigated. at least 14 capitol police officers were injured during the demonstrations on wednesday, chief contee said, including two who were hospitalized. a video posted to twitter earlier on wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the capitol. the woman in the video appeared to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. the woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. a man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of police could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her. where's she hit? people yelled as blood streamed around her mouth.
the founders were not dummies; they knew that society would evolve in unforeseeable ways — morally, socially, politically, technologically — and that this inexorable evolution might well bring about unforeseeable applications of the same words. for example, instead of using the imprecise phrase cruel and unusual to lock in any particular punishment (like the death penalty), it stands to reason that they meant it to lock out whatever punishments future generations deemed unconscionable. so true originalism — genuinely following the founders' intent — requires us moderns to interpret constitutional language in light of our own, not their, moral and linguistic norms.
the targeted killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an mq-9 reaper drone at baghdad international airport was an impressive display of american military prowess. and it liquidated a destabilizing figure: the general was the commander of the quds force, which is responsible for iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. in the scheme of things, he had it coming. yet killing him made little strategic sense for the united states. in some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of american foreign policymaking.

in the aftermath of donald trump's 2016 election victory, analysts fiercely debated the role of the approximately six million voters who supported president barack obama in 2012 but shifted their support to mr. trump in 2016. democratic strategists also had to worry about their future behavior: was 2016 a temporary blip or were these voters gone forever? with newly available data from the cooperative congressional election study survey, the largest publicly-available election survey, we can now analyze what happened with these obama-trump voters in 2018 and what that might portend for mr. trump's re-election campaign.

the cnn reporter implies that this demonstrates how volatile and dangerous general suleimani was. but the f.b.i. was unable to establish that the bombing of the rogers vehicle was an act of iranian terrorism; the case remains open. and the attack on iran air 655 by the vincennes wasn't, in any meaningful sense, accidental — and it killed 290 people, 66 of them children.

credit credit... lena mucha for the new york times the european commission, the executive arm of the european union, announced on friday that it had secured a contract for an additional 200 million doses of the pfizer-biontech vaccine, with an option to add another 100 million, in an apparent response to the growing criticism that the bloc had ordered too little and too late. europe will have more than enough vaccines in a reliable time frame, ursula von der leyen, the commission's president, said during a news conference on friday, stressing that the combined orders of pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines would be sufficient to inoculate 80 percent of the european union's population of about 450 million. defending the commission's actions on ordering doses, ms. von der leyen said that in the summer it had been impossible to know which vaccines would have made it, but that the expansion of pfizer's production capacity illustrates it was right to bet on this particular horse. the new contract could double the number of pfizer-biontech doses secured by the european union from 300 million to 600 million, with the first 75 million ready for dispatch in the spring, though it is now up to member countries to place their individual orders. the original contract, finalized in november, secured 200 million doses with the option for an additional 100 million, which was triggered by the commission in late december.

it may well be that general suleimani had come to iraq in part to plot the next move against united states military personnel or civilians when his car was blown up by a missile from an american reaper drone. abu mahdi al-muhandis, a senior commander of a shiite militia in iraq, was also killed. but then, general suleimani and his whereabouts have long been well known to american and other intelligence services, and presidents george w. bush and barack obama had resisted killing him for fear of setting off a greater conflict with iran and further destabilizing a chronically volatile region.

the rise of isis was a threat to iran. it was an existential threat to the shia government of iran, because isis represented the most extreme version of sunni faith. and again, general suleimani mobilizes. he goes to iraq and he repeats a true and proven formula once again by recruiting volunteers, the instrumental ground force in helping the united states and iraq's army to battle isis. therefore, mr. suleimani, although he's seen as a foe of the united states, in the battle of isis actually becomes a default ally. for general suleimani, the rise of isis was a turning point. he went from being a commander in the shadows, a mystery figure, to being a household name.

even as climate change increases the odds of flooding, construction in high-risk areas continues to increase, often without adequate safety standards. in many coastal states, the most flood-prone areas saw greater increases in home construction than the rest of the state, according to data released in 2019.
how mr. trump sees the killing of general suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on iran is unclear, and on friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the united states and iran do not spiral out of control. general suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in palm beach, fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.
in north korea, kim jong-un's declaration on wednesday that the world would witness a new strategic weapon seemed to be the end of an 18-month experiment in which mr. trump believed his force of personality — and vague promises of economic development — would wipe away a problem that plagued the last 12 of his predecessors.
in an interview on sunday, australian prime minister scott morrison said he would call for a high-level investigation into the government's handling of the country's bushfires, acknowledging the nation's deep frustration with the response. but in the interview, morrison did not call for a significant shift in his government's policies towards carbon emissions.
we make instant judgments about each other based on image all the time. it's human instinct, and part of how we decide if someone is likable or believable or a leader, and it's part of the way our leaders try to influence our feelings about them.

twitter's permanent suspension of trump's twitter account is long overdue, said shannon mcgregor, a senior researcher at the university of north carolina at chapel hill. this is the key de-platforming for trump. the inability to tweet cuts off his direct access to the press — and, by extension, the public. the suspension comes a day after mr. trump was barred from using facebook for the remainder of his term, and on the heels of a number of other digital platforms limiting mr. trump from their services. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. but jason miller, a senior adviser to mr. trump's campaign, called twitter's decision disgusting. big tech wants to cancel all 75m @realdonaldtrump supporters, mr. miller tweeted. if you don't think they're coming for you next, you're wrong. beyond muting mr. trump's biggest megaphone, twitter's decision could create headaches for the trump administration when it comes to complying with the presidential records act of 1978, which requires the preservation of presidential materials and communications. mr. trump has long flouted twitter's terms of use, but until this week, the platform had never suspended him, arguing that his tweets were matters of public interest and should remain available. mr. trump himself never expected that to change. when allies raised the possibility of social media companies banning him, he repeatedly replied, they'll never ban me. maggie haberman contributed reporting. kate conger, mike isaac, maggie astor and
mao zedong, however, was not inclined to reciprocate. this became clear during kosygin's february 1965 trip to beijing. kosygin, the soviet premier, spoke of the need for united action to help hanoi's war effort. mao responded to his pleas with hostile sarcasm, telling kosygin that the sino-soviet struggle would last for 10,000 years. the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. are now deciding the world's destiny, mao said acidly. well, go ahead and decide. he appeared unconcerned by the new round of escalation in vietnam: so what? what is horrible about the fact that some number of people died? — and countered kosygin's worries about the deepening conflict with optimistic calls for a revolutionary war.

a public vote and rapid trial in the senate would give much-needed legitimacy to actions to remove mr. trump from office. by forcing republicans to stand up for democracy and against the president's actions, it would also reaffirm bipartisan support for the fundamental principles of american democracy. further, while the 25th amendment is intended mainly for illness or other objective incapacities, impeachment offers an appropriate moral response to the president's conduct, including incitement to violence and attacks on basic democratic norms.
what people are really upset about is the prime minister's attitude toward the environment and climate change, and his beholdence to coal.
and the crowd also wept very loudly with him. as a reporter who's covered iran for over 25 years, what struck me was that the people who had attended were not just supporters of the regime, but a lot of people who were generally very critical of the regime.

so an unintended consequence of america invading iraq is that it ends up empowering iran.
iranian forces or their proxies were days from attacking american personnel when president trump decided to strike general suleimani, defense secretary mark t. esper told reporters at the pentagon. mr. esper added that general suleimani had traveled to baghdad to coordinate attacks following up on a two-day siege of the united states embassy there last week by pro-iranian demonstrators. he declined to elaborate but called the intelligence exquisite.

mr. kenny also gives credit to the myriad reporters and editors responsible for the articles he mentions. several of the bylines would be familiar to avid times readers; the editors those reporters filed to and fought with and thanked likely are not. the list of names not only acknowledges the many people who produce the times, it also serves as a testament to the hugeness of the world and the number of observers it takes to record, faithfully, the news.
i agree with dr. haider javed warraich. young doctors have many good qualities that have nothing to do with age, for better or worse, but when he writes that nothing is more reassuring to patients than seeing a silver-haired doctor walk up to their bedside, i have to disagree.

in maine, moderate democrats joined republicans to block a red flag firearms bill that would have allowed relatives to petition courts to confiscate firearms from residents if a judge determined they were a risk to themselves or to others. instead, a compromise was approved that generally requires a medical professional to assess mental stability and make that determination.

on the campaign trail, mr. biden has emphasized his decades-long record in international affairs and extensive relationships abroad, highlighting a contrast with his rivals in the democratic field, who have largely been focused on domestic matters throughout the race. in new york, the setting appeared designed to conjure the white house briefing room: mr. biden spoke against a blue backdrop before a room full of reporters. he walked in to the clicking of multiple cameras and offered his own prescription for the path forward, calling for cleareyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in a strategy that's not about one-off decisions and one-upsmanship.

you see, republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy, based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy. this claim rests on research by … well, nobody. there isn't any body of serious work supporting g.o.p. tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.
so far, north korea has qualified only two athletes for the games, the figure skating pair of ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik. they missed a deadline to apply for a spot, but that is expected to be overlooked. the international olympic committee has also indicated a willingness to grant some wild-card entries to other north korean athletes.
the notion that mr. bush is a low-wattage leader seems to be based on two factors.
washington — the trump administration is considering jim webb, a former democratic senator and reagan-era secretary of the navy, to be the next defense secretary, according to three officials, potentially bypassing more hawkish republicans whose names have been floated to replace jim mattis.
sánchez is a short-term solution, too, but the nature of the problem united faces has changed. city is no longer a rising force; it is the league's dominant team. no champion has retained its crown in the premier league since 2009, but so far ahead of its rivals is city currently that it is difficult to see how it will be overhauled in the space of a single season. adding sánchez is both a show of force and a sign of, if not desperation, then certainly urgency.
asked if he would resign if mr. trump asked him to do so, mr. powell replied directly: no.
a company executive said in a blog post late monday that the social network would remove videos, often called deepfakes, that artificial intelligence has altered in ways that would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say. the videos will also be banned in ads.
if that seems curious, consider the circumstances: city was not decisively the best team in england, and perhaps europe, in the summer. raheem sterling had not scored 18 goals in 33 games. put simply, sánchez was worth more to city six months ago than he is now. city missed out on van persie because of its weakness and united's strength. if anything, the converse is true of sánchez.
republicans promise to replace the affordable care act with something better, although they haven't agreed on what that will be. what they can say is that it will be teeming with freedom. with the exception of mr. ryan, theirs is a negative freedom: a drop in the insurance rate would be a positive sign of the personal liberty of not being subject to the individual mandate, for example. their plan will be built on freedom and individual responsibility. a constraint would be lifted. who cares if uninsured people suffer because they can't get medical care?

as part of accelerated pacification, the c.i.a. created the phoenix program to root out the viet cong infrastructure. critics of phoenix have called it an assassination program, aimed at viet cong cadres as well as innocent civilians. besides killing guilty and innocent alike, phoenix also provided local officials and policemen a sanctioned program to abuse power with false arrests, settling of scores and extortion. phoenix did seriously damage the viet cong infrastructure, but the cost was high for the government as well, since the program sowed fear, resentment and distrust among the population.

the seeds that led to the insurrection were hidden in plain sight. at mr. trump's rallies, where his supporters set up open-air markets of hate and conspiracy, selling confederate flags and t-shirts that mock his opponents and the media. in conservative news outlets, where the language of revolution and civil war is commonplace. on mr. trump's twitter feed, which has amplified white supremacists, anti-semites and anti-muslim extremists.
rapid virus testing will ramp up inthe u.s., as f.d.a. approved three new at-home kits. health officials hope the increased use of rapid tests will help in the fight against the pandemic. credit... abbott, via agence france-presse — getty images amid surging coronavirus cases, the top u.s. testing official on thursday announced another scale-up in the country's diagnostic efforts, touting the importance of tests that can run from start to finish outside the lab. the government will allocate an additional $550 million to community-based testing programs across all 50 states, said adm. brett giroir, the assistant secretary for health. the government will also put $300 million toward 60 million kits for federal distribution to nursing homes and other vulnerable communities. dr. giroir projected that the country's capacity for non-laboratory testing could more than double by june. in a video livestream, dr. giroir held up three new at-home testing kits, designed by ellume, abbott and lucira health, that recently received emergency green lights from the food and drug administration. all can deliver results in a matter of minutes after a quick nasal swab, though only ellume's product can be purchased without a prescription. the abbott and ellume tests search for bits of coronavirus proteins called antigens. lucira's test, like most laboratory-based tests, hunts for genetic material. dr. giroir, who will depart his position on jan. 19 as part of the transition to the biden administration, praised the tests as sophisticated but cautioned that none were yet in widespread use.

the entry of mr. biden would immediately upend the still-nascent primary: ms. warren joined the race last week and three dozen other democrats are considering it. mr. biden could crowd out other establishment-aligned contenders like former mayor mitch landrieu of new orleans and former gov. terry mcauliffe of virginia, given that mr. biden's donor base and supporters may overlap with some of their own. and mr. biden's allies are themselves mindful of another democrat whose blue-collar credentials could pose a challenge to their own coalition: senator sherrod brown of ohio.

boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a legal settlement with the justice department stemming from the 737 max debacle, the government said on thursday. the agreement resolves a criminal charge that boeing conspired to defraud the federal aviation administration, which regulates the company and evaluates its planes. with less than two weeks left in the trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a biden justice department would view a settlement off the table. president trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company.

there were other projects, too — mr. rodríguez-lópez has released dozens of solo albums — along with ruptures. at one point, mr. bixler-zavala and mr. rodríguez-lópez completely stopped speaking to each other. at the drive in reunited to play festivals in 2012, but then fractured again. in 2013, mr. rodríguez-lópez told cleveland scene: playing together again was to close the chapter on that era. we played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. when playing those songs, i thought, here's a person at the time that i don't relate to anymore. he didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world.
the new balance of power would also make it easier for mr. biden's cabinet appointees to win confirmation, as well as for democrats to increase the budgets of federal agencies and pump money into clean energy research and development. it also would greatly increase the likelihood that congress would incorporate portions of mr. biden's $2 trillion climate plan into new economic stimulus legislation as well as an infrastructure package.

the rebellion could affect future corporate donations. in a new ad, the lincoln project, an anti-trump republican group, accused mr. cruz and mr. hawley — as well as senators tom cotton of arkansas and rand paul of kentucky, who have promoted the president's election fraud contentions but haven't committed to the certification challenge — of attempting to suppress millions of votes, and called out the corporate america titans who are funding them, naming at&t, charles schwab and citigroup. if that creates reputational issues, companies may think twice about donations to challengers in 2022 — and beyond.

the most notable of roosevelt's white house conferences, on dependent children, took place a few weeks before he left office. the idea came from a young lawyer who had grown up in an orphanage and was pressing for governmental subsidies to widowed mothers, whose poverty often forced them to place their children in orphanages. roosevelt issued the invitations on dec. 25, 1908, a date surely not chosen at random.

in a five-page letter sent on monday, the government watchdog group, common cause new york, requested that the city's campaign finance board and its conflicts of interest board look into the mayor's actions and those of the groups, which, common cause asserts, run afoul of broadly worded sections of the city charter and of campaign finance law, as well as the spirit of those regulations.

during nuclear negotiations in 2005, a north korean diplomat let slip an unexpectedly candid comment, offering valuable insight into his government's nuclear policy: the reason you attacked afghanistan is because they don't have nukes. and look at what happened to libya. that is why we will never give up ours.

if we are to counteract this trend, we must understand the dynamics of contemporary assimilation and not confuse them with past episodes of assimilation, which were based largely on the perceived need to escape from the burdens of jewish identification. today, there are no burdens from which to escape. being jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. jews today assimilate not because christianity or islam is better or easier, but because jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. jews do not convert to christianity; they convert to mainstream americanism, which is the american religion closest to judaism. they see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. most jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a jewishness they know little about. they associate the judaism they are abandoning with inconvenient rituals and rules that have no meaning to them. as one young woman remembers her jewishness: an old man saying no.
still, the official said, the president is mindful enough of the arguments against potentially tanking the stock market that he has been somewhat open to a move to narrow the scope and effects of the tariffs while avoiding the perception that he was relenting. that would echo the approach the administration took to winding down the president's promises on the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, program, which has protected young immigrants brought illegally to the united states as children.
republicans and democrats locked arms to denounce the violence and express their determination to carry out what they called a constitutionally sacrosanct function. to those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win, mr. pence said in a sharp break from mr. trump, who had praised the mob. violence never wins. freedom wins. and this is still the people's house. senator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, said the failed insurrection had only clarified congress's purpose. they tried to disrupt our democracy, he said. they failed. the upheaval unfolded on a day when democrats secured a stunning pair of victories in runoff elections in georgia, winning effective control of the senate and the complete levers of power in washington. and it arrived as congress met for what would normally have been a perfunctory and ceremonial session to declare mr. biden's election. the siege was the climax of a weekslong campaign by mr. trump, filled with baseless claims of fraud and outright lies, to try to overturn a democratically decided election that he lost. we gather due to a selfish man's injured pride, and the outrage of supporters who he has deliberately misinformed for the past two months and stirred to action this very morning, senator mitt romney, republican of utah and the 2012 presidential nominee, said after the chamber reconvened. what happened here today was an insurrection incited by the president of the united states.
in the meeting, ms. nielsen also gave the full briefing she had prepared to give democratic leaders last week in the situation room, outlining what the white house has described as a crisis at the border. several democrats in the room, according to the white house official, said they agreed with her that a humanitarian border crisis did exist. but the democrats who were interviewed said the two sides remained far apart about what constituted the correct response to a humanitarian crisis.
that's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. a year later, assad's army launched a chemical attack on a damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] in response, the u.s. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. but a new threat was also emerging — isis. in 2014, the u.s. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. these efforts expanded and the u.s. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. in 2016, u.s.-supported fighters took control of the isis stronghold of manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, raqqa. there are now around 2,000 american forces in syria who are largely fighting alongside the kurdish groups. this has been a problem for america's ally turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the kurds. u.s. troops have had run-ins with assad's forces as well as groups backed by russia and iran. since taking office, trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. we are prepared to sustain this response, until the syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. u.s. officials and allies dispute the claim that isis has been defeated. they warn that an american departure will weaken u.s. influence in the region and may embolden russia, iran and turkey, who are also on the ground. the other worry?
like nelcy and her daughters, the new arrivals from central america are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. asylum seekers bottled up in mexico are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. two sick migrant children have died while in custody.
in effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through, the judge, an obama appointee, wrote in his 14-page opinion. justice department lawyers had argued that the restrictions were necessary to curb abuse of an asylum system that they said was overwhelmed with frivolous claims. immigrant advocates and lawyers said that the policy would have spelled the demise of the u.s. asylum system. the rule would have been the death knell for many asylum seekers, said stephen yale-loehr, a professor of immigration law at cornell law school. the court's decision today leaves the door open for people fleeing persecution. the rule would have gutted the u.s. asylum system and violated both u.s. and international law, he said.
georgia is still conflicted about whether we should vote at all, mr. crane said. data from early voting showed that the turnout in the runoff election was depressed in heavily republican areas of the state, though analysts say that republicans tend to favor voting on election day while democrats are more likely to cast their ballots early.
we are also preparing for the possibility that the government won't back down and that this deeply anti-jewish policy will be carried out. that is why last month i and others founded a movement called miklat israel, or israel sanctuary. hundreds of israeli families, plus many kibbutz communities, are opening their homes to asylum seekers who face the gruesome choice of deportation or prison. we will protect whoever we can. that is why some have referred to it as the anne frank movement.
what's next: no date or location is set for the next round of talks. higher-level discussions could occur in davos, switzerland, if president trump attends the world economic forum meeting there, starting jan. 22. but he may cancel if the partial government shutdown is not resolved by then. china's economic czar is expected to visit washington sometime after that. the trump administration has set a march 2 deadline to wrap up negotiations, after which it says it could raise tariffs.

for chelsea, though, pulisic's appeal had not faded. aside from the likely marketing benefits of employing the most high-profile american player of his generation, marina granovskaia, the director who oversees the premier league team's transfer activity, described the signing as something of a coup for pulisic's on-field qualities.

under the governor's proposal, developers who set aside 25 to 30 percent of a project's apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants, can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years, compared with less generous subsidies in either the 2015 legislation or the mayor's proposal.
greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. hence, this study reveals a self‐reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.

more national security officials resign from a white house in turmoil. five more national security council officials resigned their jobs at the trump white house over the past few days, administration officials confirmed on friday. the departures add to the list of trump officials who have left since a mob of trump supporters violently stormed and ransacked the capitol on wednesday. the officials are rob greenway, senior director for middle eastern and north african affairs; anthony ruggiero, senior director for weapons of mass destruction and biodefense; ryan tully, senior director for european and russian affairs, mark vandroff, senior director for defense policy; and erin walsh, senior director for african affairs. the exits, which were made quietly and have hollowed out the n.s.c.'s senior ranks, follow the resignation of the deputy national security adviser, matthew pottinger, on wednesday. despite reports that president trump's national security adviser, robert c. o'brien, might also exit, officials said that he intends to remain on the job. many of the resignations were first reported by reuters. mr. ruggiero's was first reported by defense news and mr. tully's by bloomberg. spokesmen for the n.s.c. did not respond to requests for comment.

my hope for 2019 is that all u.s. citizens will have fair and affordable access to health care services. i worked as an r.n. case manager for years, both on the insurance side and hospital side. maybe people don't realize the burdens of pre-existing conditions, health care services caps or young people not being able to get insurance. i hope for legislators who see the need to take care of their citizens, and that this country will have the stamina, concern and willpower to provide health care to all. — georgia stapleton, shawano, wis.

in a clear sign that he intends to take a tough posture against president vladimir v. putin of russia, mr. biden plans to nominate victoria nuland, a retired career diplomat and former top state department official for russia affairs under mr. kerry, as under secretary of state for political affairs. ms. nuland, a fierce critic of mr. putin, is despised by the kremlin, and her confirmation is sure to anger the russian president as mr. biden plans to both firmly confront and seek to find common ground with moscow.

three top u.s. health officials decided against resigning over the pro-trump riot. dr. robert r. redfield, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention, is said to have considered stepping down after the violence at the capitol this week. credit... anna moneymaker/the new york times three of the nation's top health officials — including dr. robert r. redfield, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention, and dr. stephen m. hahn, the commissioner of the food and drug administration — considered resigning on thursday in the wake of the pro-trump riot at the capitol, according to two officials who heard about private conversations they had. seema verma, the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, also contemplated leaving her post, according to the same pair of officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. but ms. verma, dr. redfield and dr. hahn ultimately decided against departing, believing it would be too disruptive in a pandemic and could compromise some last-minute work at their agencies. the conversations ms. verma, dr. redfield and dr. hahn had about resigning were part of a still-growing fury at the department of health and human services over the mob president trump incited to storm the capitol building. the fallout yielded at least one resignation: dr. elinore f. mccance-katz, the head of the substance abuse and mental health administration at h.h.s., gave notice on thursday.

the estimate, by the research firm rhodium group, pointed to a stark reversal. fossil fuel emissions in the united states have fallen significantly since 2005 and declined each of the previous three years, in part because of a boom in cheap natural gas and renewable energy, which have been rapidly displacing dirtier coal-fired power.

there is little effective contact tracing in the united states, and many in the crowd at the capitol arrived from communities far from washington. the black lives matter protests in the summer raised similar concerns. but most were held outdoors, and greater numbers of participants seemed to be masked. research afterward suggested these were not super-spreading events. attendees of the rally preceding the rush to the capitol on wednesday also stood outdoors close together for hours, but i'm less worried about what was happening outdoors, dr. rimoin said. the risk increases exponentially indoors. read more

we must recognize that many of the factors which have fueled current assimilation and intermarriage are positive developments for individual jews: acceptance, wealth, opportunity. most jews do not want to impede these developments. indeed, they want to encourage them. for that reason, we must accept the reality that many jews will continue to marry non-jews, but we should not regard it as inevitable that these marriages will necessarily lead to total assimilation. we can take positive steps to stem that tide--but it will take a change in attitude toward mixed marriages, and indeed toward the tribalism that has understandably characterized jewish attitudes toward outsiders for so much of our history.
it's a glaring example of how unjust this system really is, said mx. martinez, noting the disparity between the hundreds of arrests on the highway versus the handful of arrests at the capitol. if that had been us, there would have been way more than one casualty.
over the next 10 years, we're probably going to see the introduction of self-driving cars. whoever owns one is going to send it out to run all sorts of errands, many of them with no one in the car. those empty personal cars aren't going to care about sitting in traffic. we need to charge a price that makes owners think twice about sending out a car during peak times with few or no people inside.

during his senior season at perry high school outside phoenix, purdy received scholarship offers from new mexico state and u.n.l.v., which compete in so-called group of five conferences — in the same football bowl subdivision as the major powers, but a rung below power leagues like the southeastern conference and the big ten. in december, boise state, the most successful group of five team of the past decade, asked purdy to become a bronco next fall.
the commerce department, which has nearly 50,000 employees, has used its vast power during the trump administration to curtail the access of chinese companies, including the telecom giants huawei and zte, to the american market and technology. it also carried out investigations into the effect of imported steel and aluminum on the domestic industry, which led to mr. trump to impose global metal tariffs on european and other countries.
i also bring to this book a unique perspective informed by my experiences growing out of the publication of chutzpah five years ago. since that time, i have spoken to well over 100,000 jews in nearly every city with a significant jewish population, not only in this country but throughout the world. the talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. i estimate that i have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned jews. i have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from jewish men, women, and children. i have also been teaching young students, many of them jewish, for a third of a century. i have served as faculty adviser to the harvard jewish law students association, have been an active participant in hillel, and have spoken to jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. over these years, i have discussed virtually every jewish issue--from god to intermarriage to israel to anti-semitism to jewish feminism--with thousands of students. these questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of jews. it has been quite an education. i think i understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many jews, of all ages, and i try to address myself to these concerns in this book.
an aside: what if we take into account the reality that markets aren't perfectly competitive, that there's a lot of monopoly power out there? the answer is that this almost surely makes the case for even higher tax rates, since high-income people presumably get a lot of those monopoly rents.

suleimani was treated like royalty, and was not particularly hard to find, said marc polymeropoulos, a former senior c.i.a. operations officer with extensive counterterrorism experience overseas. suleimani absolutely felt untouchable, particularly in iraq. he took selfies of himself on the battlefield and openly taunted the u.s., because he felt safe in doing so.

pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, mr. trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas.

bleach bank notes in the sun, balke says. one scientist has suggested letting ultraviolet light do the work by laying out the cash on the central bank's roof. (we'd rather keep it in the vault, balke says.) most bills will remain intact in the washer and dryer. but while a wash cycle may make your money look untainted, it nonetheless ruins the bills; hot water can damage security features, and detergents change the way cash reflects light, which currency-sorting machines detect. banks shred washed money.

mr. liu is expected to lead a sizable delegation to washington. he would be the second politburo member to visit the city so far this month. yang jiechi, china's top diplomat, arrived this month but made little headway at a time when the mood in washington has shifted toward strong concern about china's rapid military buildup and record trade surpluses with the united states.
we turned off the moral lens. you probably know the example of the israeli day care centers. parents kept showing up late to pick up their kids. to address the problem, the centers experimented with fining the late parents. but the number of late pickups doubled. before, coming to pick up your kid on time was a moral obligation — to be fair to the day care workers. after, it was seen as an economic transaction. parents were happy to pay to be late. we more or less did this as an entire society — we switched to a purely economic lens.

wall street journal editorial board urges trump to resign to avoid second impeachment. the editorial board of the wall street journal, normally a supporter of president trump, wrote that it would best if he stepped down. credit... jeenah moon for the new york times the editorial board of the wall street journal, the american flagship of rupert murdoch's newspaper empire, denounced president trump on thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the u.s. capitol, declaring his behavior impeachable and encouraging mr. trump to resign his office to prevent a second impeachment by the democratic-controlled house. in an unsigned article titled donald trump's final days, the journal's editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election and said this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure. if mr. trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign, the journal wrote, concluding, it is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly. the journal's editorial page, led by the editor paul gigot, has criticized mr. trump in the past, sometimes harshly. but its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president by a news outlet controlled by mr. murdoch, whose fox news cable network is home to several of mr. trump's most loyal and longstanding media defenders.

administration officials have chosen the latter, following the war-on-terror playbook. they consider the strike a targeted killing, elaborating that it was justifiable as an act of self-defense. general suleimani, officials say, was actively plotting a big action that would have cost hundreds of lives, thus posing an imminent threat. others, such as senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, have rightly rejected the term targeted killing and called it an assassination, implicitly raising a question about the legality as well as the wisdom of the strike.

according to both mr. lett's lawyer and the judge, dora l. irizarry, the government cannot decide to criminally prosecute immigrants and then keep them locked up on immigration detainers, if, as their cases proceed, they are granted bail. to do so, they said, was to take what amounted to a second bite of the apple, one that skirted the constitutional protections of the criminal-justice system by using the separate immigration process to obtain a result they failed to get the first time.

assassinating general suleimani, moreover, was not the same as hunting down osama bin laden or abu bakr al-baghdadi, the leaders of al qaeda and the islamic state, both terrorists who answered to no government. general suleimani was a senior official of the islamic republic of iran, and openly targeting him was a sharp escalation in the conflict between the united states and iran, all but taunting iran to strike back. and that by a president who had previously demonstrated strong aversion to american involvement in the middle east, contempt for intelligence from the region and occasional reluctance to order the use of military force.

by the time the 2020 election kicks into highest gear, trump will have been president for more than three years, barring his impeachment, his resignation or his spontaneous combustion (with him, you never know). we'll have evidence aplenty to demonstrate that he's ineffective and incompetent, an approach more likely to have traction than telling voters that he's outrageous. they already know that.
los angeles county urges ambulance crews not to bring to hospitals patients they cannot resuscitate. paramedics in los angeles county loading a potential covid-19 patient into an ambulance before transporting him to a hospital in hawthorne, california last month. credit... apu gomes/agence france-presse — getty images with hospitals in los angeles county swamped with covid-19 patients, a memo that went out to the county's ambulance crews last week caused public alarm and prompted explanations from medics on social media about their care practices. in the memo, a slightly updated version of which was released on monday, the county emergency medical services agency instructed the crews not to transport most adult patients whose hearts had stopped beating to a hospital if resuscitation in the field was unsuccessful or if the patients met established criteria for declaring death. the measure was needed due to the severe impact of the covid-19 pandemic on e.m.s. and 9-1-1 receiving hospitals, dr. marianne gausche-hill, the agency's medical director, wrote in the directive. what the memo actually reflected, though, was an effort to spare overburdened emergency rooms from having to spend time and resources on patients who were already beyond their help. and rather than a dire last resort, it was actually a relatively small change from the county's previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from taking most patients whose heartbeats could not be restored where they were found to the hospital.

when i speak to older jewish audiences, i am often accused, sometimes stridently, of minimizing anti-semitism and am told that it is worse than ever. social scientists call this dramatic disparity between the reality of declining anti-semitism and the widespread belief that it is increasing a perception gap between what is actually happening and jewish sensibilities. some of the jews who believe this are similar in this respect to some feminists and black activists i know, who insist that the plight of women and blacks is worse than it ever was. these good and decent people, whose identities are so tied up with their victimization, are incapable of accepting the good news that their situation is improving. it is not even a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. they see the glass as broken, even though it is intact and quickly filling up. as the sociologist marshall sklare puts it: american jews respond more readily to bad news than to good news.

the new infections were detected after the plane landed in new zealand; the country requires incoming travelers to quarantine for 14 days before entering the community. the analysis, led by researchers at the new zealand ministry of health, found that seven of the 86 passengers on board tested positive during their quarantine and that at least four were newly infected on the flight. the aircraft, a boeing 777-300er, with a capacity of nearly 400 passengers, was only one-quarter full. the seven passengers, from five countries, were seated within four rows of one another for the 18-hour duration of the flight. two acknowledged that they did not wear masks, and the airline did not require mask-wearing in the lobby before boarding. nor did it require preflight testing, although five of the seven passengers who later tested positive had taken a test, and received a negative result, in the days before boarding. the researchers found that the passenger whom they believe initiated the outbreak had in fact tested negative, but four or five days before boarding. four or five days is a long time, dr. karan. you should be asking for results of rapid tests done hours before the flight, ideally.

boston — the hasty pudding theatricals, an irreverent harvard theater troupe that has not cast women since it began staging productions in 1844, announced on thursday that, for the very first time, it would encourage women to audition this year.
on paper, prospects are bullish. chinese children will be responsible for around half of the global growth in milk formula sales in the next five years, according to euromonitor. china's decision to relax its one-child policy and the increase in women reaching for baby formula as they head out to work should bode well for mead.
there's good news and bad news on this week's list of recommended books. well, almost exclusively bad news, at least in terms of subject matter. these picks cover the devastation of tsunamis, earthquakes and wildfires; the spanish flu epidemic of 1918; mass extinctions; the potential for nuclear annihilation. even the work of fiction included here is a fantasy about imminent catastrophe. the good news is the eloquent and haunting way in which these books are written.
in 2006, a number of retired military officers publicly rebuked defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld for his handling of the iraq war. in 1993, president bill clinton was at odds with military officials over allowing gay men and lesbians in the military. and there was a hefty amount of distrust between president barack obama and military officials over the administration's approach to iraq and afghanistan.
in his first meeting about a shutdown with representative nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer in the oval office last month, the president forcefully said that he alone would own the shutdown. on friday, he was selling shares in it. you can call it the schumer or the pelosi or the trump shutdown, he said. doesn't make any difference to me. it's just words.

while some analysts believe that the elements of the taliban close to iran will now feel pressured to deliver on iran's behalf, the diplomats said they hoped the taliban would try to avoid being dragged deeper into another conflict at a time when they were so close to a deal.
the notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. they were designed to united states customs and border protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture.
one of the most painful things for her about being home, she said, was being unable to finish her education because the government deemed her unfit ethically, because i wasn't a good practicing muslim. her family, upper-middle-class and educated, had physicians and educators in its ranks. it was a devastating realization.
it's not calling for another crash like the stock market suffered just over a decade ago. or for another run like the last 10 years, where the s&p 500 returned more than 13 percent on an annualized basis. a gain less than half of that may be more likely, both for next year and annually for the coming decade.
the targets of the union's activism are chosen strategically, either because they further one of the union's narrow interests — special hotel permits, casino expansion — or demonstrate its political organizing strength.
it is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like uber and lyft, which happen to be its competitors. in november, for instance, two women sued uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in florida and california. and last month an uber driver in beirut, lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of rebecca dykes, a british diplomat.
both newspapers obtained the report. neither provided details of the alleged assault.
serhiy kivalov, a ukrainian lawmaker known for pro-russian initiatives, took photos of the dance, as well as of his coveted tickets and passes to the soiree where it took place, the liberty ball at the walter e. washington convention center, posting them on facebook and declaring that it was an honor to attend.

at the people's house in washington, a predominantly white mob in support of president trump's attempts to overturn the election overtook the capitol building by brute force. confederate flags flew at the seat of american democracy. a gallows was erected, with a noose hanging in the air. it was as stark a contrast as any, one day that illustrated the nation's original paradox: a commitment to democracy in a country with a legacy of racial exclusion.

as long as there aren't enough covid-19 vaccines for everyone, it's unlikely the biden administration will allow a massive influx of refugees and asylum seekers into the country. these months of vaccine scarcity will hopefully provide the administration the time it needs to formulate and execute a new immigration policy that can address the crisis.
so if you're looking for imminence, you need look no further than the days that led up to the strike that was taken against suleimani, mr. pompeo said.
julián castro is the latest democrat to drop out of the 2020 presidential race. he will probably receive more press coverage today and tomorrow than he has on any other day since he announced his candidacy. but unlike other democrats who have thrown in the towel, mr. castro should continue to have a significant impact on the presidential campaign.

pompeo condemns violence as world leaders offer strong reactions to the scene in washington. a mob crawling the walls at the capitol on wednesday. credit... jason andrew for the new york times images beamed around the world of trump supporters storming and vandalizing the united states capitol elicited alarm from the nation's allies — and glee from its critics. this is not merely a us. national issue, but it shakes the world, at least all democracies, said peter beyer, the german government's coordinator for trans-atlantic affairs. in france, a member of the european parliament, nathalie loiseau, sounded a warning that evoked the political battles in her own country. a message to those who find populists amusing or are indifferent to them: this is what they are capable of, she wrote on twitter. later wednesday evening, secretary of state mike pompeo condemned the violence and said on twitter that storming the capitol was unacceptable. lawlessness and rioting — here or around the world — is always unacceptable, mr. pompeo said. months after the black lives matter protests put racial tensions and police bias in the united states into the international spotlight, some observers were quick to see the assault in washington as a further breakdown of law enforcement. analysts on mexican television pointed out that the members of the mob were overwhelmingly white, noting that the police response to black or latino protesters would likely have been more violent.
grace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. mr. ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. he continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life.
trump briefly reappears on @potus handle hours after twitter permanently suspends his personal account. president trump's twitter account was permanently suspended last friday after he incited his supporters to invade the capitol in a riotous mob. credit... jim wilson/the new york times twitter said on friday that it had permanently suspended president trump from its service due to the risk of further incitement for violence, effectively cutting him off from his favorite method of communicating with the public and capping a series of actions by mainstream sites to limit his online reach. in a blog post explaining its decision, twitter said that trump supporters had been using the platform to plan additional attacks like the one on the capitol on wednesday — including, it said, a proposed secondary attack on the u.s. capitol and state capitol buildings on jan. 17 — and that mr. trump's posts had encouraged his supporters in those plans. a little more than two hours later, mr. trump, using the twitter handle @potus, wrote that twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, twitter employees have coordinated with the democrats and the radical left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me. but moments after the tweet appeared, it was made unavailable. it was one of at least four tweets put out on the account that were removed. the move came two days after supporters of mr. trump stormed the capitol, leading to at least five deaths.
as jews and israel become more secure against external threats, the internal threats are beginning to grow, as graphically illustrated by the recent assassination of an israeli prime minister by a jew, the growing conflict between fundamentalist jews and more acculturated jews, the increasing trends toward intermarriage and assimilation, and the decline of jewish literacy.
this year especially so, in light of all of the disruptions and problems that we've had, mr. inhofe said.
the challenge isn't expected to delay the inauguration on jan. 20, but it turns a routine process into a political showdown. those who spoke up against the move did so in stark terms:
brussels — the european union embarked on a trade deal with china believing that engagement with beijing was the best way to alter its behavior and make it a committed stakeholder in the international system. but that was seven years ago.
in the first chapter of this book, i focus on what is probably the most whispered-about subject among american jews today: intermarriage and how to cope with this growing reality. i try to bring this controversial subject out of the closet in all its dimensions. i do not moan and groan and wring my hands. i do not present a religious agenda. i explore the issue from both a demographic and a personal perspective, in an effort to understand it and deal with it instructively and realistically. my analysis and conclusions will be controversial and will, i hope, stimulate a debate within the jewish community and beyond. my goal is to ask all the hard questions, and to provide a wide variety of responses in addition to my own. i know that many readers will disagree with me, but i hope they will not be able to ignore the challenges i pose.
we have learned--painfully and with difficulty--how to fight others. can we develop jewish techniques for defending against our own success?

the move to the latin alphabet accelerated in april with the establishment by mr. nazarbayev of a national commission for the modernization of society, which included a panel of linguists entrusted with working out how kazakh sounds should be transcribed.
today, even without whatever oil and gas lie beneath the refuge's coastal plain, the united states is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. many major banks have adopted policies against financing oil development in the refuge because of the risks involved, and there is no guarantee that arctic refuge oil would not be shipped overseas. what is necessary is a focused and swift transition to clean energy. there are plenty of other places to acquire fossil fuels as that transition takes place.
another crucial element is experimentation. this is something we ignore in the west — how unexpectedly flexible china's deeply bureaucratic system can be. this flexibility has been demonstrated in the ability to set up pilot projects in special economic zones, in local tests — such as for housing reform or bankruptcy in state enterprises. very difficult measures were regularly tested in pilot projects for several years before national laws were enacted.
taxed at 25 percent, those savings are worth about $1.9 billion in today's money — half the value of the 30 percent premium that reckitt is handing to mead shareholders. add the savings onto mead's expected earnings for 2020, and the return on reckitt's total investment is just over 5 percent — short of the 7 percent cost of capital typical for a large consumer goods group. reckitt, run by rakesh kapoor, says the purchase will exceed its cost of capital after five years. that will depend on increasing sales in the $46 billion global infant nutrition market.
the lure of the smugglers in reynosa is not limited to central americans. mexicans, too, employ their services, although the cost is lower — the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrant's home country.
the democrats have to deal with robert byrd and his nattering little rule that hasn't gone away, said rodney whitlock, a vice president at mcdermott+consulting and a former health aide to senator chuck grassley who worked on reconciliation bills during his senate tenure.
what steve meant by this, i think, is that the world is unfathomably complex. to believe we have mastered it in all respects — that our angle of vision on matters like politics, philosophy and theology is just right all the time — is ridiculous. this doesn't mean one ought to live in a state of perpetual doubt and uncertainty. if we did, we could never speak up for justice and moral truth. it does mean, however, that we're aware that what we know is at best incomplete. we see through a glass darkly is how st. paul put it in one of his letters to the corinthians: we know only in part.

mr. spires is one of the hundreds of gay former military personnel who have been emboldened by the 2010 repeal of the united states military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. in 2011, the federal government allowed changes to veterans' military records, some of which had been labeled undesirable or other than honorable.
as a recently retired general and vascular surgeon who was privileged to be part of the training of some 240 surgical residents, i feel qualified to comment. i happily admit that the training went both ways all those years. i'd like to think the benefits were mostly in favor of the residents. after all, they learned when, why and especially how to operate. and most important, when not to operate.
commerce secretary wilbur ross tweeted a six-word statement in the hours after the riot on wednesday: violence is never the proper solution.
since the end of the reagan administration at least, departing presidents have requested the resignations of political appointees, who account for about 4,000 of the federal government's 2.1 million employees. their timely departure helps prevent a personnel bottleneck immediately after the inauguration that would occur if departing employees were still being processed just as new administration appointees were coming in.

we can also allow his challengers to talk about themselves as much as they do about him. in 2016, carpenter said, that didn't happen. it was deeply unfair, she told me. when the whole news cycle was microphones shoved in republican candidates' faces and the question was always, 'what's your reaction to what trump just said?,' there's no way to drive your own message.

states that set out a decade ago to trim prison costs have learned that success lies in a few areas — rolling back draconian sentencing that drove up prison populations in the first place, and remaking parole and probation systems, which have, in numerous cases, sent as many or even more people to jail for rule violations as the courts do for new crimes.

a congressional debate authorizing first use would have to be very hurried, and this process could speed up hostile actions rather than slow them down. and when the executive branch has occasionally sought support for war-making powers, congress has seen fit to provide that backing, rather than deny it.
jack nicas and keith collins exposed the way apple's algorithms kept apple services ranked high in the app store. midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. apple representatives told jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors.
it's possible, they figured, that vaping might encourage more people to smoke, by providing a new way to try nicotine for the first time. it might also cause people who might have quit to just keep smoking, by providing a second way to get nicotine where smoking is restricted. the natural experiment of the minnesota tax helped them measure what some overall effects really were.
the concern is genuine, warranted and appreciated. we, the polish jewish community, are weathering challenging times. the country we call home can feel a little less welcoming these days. on one hand, young people who only recently discovered their jewish roots have eagerly joined newly opened hillel student organizations in warsaw and krakow. but they hold in the back of their minds a question of what the future may bring.
white house officials said mr. bolton came into his job determined to streamline the national security council, which they said had become bloated during the obama administration, with functions that often overlapped those of the agencies. they insist his approach was welcomed: during his first breakfast with defense secretary jim mattis, one official said, mr. mattis asked mr. bolton to hold fewer meetings.

mr. trump has been critical of multilateral institutions, and his secretary of state, mike pompeo, delivered a provocative speech in brussels on dec. 4 in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations and institutions like the united nations and the european union. mr. pompeo then asked whether the european union was ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in brussels.
it requires mr. trump to use that time wisely. he should start by abandoning the dangerous notion of turkey seizing areas controlled by kurdish forces and instead allow the kurds — in the absence of long-term american protection — to negotiate an understanding with the syrian regime. this might entail returning some aspects of the syrian state to northeast syria, kurdish forces retaining their military capacity but lowering its profile and a degree of self-governance for the region.
more broadly, the president-elect and his team are setting higher expectations for a legislative agenda now that his party controls congress. efforts like expansion of the affordable care act and an ambitious overhaul of the nation's immigration laws are more likely than they were with the senate in republican control. several immigration advocacy groups issued statements urging mr. biden to quickly put the democratic gains to use.
mr. azar may either collect the data necessary to set payment rates based on acquisition costs, or he may raise his disagreement with congress, but he may not circumvent the mandate of congress, said judge contreras, who was appointed by president barack obama. the government had acknowledged that it did not know the precise amount of the difference between what hospitals were paying for the drugs and what medicare was reimbursing them.

with some of today's older jews, it is exactly the opposite: they refuse to read the good news, even when it is demonstrably true. they insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of judaism, as rabbi moshe waldoks put it. this is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of jew-haters. it is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive jew-hating. we continue to see anti-semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. indeed, some jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. for example, in november of 1996 i saw a fundraising letter from a jewish organization which claimed that anti-semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the holocaust.

the risk, colonel mansoor said, is that whether the criticism is deserved or not, future presidents may be less willing to trust their senior officers, thinking they'll turn on them once they're out of uniform, or they may be less willing to promote officers who are very competent but perhaps independently minded.
but a couple of republicans joined democrats in raising grave questions about mr. trump's strategy, concerns that only sharpened after the briefings on capitol hill by secretary of state mike pompeo, defense secretary mark t. esper, and the c.i.a. director, gina haspel.

yet no major attack against the sprawling and heavily-fortified diplomatic compound in baghdad's green zone is imminent, even though mr. pompeo has asserted that repeatedly, said the official, who discussed administration deliberations only on the condition of anonymity. some pentagon officials had said earlier that there was no intelligence revealing any unusual threats.
that challenge is especially acute when it comes to preparing for the effects of rising seas, worsening storms, spreading wildfires and other consequences of a warming planet. that part of the climate agenda is particularly fraught, according to current and former officials, because it means telling americans to change where and how they live.
steven sund, the capitol police chief, will also leave his position on jan. 16 after ms. pelosi called for his resignation, saying mr. sund, he hasn't even called us since this happened. mr. sund, in his letter of resignation, said he would use his remaining paid sick leave — 440 hours, about 55 days — after departing.
but mr. trump had already drawn criticism from his democratic rivals, and even within his own party, for presiding over a chaotic pullback from syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in iran and iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity. after thursday's attack, the trump administration announced that thousands more troops would deploy to the region in anticipation of iranian action.

but mr. trump's decision to authorize the killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani, which he has described to friends and allies as a necessary action he was forced to take, has opened up a more uncertain political reality as the president enters an election year. that uncertainty was on display tuesday night when iran fired missiles at american forces in iraq, in its first act of retaliation.

and even after the mayhem on capitol hill and efforts by some republicans to object to his election victory, the president-elect continued to sound hopeful about working with both parties and bringing the country together. at an event in wilmington, del., mr. biden introduced a set of top economic officials, saying he had finished naming his cabinet and had fulfilled his promise to assemble a group that looks like america. mr. biden introduced gov. gina raimondo of rhode island as his nominee for commerce secretary, mayor martin j. walsh of boston as his selection for labor secretary and isabel guzman, a former obama administration official, as his choice to lead the small business administration. he also introduced a former aide, don graves, as his pick for deputy commerce secretary. mr. biden said he had given serious consideration to nominating one of his former primary rivals, senator bernie sanders of vermont, for labor secretary. but mr. biden said he and mr. sanders agreed that they could not imperil democratic control of the senate by prompting a special election for mr. sanders's seat. the president-elect spoke amid new evidence that the country's economic recovery had faltered, with the labor department reporting on friday that employers cut 140,000 jobs in december as virus cases across the country increased. the nation's economy still has roughly 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic.
it's a compelling narrative, and one congruent with the story of american carnage that brought donald trump to the white house. aware of that fact, bacevich is at pains to stress his disgust at the current president, whom he views as a demagogue capitalizing on the failure of these illusions rather than offering any kind of helpful response. in the course of breezily narrating the deficiencies of the past four presidencies, he breaks periodically to remind the reader what an unedifying spectacle trump was making of himself at each point in time, and how that spectacle exemplified something ugly about the america aborning.
for allegations of criminal sexual conduct, the board's memo called for a new policy allowing the board to notify the appropriate district attorney's office — a step beyond its current practice of only notifying the internal affairs bureau — though it said the high burden of proof in such cases means prosecutors often cannot or will not pursue them.
the new political calculations were on display just hours after the results of the georgia races were clear on wednesday, when mr. biden revealed he had selected judge garland of the federal court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit as attorney general. before tuesday's elections, some democrats had expressed worry that choosing judge garland would allow a republican-controlled senate to replace him on an important court. now that democrats are in control, that is no longer a concern.

one possible outcome is that a spooked iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the islamic republic's thinking, says the iranian-american journalist masih alinejad. for 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. it may now take its time to reassess that view.

the person is the criminal, not the weapon. gun owners may be a minority, but they're a very focused and vocal minority. only about 3 in 10 americans own a gun. but to them, gun control is not merely a policy issue — it's personal. nearly 40 percent say they always have a loaded firearm at the ready in their home. 74 percent say the right to own a gun is essential to their freedom. gun owners are much more likely to contact lawmakers about gun policy, compared to non-owners, and far more likely to donate to gun advocacy and policy groups. no. 3: the n.r.a. is a formidable force in politics. less than 20 percent of gun owners in america say they belong to the n.r.a., but it's big enough, and disciplined enough, to turn elections and to end political careers. part of what makes the n.r.a. so formidable is the money it spends helping friendly politicians and attacking those deemed enemies. ross voted against your gun rights. the n.r.a.

japan declares a state of emergency for the tokyo area. video facing a rapid rise in coronavirus cases, prime minister yoshihide suga of japan declared a state of emergency for tokyo and three surrounding prefectures. credit credit... pool photo by kiyoshi ota tokyo — japan declared a state of emergency in tokyo and three surrounding prefectures on thursday, after days of record coronavirus counts and a rapidly rising death toll. it was japan's first emergency declaration because of the pandemic since april. the announcement came five days after governors from the affected prefectures had pleaded with the central government to act. prime minister yoshihide suga, reluctant to hurt the economy, had hesitated to invoke the emergency measure, but he eventually bowed to the pressure. deaths from the virus in japan have doubled in less than two months, passing 3,700, and tokyo's governor has warned that the medical system is under stress. polls have shown widespread dissatisfaction with mr. suga's four-month-old administration and its handling of the pandemic. the emergency declaration, which will last one month, relies mostly on voluntary compliance, and health experts warned that it might not be enough to turn the tide. the government is asking restaurants to close by 8 p.m., employers to encourage staff members to work from home, and residents to refrain from going out for all but the most essential tasks — also after 8 p.m. schools, museums, cinemas, gyms and shops will stay open.

at play in all three cases is a tension between the bail reform act, which protects defendants' rights to be released before their trials, and the immigration and nationality act, which gives the government the power to detain and deport people who are in the country illegally. though appeals courts have not yet addressed the conflict, judge irizarry wrote in one of her orders that criminal cases legally take precedence over deportation efforts, adding in the other that the government cannot proceed on a dual criminal prosecution and deportation track.

first, vice president pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke section 4 of the 25th amendment in order to make a declaration that mr. trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. this would immediately suspend, but not remove, mr. trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint mr. pence as acting president. the 25th amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.

two arthritis drugs are found to reduce deaths of critically ill covid patients. a patient arriving at a hospital in london on thursday. new guidance in britain encourages health care providers to use two arthritis drugs to treat severely sick covid-19 patients. credit... andy rain/epa, via shutterstock the british government on friday issued new guidance encouraging health care providers to use two arthritis drugs to treat severely sick covid-19 patients, after the release of promising data from a clinical trial that has not yet been published in a scientific journal. the paper reported that treatment regimens that included the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not take the drugs. based on those results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 i.c.u. patients treated early with the drugs. all of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care. as far as interventions go, that's really good, said dr. ilan schwartz, an infectious-disease physician at the university of alberta, canada. the findings make the pair of drugs, which act on the immune system, some of the only treatments — apart from steroids like dexamethasone — that have reduced covid deaths in a rigorously designed clinical trial. (most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
many have also been silent on the issue of rising drug prices, even as the issue has enraged patients, who have been increasingly exposed to the prices that pharmaceutical companies set as insurers have asked them to pay a greater share of their drug costs. last summer, patients and their families loudly protested the skyrocketing price of epipens, though the movement gathered steam on social media rather than through traditional patient-advocacy groups.

in doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to forge a united front with allies against china's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with beijing and check its rising power. the image of mr. xi joining chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and other european leaders in a conference call on wednesday to seal the deal with the european union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the trump administration's efforts to isolate china's communist party state.

in that case, however, why do we care how hard the rich work? if a rich man works an extra hour, adding $1000 to the economy, but gets paid $1000 for his efforts, the combined income of everyone else doesn't change, does it? ah, but it does — because he pays taxes on that extra $1000. so the social benefit from getting high-income individuals to work a bit harder is the tax revenue generated by that extra effort — and conversely the cost of their working less is the reduction in the taxes they pay.

credit credit... erin schaff/the new york times congress confirmed president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory early thursday morning, hours after a mob of loyalists urged on by president trump stormed and occupied the capitol, disrupting the final electoral count in a shocking display of violence that shook the core of american democracy. president trump, who spent months stoking the anger of his supporters with false claims that the election was stolen and refused to condemn the violent protesters on wednesday, said early thursday that he would respect the results of the election. even though i totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on january 20th, he said in a statement. mr. trump's comments came moments after mr. biden's victory was certified shortly before 4 a.m. by a joint session of congress presided over by vice president mike pence. there was no parallel in modern american history, with insurgents acting in the president's name vandalizing speaker nancy pelosi's office, smashing windows, looting art and briefly taking control of the senate chamber, where they took turns posing for photographs with fists up on the dais where mr. pence had just been presiding. by the time the senate reconvened late on wednesday evening, hours after lawmakers had been evacuated from a capitol overrun by rebels carrying pro-trump paraphernalia, one of the nation's most polarizing moments had yielded an unexpected window of solidarity.

for a sense of the extent of spending, jon lieber and clayton allen of the political risk consultancy eurasia group suggested looking to the policy preferences of the most moderate democrat in the senate and a name you will hear a lot in the coming months: west virginia senator joe manchin. increasing direct payments to $2,000 per person and extending unemployment insurance are among the likeliest priorities, they wrote.
ms. croft said the markets had largely ignored the steps iran had taken to respond to the reinstatement of american economic sanctions by the trump administration. the united states and saudi arabia have said iran was behind naval mines that damaged oil tankers and was behind an aerial attack on key facilities that temporarily cut saudi oil production by more than half. these moves were apparently intended to demonstrate that tehran would make it difficult or impossible for american allies like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to export oil if the trump administration hemmed in iranian exports.

curry, held out of thursday's game with an ankle injury, was removed from the sixers' bench and placed in isolation after being notified of the positive test during the first half, according to two people familiar with the circumstances who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details publicly. on thursday, curry had taken two daily coronavirus tests as required by the n.b.a. 's health and safety protocols — one rapid test and one polymerase chain reaction test. the rapid test came up as negative, allowing curry to be on the bench with a mask, according to one of the people familiar with the situation. the 76ers then received the result of curry's p.c.r. test and took him to an isolated room at barclays arena as play continued. he left the arena separately from the rest of the team. according to the n.b.a. 's protocols, a positive test requires a team to notify any close contacts of the confirmed positive case of their status and appropriate next steps, including retesting or quarantine. a player that has tested positive must isolate for at least 10 days or return two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart before he can take steps to return to play, such as working out by himself when no other players are present. the nets played the grizzlies, as scheduled, on friday night. sopan deb and

arkansas, new mexico and idaho have suspended state jury trials through january, according to the center; tennessee and four other states have suspended them through february or march; and the district of columbia and eight states have suspended them indefinitely, including idaho, where the supreme court called them off in mid-december. paula hannaford-agor, the director of the center for jury studies at the n.c.s.c., said there seemed little prospect of suspensions ending soon. the way things are looking right now, which are frankly awful, ms. hannaford-agor said, my anticipation is that there will be few to no jury trials probably for another two months. much depends on the speed and effectiveness of vaccination programs, she said. the new chief justice of north carolina, paul newby, said wednesday that he had asked gov. roy cooper to speed up vaccination of court personnel. access to justice through the courts is not a luxury — it's a mandate, justice newby said. the inability to conduct jury trials has wreaked havoc with the dockets of many courts, including those of new york city, where only nine criminal jury trials were completed between march and the end of november. what is this going to look like when things start back up and there's a huge backlog? ms. hannaford-agor said. it's going to be a mess.

i coined the word homophobia to mean it was a phobia about homosexuals, dr. weinberg told gregory m. herek, a professor of psychology at the university of california, davis, in 1998. it was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for — home and family. it was a religious fear, and it had led to great brutality, as fear always does.
history will rightly remember today's violence at the capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation, mr. obama wrote. violent clashes between the police and a pro-trump mob underscored a grim reality for mr. biden: he will not only inherit a country wracked by a pandemic and an economic crisis, but also a political fabric that has been ripped apart by mr. trump in ways that have few equals in the nation's history. never before in america's modern history has the peaceful transfer of power devolved into a physical confrontation inside the corridors of power in washington, this time egged on by an incumbent president, who on wednesday morning raged that the election was rigged and vowed we will never concede! unlike mr. biden, mr. trump remained mostly silent for hours, tweeting only that he hoped his supporters would remain peaceful and eventually saying that the national guard would be sent to help the police. moments after mr. biden delivered his remarks, mr. trump posted a one-minute video in which he empathized with the rioters because we had an election that was stolen, but urged them to go home now. we have to have peace. we have to have law and order. but many of his supporters appeared to dismiss the president's tweets and video. protesters waving trump flags descended on the capitol.
staffing agencies say they have seen hiring in the automotive business and financial services. the demand for warehouse and delivery workers also remains strong. one of the biggest trends has been the increase in customer service workers and call center representatives operating from home, ms. glaser of adecco said. those jobs require greater digital literacy than in the past, she said, because individuals must be able to set up their computers and solve problems themselves. there is no tech person sitting down the hallway, she said.
'traitor!' dozens of trump supporters heckle lindsey graham for breaking with the president. senator lindsay graham, republican of south carolina, speaking to reporters on thursday. credit... michael reynolds/epa, via shutterstock jeering supporters of president trump accosted senator lindsey graham of south carolina on friday at ronald reagan national airport in washington, angrily denouncing the republican as a traitor and a liar for voting to formalize president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory. traitor! traitor! one woman could be heard yelling in a pair of videos shared with the new york times. you said you had his back and you didn't. get out of here, another woman shouted at mr. graham, who was once considered mr. trump's closest ally in the senate. you don't represent america. the tense scene vivified the continuing crisis unfolding in the republican party, as lawmakers, their voters and the nation reel from an insurrection by mr. trump's supporters that overtook the capitol this week while congress was meeting to count the electoral votes. mr. graham was far from alone, as elected republicans who rejected mr. trump's attempt to overturn the election faced intense backlash from their own constituents, who have been persuaded by the president's false claims that he won. senator mitt romney, republican of utah, also had a nasty airport confrontation with supporters of mr. trump, while other republicans were accosted outside the capitol by voters from their states who had traveled to washington at the president's urging to protest his election defeat.
but those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. the former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke, originally a george w. bush nominee, spent years imploring congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.
our concern is the additional costs that are starting to pop up in the process, the mayor said on tuesday while unveiling the city's $84.7 billion budget proposal. we put forward a proposal around 421-a, with very simple standards: reduce exposure for taxpayers, and that means city taxpayers, because we have to pay the bill; more affordable housing; and, don't fund luxury housing. it was really simple.

in fairness to trump, the immigration bludgeon was effective once — for two reasons that played out in surprising ways across the 2016 campaign. first, trump-the-candidate's dire warnings about criminals and terrorists crossing the southern border dovetailed with two 2016-specific trends — the spike in violent crime after decades of decline, and the rash of islamic state-inspired attacks on both sides of the atlantic.

the trump supporters had made their way to the capitol at the president's behest, after attending a rally near the white house, where he baselessly claimed the election results were fraudulent. it was only hours into the melee, and after an explosive device was found at the republican national committee headquarters, that mr. trump released a message telling the mob to leave. you have to go home now, he said in a video message filmed at the white house and posted on twitter. we have to have peace. we have to have law and order. we don't want anyone hurt. still, the president ultimately offered encouragement to the mob, noting: we love you. you're very special, and i know how you feel. but many advisers around the president were worried that his message in the video was not forceful enough and that some of his supporters would interpret it as encouragement to continue fighting for him. alyssa farah, who resigned last month from her post as the white house communications director, tweeted a more direct message at the president's supporters. dear maga- i am one of you. before i worked for @realdonaldtrump, i worked for @markmeadows & @jim_jordan & the @freedomcaucus, she said, establishing her conservative bona fides. i marched in the 2010 tea party rallies. i campaigned w/ trump & voted for him. but i need you to hear me: the election was not stolen. we lost. earlier in the day the president had also encouraged his supporters with an alternate message.

the growth of small donor contributions online has lessened the dependence of democratic candidates on the network of washington-based pacs and lobbyist-run fund-raisers. the question now, walter shapiro, a fellow at the brennan center, writes, is whether democrats can withstand the inevitable pressure to adapt to business as usual in washington by resisting the traditional advice to court big-money contributors.
the company cambridge analytica started by running surveys on facebook to get information about people. it later pivoted to be an advertising company, part of our facebook marketing partner program, who other companies could hire to run their ads. their claim to fame was psychographic targeting. this was pure snake oil and we knew it; their ads performed no better than any other marketing partner (and in many cases performed worse). i personally regret letting them stay on the fmp program for that reason alone. however at the time we thought they were just another company trying to find an angle to promote themselves and assumed poor performance would eventually lose them their clients. we had no idea they were shopping an old facebook dataset that they were supposed to have deleted (and certified to us in writing that they had).

a fuller picture of december employment will come friday when the labor department releases its monthly jobs report, and most analysts are expecting minor payroll gains — or even the first net loss since april. as for thursday's report, there was a sharp increase in claims for extended state benefits — payments to the long-term unemployed whose regular benefits have run out. but new claims under the federal pandemic unemployment assistance program fell, most likely reflecting the exhaustion of benefits before congress acted. some fuzziness surrounding the count could be related to the difficulty of seasonally adjusting the numbers over the holidays, said ernie tedeschi, the head of fiscal analysis at evercore isi. the unadjusted number for new state claims was up by 77,000 from the previous week, while the seasonally adjusted number scarcely budged. but longer-term trends, mr. tedeschi noted, are more meaningful than any week-to-week changes.

the city's use of hotels has always drawn criticism, mainly because of the high costs and the inconvenience to families forced to live in small quarters with no cooking facilities and no social services that could help them get out of the shelter system. in late 2015, the city stopped placing families with children in hotels on staten island because of the hardship on students and their parents who had to board buses as early as 5:30 a.m. to get to school on time in other boroughs.
democrats were rushing to begin the expedited proceeding two days after the president rallied his supporters near the white house, urging them to go to the capitol to protest his election defeat, then continuing to stoke their grievances as they stormed the edifice — with mr. pence and the entire congress meeting inside to formalize mr. biden's victory — in a rampage that left an officer and a member of the mob dead. (three others died, including one woman who was crushed in the crowd, and two men who had medical emergencies on the capitol grounds.) the prospect of forcing mr. trump from office in less than two weeks appeared remote given the logistical and political challenges involved, given that a two-thirds majority in the senate would be required. just a day after he voted twice to overturn mr. biden's legitimate victory in key swing states, representative kevin mccarthy of california, the republican leader, urged both parties to lower the temperature and said he would reach out to mr. biden about uniting the country. though he did not defend mr. trump, he argued that seeking to remove him would not help. impeaching the president with just 12 days left in his term will only divide our country more, he said. at least some republicans appeared newly open to the possibility, which could also disqualify mr. trump from holding political office in the future.

instead, the administration appears to be complying with the wishes of the trucking industry, which has called for a new national nitrogen dioxide regulation to override states that could otherwise implement their own, tighter rules. on that front, the e.p.a. rule is likely to open a new battle in mr. trump's long-running war with california over environmental regulations and states' rights. california is already moving ahead with stringent state-level standards on nitrogen dioxide pollution from trucks that could be replicated by other states.

the office investigated the allegations, which were first reported two years ago by the new york times, and determined that since at least 2005, the restaurant had violated state and city human-rights laws by maintaining a hostile and highly sexualized workplace where female employees were subjected to severe and pervasive incidents of unwanted touching and sexual advances by mr. friedman and some guests. when they reported the abuse, the investigation showed, mr. friedman retaliated by firing employees or trying to blackball them in the industry.
the bush fires have created toxic pollution and choking smoke, causing the air quality index in victoria to rise to more than 999 — the worst in the world on thursday. any air quality index over 200 is considered hazardous to health. in sydney heavy smoke has discolored the sky on many days, and the air quality there has at times been among the worst in the world. in canberra, the nation's capital, the air quality rating was over 340, leading some businesses to remain closed on monday. beijing's rating was 170.
what's at stake: if china and the u.s. let tensions escalate and investors pull back, you're looking at enough of a tightening in financial conditions to say that a global recession is a real risk, peter hooper, a former federal reserve official and deutsche bank's chief economist, told bloomberg.
usada also describes the substance, the selective androgen receptor modulator lgd-4033, as having fewer side effects than steroids.
why it matters: afghanistan could rely on american support for years, complicating president trump's efforts to withdraw u.s. troops.
this willingness to experiment was also a hallmark of the deng xiaoping and jiang zemin periods.
emily cochrane, who covers congress for the new york times, likens reporting on economic stimulus legislation to a marathon that doesn't quite end. last week, at least one marathon finished with the latest relief bill's passage and, after some drama, the president's signature. ms. cochrane, who focuses on congressional spending as part of a team of reporters covering capitol hill, discussed what goes into doing her job and the experience of reporting during the coronavirus pandemic. the following interview has been lightly edited.
exactly. iraq becomes a geographic extension of iran and its interests in the region. and by the time isis takes over parts of syria in idlib and parts of iraq in mosul, the iraqi government and even the americans were at wit's end on what to do to battle this growing threat of isis.
the trump administration has also rushed in recent weeks to lock in weak pollution rules.
though more than 50 women have accused mr. cosby, once among america's most beloved entertainers, of drugging and sexually assaulting them, only two were permitted to to tell their stories in a pennsylvania court in the first trial, which ended last summer with a hung jury.
that was applauded by other critics of the drug industry. i think sunshine is an excellent disinfectant, said david mitchell, the founder of a new group, patients for affordable drugs, that seeks to lower drug prices, and does not take funding from industry groups. he was not involved in the study.
mr. pompeo blamed the prior white house administration for fundamental misunderstandings that adversely affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people in egypt and across the region.
you follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice, ms. doggart posted on the facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.'oh no. wait. we were mistaken. it's actually the opposite thing you should be doing!'
the producers did not immediately specify a reason for the shift, but it comes amid several years of debate over the fate of the university's single-gender organizations, and amid a wider cultural reckoning over sexual harassment and the treatment of women in the workplace, including in hollywood.
mr. trump's refusal to acknowledge his defeat also robbed ms. loeffler of what might have been her best argument in what is still a slightly right-leaning state — that she would be a check on the liberal excesses in a government fully controlled by democrats. even before polls closed on tuesday, senior republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of mr. trump's denial. jonathan martin and
the president continued to float the idea of declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass congress to fund the wall.
smith's answers were short and uninformative. he spoke with his forehead furrowed, his expression pained and puzzled, as the commissioners guided him through various episodes of childhood delinquency — stealing bikes, cutting school — until they arrived at the crime he was incarcerated for, the botched attempt at a revenge killing of a rival gang member. smith's crew had been trying to sneak up on the apartment where the man was hiding out, but smith, who said he didn't know much about firearms, had accidentally fired his weapon into the ground, triggering the shootout. brown was hospitalized for 15 months before he died.
in city after city, day after day, we saw peaceful protesters met with brute force. we saw cracked skulls and mass arrests, law enforcement pepper spraying its way through a peaceful demonstration for a presidential photo op, mrs. obama wrote. the response to the mob this week had been considerably more muted, she said, an imbalance that she found painful to grapple with. i hurt for our country, mrs. obama said. and i wish i had all the solutions to make things better. i wish i had the confidence that people who know better will act like it for more than a news cycle or two. read more
and depending on the housing project, preference may be given to those who meet certain criteria, like municipal workers, the homeless or residents of the neighborhood where the development is being built. (the latter, known as community preference, has come under attack for perpetuating racial segregation in some neighborhoods, and in the wake of a growing homeless population, some have also criticized the lottery program for not giving enough preference to the homeless.)
just two months after mr. bush arrived at yale, his father lost a closely watched senate race in texas to the incumbent, ralph yarborough. george w. had flown back to texas for election night and watched as his father choked back his sorrow before a crowd in his concession speech.
i am reminded of the story of the two jews reading their newspapers over a cup of coffee in a late-nineteenth-century viennese cafe. kurt is reading the liberal yiddish-language newspaper and shaking his head from side to side, uttering soft moans of oy vey and vey is meir. shmulie is reading the right-wing, anti-semitic german-language tabloid and smiling. kurt, noticing what shmulie is reading, shouts at his friend, why are you reading that garbage? shmulie responds, when i used to take your newspaper, all i would ever read about was dreyfus being falsely accused, the jews of russia being subjected to pogroms, anti-semitic laws being enacted all over europe, and the grinding poverty of the jews in the holy land. now, ever since i take this paper, i read about how the jews control the banks, the press, the arts; how jews hold all political power behind the scenes; and how we will soon take over the world. wouldn't you rather read such good news than such bad news?
the national climate assessment, america's premier contribution to climate knowledge, stands out for many reasons: hundreds of scientists across the federal government and academia join forces to compile the best insights available on climate change. the results, released just twice a decade or so, shape years of government decisions.
these days when mr. xi speaks, officials from the top of the communist party to the lowest village committees snap to unflinching attention. the pressure on them may grow now that mr. xi has swept away a constitutional term limit on his presidency, strengthening his grip over the country.
the police, saying that the demonstrators violated the law and endangered public safety by entering the highway, either arrested or cited and released nearly 650 protesters. the process took about five hours. most were given misdemeanor charges, but a 19-year-old woman received felony riot charges for shining a laser pointer into the eyes of a police officer.
it is too early to count mr. netanyahu out, as the columnist bret stephens wisely wrote in these pages. if an early election is called, most polls predict that he would win another round. if he is indicted, he might still be able to persuade his coalition partners to wait for a court verdict before forcing him out.
it seemed appropriate that the jobs numbers for the final months of 2020 would be as nasty as the year as a whole was.
at a meeting with ms. pelosi and mr. schumer in december, mr. trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown.
the results in brazil are closely watched by regulators in other countries that are conducting trials for the sinovac vaccine because it had the biggest number of volunteers, at 12,476. turkey announced on dec. 24 that the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.25 percent, but it was based on preliminary results from a small clinical trial. the scientists who ran the trial discussed the results at a news conference, but they did not provide the data online in written form.
and there were many enablers — educated, smart, articulate, often wealthy people who were willing to ignore mr. trump's threat to democracy in the name of economic growth, lower taxes, lighter regulations, or simply access and proximity to power.
some other classmates regard that as a huge exaggeration, but even those who frowned on mr. bush, seeing him as an airhead party boy, tended to think of him as affable and unusually helpful to his friends.
the fabric feels cheap, though. i hate the fabric. i hate the fit. they squeeze my thighs when i pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. they are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. and yet, beginning in september, i have been wearing them at least three times a week.
but moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge, he and his family were stopped by mexican officials and detained.
he was the best-known guy at yale, mr. betts added.
ironically, it's only now that some countries are looking at china as a model. can it be a model?
following are edited excerpts from a conversation with mr. penn:
i don't really remember when i pulled the black everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? or the fall, when i began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while i was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?
nearly 1.1 million international students attended american colleges and universities in 2017. they generated $42.4 billion in export revenue, more than double the amount eight years ago, according to the bureau of economic analysis. (because far fewer americans study abroad, the united states ran a $34.2 billion surplus in education in 2017.) nafsa, a nonprofit group that supports international education, estimates that students from abroad created or sustained more than 455,000 jobs in the united states, almost nine times the number of american coal miners. the value of education is almost double the revenue from america's top agricultural export in 2017, soybeans ($21.6 billion). when other student spending is factored in — food, cars, clothes — education's total export value rivals that of pharmaceuticals ($51 billion) and automobiles ($53 billion). in the public at large, there's little awareness that higher education is one of america's biggest exports, says rajika bhandari, senior adviser for research and strategy at the institute of international education. or that this export drives american competitiveness.
ms. young rose to prominence as an executive with grey advertising, where she began in 1959, standing out as one of the few women and one of the few asian-americans at the firm, which was then a power in its field. with a degree in economics from wellesley, she challenged the conventional wisdom that the best marketing was driven by gut instincts.
i do not know how anyone can be sanguine about iran's disruptive capabilities after that drone/cruise missile attack, ms. croft said. saudi aramco, the national oil company, managed to restore production remarkably quickly, but ms. croft said it was not clear that the company would be able to respond as fast to future attacks.
in another, a man alleged that an officer twice squeezed his genitals during a frisk last year that followed a street stop for jaywalking.
so how did suleimani cultivate that role? how did he make iranians feel that way? where does that story start?
the national security council engaged in reverse engineering under mr. mcmaster as well. but officials said the trend had gotten worse under mr. bolton, in part because he did not trust the national-security bureaucracy and saw no reason to include it in policymaking.
but the capitulation dented mr. netanyahu's image as a master political player.
in an editorial on dec. 27, the post urged mr. trump to stop the insanity and to accept the results of the election. mr. poole joined the sun in 2016. he was previously the managing editor of the the daily mail's u.s. website.
but when mr. krankvich called the joliet diocese, he said church officials referred him to a priest who was providence's new president.
from her perspective, she wasn't networked at all, but she had the dollars, ms. spalthoff said. now she has this crazy network. that's highly effective.
stocks climb to record as wall street keeps its focus on democrats' spending plans. stocks rose to another record on thursday, a day after chaos erupted in washington when a pro-trump mob overran the capitol building, as investors focused instead on chances for increased federal spending by a biden administration and a congress under unified democratic control. the s&p 500 climbed by 1.5 percent, adding to a string of records since president-elect joseph r. biden jr. won the presidential election. the s&p is up nearly 13 percent since that nov. 3 vote, but only now, after democrats won two senate seats in runoff elections in georgia on tuesday, do investors feel they have a complete view of the implications of the political season. across stock, bond and commodities markets, they are betting that democratic control will soon translate into another major round of federal stimulus spending, raising the chances of a much stronger economic recovery over the coming months — a view that helped traders look past violence in washington and to the impact of a government unified under democratic leadership, analysts said. the political cycle of 2020 has ended. we've finished the senatorial elections. we've finished the house elections. we've finished the presidential elections, said randy watts, chief investment officer for o'neil global advisors, a financial advisory firm. so i think the market is happy, as many investors are, to finally get that behind them and be able to focus on policy and economics and corporate profits.
disturbingly, it's a bit of a trick question. america doesn't really have a grand strategy. what we do have, a patchwork of doctrines left over from the cold war, fails to match our abilities, our national goals and the changing shape of global threats and opportunities.
they were right to be there, he added. the problem is it was a tough fight.
i say we may be entering this golden age; there are no guarantees. many jews believe that the end is near, because increasing rates of assimilation and intermarriage are propelling us toward a demographic armageddon. a recent apocalyptic article in a jewish journal concluded that kaddish time is fast approaching for the american jewish community. (kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) but reports of the death of judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about jewish survival. if we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then jewish life in america may indeed be doomed.
ms. ragan, who trains and handles personnel matters at the restaurants and cafes, says she talks to her staff about negotiating benefits every day. she wants foodshed to be a place where those in their 20s and 30s think about making their lives here.

jerome powell, the federal reserve chairman, said the central bank would evaluate the health of the economy before any further interest rate increases, using the word patience four times in his remarks. financial markets have shown signs of anxiety about the economic outlook, but mr. powell said 2018 was a very good year for the economy. the fed, he said, saw signs of continued momentum.
new delhi — prime minister narendra modi led his party to a landslide victory in india's largest state on saturday, consolidating his power and putting him in a strong position to win re-election in 2019.
neither his good intentions nor his clean prison record were enough to get him a parole date, however. i'm getting denied for what we consider as being little things — you know, insight, you're not showing remorse, he told me over the phone shortly before his ninth parole hearing. those little things, of course, were the very things the parole board considered paramount, but a lot of the board's preoccupations seemed illogical to smith. it had taken him a long time to understand why the authorities considered his group of associates to be a gang — a word he associated with large criminal organizations — or why he would be guilty of murder when the victim was shot by someone else. he said he thought about terry brown's murder every day, but it was hard to access his feelings sometimes, particularly in the hearing room. each time he went before the board, smith ended up tongue-tied and inarticulate. but was that indicative of the future danger he posed to the public?
cyrillic was part of russia's colonial project and many see the latin alphabet as an anti-imperial move, said dossym satpayev, a prominent kazakh political commentator.
production ramp-ups are in progress, he noted, but might not alter the market for a few months. ellume's test, for example, while it will be sold over the counter in a few weeks, will still be available in only very limited quantities. experts have repeatedly cautioned that rapid tests are not as accurate or consistent as tests that route people's samples through a laboratory, where they are typically processed with a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or p.c.r. rapid tests, which can run from start to finish in a matter of minutes, may also falter more often when used on people without symptoms. even so, they are often used — as a way to frequently screen some populations like nursing home residents and schoolchildren. but rapid tests typically have cost and convenience on their side — benefits that dr. giroir repeatedly underscored in a call with reporters. he noted the slow and bumpy rollout of testing in the united states, where speedy tests results are still a relative rarity. dr. giroir said it was not yet obvious whether widespread at-home testing would be successful. susan butler-wu, a clinical microbiologist at the university of southern california's keck school of medicine, said at-home testing might streamline the testing process. people who feel sick could test themselves and determine whether they need to isolate or seek treatment in a matter of minutes. but outsourcing testing to the general public also carries risks.
on wednesday, however, mr. johnson went to parliament with some of his toughest measures yet, and the chamber's unruly backbenches were quiet. so dire is the public health crisis now confronting britain that it has temporarily stilled the political debates that have raged since the virus first emerged in the country 11 months ago.
anyway, the puzzle. mr. dipietro uses the ides revealer at 38a to give us a hint to his theme set in the down entries, all beginning with the homophonic contraction i'd. for example, at 20d, we have the clue 'yes, how nice of you to offer' and the answer is i'd be honored. collectively, the four theme entries make up the ides.
congress runs sort of on a schedule. there are some things that are sacrosanct to congress, and one of those things is fly-in days on mondays. they come in, and first votes aren't until around 5, and they leave by about 1:45 on thursdays. there are leadership lunches and caucus calls on tuesdays that sort of set the tone for the rest of the week. and then you have votes that you kind of plan your day around.
manager terry collins said cespedes would have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on friday. anytime you're talking about hamstrings, it's a concern, he said.
china conducted its first nuclear test in 1964, and has developed a stable of nuclear missiles. but it is not a big stable, compared with the thousands of warheads held by the united states and russia.
mr. bush's tension with what he sees as an arrogant eastern elite, and his perception of himself as outside it, seem to have arisen initially from the clash of generations that occurred while he was at yale. mr. bush entirely subscribed to his parents' and grandparents' view of absolute and immutable values, of privilege balanced by duty. he was proud when his grandfather, crusty old senator prescott bush of connecticut, denounced his party for considering nelson rockefeller for the presidential nomination in 1964, after mr. rockefeller had divorced his wife and remarried.
background: coca-cola tried similar tactics in the u.s. several years ago, saying that exercise, not dieting, was the solution to the obesity crisis. after an outcry from public health advocates, it stopped those efforts.
its worldwide clinical development was undertaken by an american company, and it is manufactured in both belgium and the united states. that we have this vaccine is both a scientific tour de force and an unprecedented example of international collaboration.
an email that the retired engineer ian mitchell sent to friends on new year's day from the small northern victoria community of gipsy point speaks for countless australians at this moment of catastrophe:
as most republicans and all democrats rejected the attempt, senator mike lee, republican of utah, forcefully turned back the plot, registering his vote as hell no. earlier in the evening, lawmakers rejected an attempt to overturn the arizona electoral slate. the house blocked the attempt with a 303-to-121 vote while the senate offered a sharper rebuke with a 93-to-6 vote. after debating the merits of subverting the majority of arizona voters, lawmakers sped through the certification for several states after at least four republican lawmakers, including senator kelly loeffler of georgia, said they had changed their minds and would vote to uphold the electoral college results after having previously said that they would object to them. those voting against the results of the election in arizona were: mr. hawley, mr. cruz, mr. tuberville, ms. hyde-smith, mr. marshall and john kennedy of louisiana. the move by ms. loeffler, who lost a special election in georgia and failed to retain her senate seat, amounted to one of her last acts in the upper chamber, and she announced her reversal during remarks on the senate floor after the debate resumed late wednesday. breaking: sen. kelly loeffler: when i arrived in washington this morning, i fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes. however, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and i cannot now, in good conscience, object.
it's really messy, said alice hill, who oversaw resilience planning on the national security council during the obama administration and is now a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations. you can upset a lot of voters.
for the year that ended in october, 22 of every 10,000 flights were diverted on average, according to the department of transportation. but many of those flights did not require an overnight stay at the unexpected stop because the planes eventually took off again and got where they were going. american said six in 10,000 diverted during the evening in 2017 and spent the night in that spot; southwest did not provide a figure. meanwhile, there are not minors flying without parents on every flight.
atlanta — the day after georgia elected a black descendant of sharecroppers and a young jewish filmmaker to be u.s. senators, underscoring the rising political power of racial and religious minorities, the forces of white grievance politics struck back.

there are those who would want you to believe that organizing in the tech industry is completely impossible, sara steffens, c.w.a.'s secretary-treasurer, said of the new google union. if you don't have unions in the tech industry, what does that mean for our country? that's one reason, from c.w.a.'s point of view, that we see this as a priority.

unemployment rate by ella koeze · seasonally adjusted · source: bureau of labor statistics hiring has slowed every month since june, and the economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020 as a whole, the first calendar-year decline since 2010 and the worst on a percentage basis since the aftermath of world war ii. congress last month passed a $900 billion relief package that will provide temporary support to households and businesses and could give a boost to the broader economy. and in the longer run, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines should allow the return of activity that has been suppressed by the pandemic. but the vaccine and the aid came too late to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. we did have a pullback in the economy, said michelle meyer, head of u.s. economics at bank of america. if stimulus was passed earlier, maybe that could have been avoided.
democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing. they do not support mr. trump's border wall.
chaos in washington undercuts stock market rally, but s&p 500 still ends with a small gain. a rally in financial markets faded quickly on wednesday afternoon as protests in washington turned violent and the capitol building was placed on lockdown.
while the move could give president trump a nominal environmental achievement for the 2020 campaign, public health experts say the truck regulations are not as out of line with administration policy as they would appear. the emerging rule will quite likely limit nitrogen dioxide pollution more than current standards, they say, but still fall far short of what is necessary to significantly prevent respiratory illness and even premature deaths.
culminating these past few weeks of violence in iraq —
if policies like paid parental leave and subsidized child care enabled more mothers to work, the united states could add five million prime-age workers to its labor force, according to a new economic letter from the federal reserve bank of san francisco. spending on child care makes the biggest difference in female employment, earnings and fertility, found a recent paper.
he preferred to talk about other matters: his plans for the future with his grown daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter and goddaughter; his ignorance of the basics of the modern world after so long in prison (he didn't know, he confessed, how to use a microwave oven); the old friends who were law-abiding citizens now. the story he had to tell was straightforward: he'd been a hardheaded young man once, but he had been a model inmate for more than two decades. now he hoped to return to his old neighborhoods and talk to youngsters who were as hardheaded as he used to be. i want to go back out there, he said. i want to help bring my community back up.
tuesday's victory was perhaps more about pragmatism than principles. just over 80 percent of the men of the honourable company of edinburgh, which runs muirfield, determined that it is better to have to share membership privileges with the occasional woman than to be excluded from hosting a british open.
when you announce your decision, tie it to a concrete final date. you can choose to be flexible if requested, but anchor the discussion to a specific time frame; don't start out with something vague or squishy.
by contrast, mr. wang had spent most of his career as a hong kong specialist before he was named to run the office in hong kong in 2017.
if i were mark zuckerberg, i might actually relish seeing my users agonize over the question of to delete or not to delete. every moment they are talking about whether to walk away from the content they've created and the network they've built is a moment they aren't talking about facebook executives being brought to justice and the company brought under proper regulation.
iran expanded its stockpile of low enriched uranium beyond the nuclear deal's limit of 300 kilograms, conducted research that could enable it to build more advanced centrifuges, exceeded the previous limits on the level of enrichment, and started operating centrifuges in a hardened bunker near the city of qom — but it stopped short of exiting the agreement entirely.
the idea that it's o.k. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons — it's not a fair fight, lady kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a facebook policy executive. it's little timmy in his bedroom versus mark zuckerberg in his valley.
for many years i would have said no, but many countries are struggling with how to deal with pressing basic problems like maintaining internal security, building physical infrastructure and providing jobs. these are the basis of populist movements around the world. china is a point of orientation. it can't be duplicated because these other countries don't have a communist party with the special history and features of china's. but in terms of considering illiberal, state-directed solutions, china is often cited as an example of how an authoritarian government can deal with things differently. china's experience is thus a permanent question mark for the world when they ask if the western model is the best.
last week megan fairchild, a new york city ballet principal, posted a photograph on instagram of herself and joaquin de luz with patricia mcbride. what a pleasure and honor to work with this bright spirit on a ballet that is dear to our hearts!!!!, she wrote. thanks pattie for all your nuggets of wisdom! so wonderful to hear what she did in the role, and what mr. b. asked her to do. we will cherish these last two days forever!!!! one of the hashtags is #baiserdelafee.
now the rest of the world understands that trump could actually make a comeback in 2024, so that is a shadow that he will cast over american politics, mr. wright said.
stoking demand is all about certification, labeling and marketing. the senate is considering proposals calling for disclosure of pharmaceutical production and sourcing. that's a great step, and it should be extended to other industries.
reaffirming that much progress remains to be made … in moving the nation toward a more integrated society, justice anthony kennedy wrote in a 5-4 supreme court decision in 2015 that it was appropriate for the fair housing act of 1968 to let discrimination be measured by its disparate impact on minorities even if there was not proof of intentional discrimination.
i think that's absolutely right. and i think, you know, we have to remember iran has been an island of stability in a region ablaze with terrorism and car bombs and beheadings and kidnappings and women being sold by isis. and iranians have, like, watched the whole region unravel around them — refugees and displacement — for the past 20 years. and by and large, they credit general suleimani for that. they say that they trusted him and respected him for protecting iran, for keeping iran safe. and i think the outpouring of emotion we see is related to that sentiment.
and even though mr. pence said numbers would not be part of the weekend discussions, the secretary of the department of homeland security, kirstjen nielsen, on sunday provided democrats with a written statement outlining why the administration needed $5.7 billion for a barrier along the southern border.
mr. biden's immigration proposals stand in stark contrast to policies imposed by president trump. in a recent interview with the washington examiner, a conservative outlet, ken cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, estimated that up to 140,000 immigrants could cross the border each month under mr. biden. i mean, you saw the 'trump effect' when president trump came into office, mr. cuccinelli said. you're going to see the 'biden effect' as well. and it's going to be the opposite. and they're feeding that, and it's really bad for america. it's going to be a humanitarian problem, particularly in the midst of covid.
like ms. warren, candidates often announce their campaigns at the end or the beginning of a quarter, and the choice is strategic: if you announce at the end of a quarter and raise a lot of money very quickly, you can report an impressive total right away and help cement yourself as a serious candidate. if you announce near the beginning of a quarter, you give yourself almost three months to build a respectable total before you have to disclose it.
berlin — seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, sebastian kurz, austria's former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive greens.
the report comes months after mayor bill de blasio unveiled his plan to open new homeless shelters to end the use of hotels. as the homeless population has ballooned to about 77,000 people, the city has become more dependent than ever on hotels, spending upward of $575,000 a day on rooms to accommodate about 7,500 homeless people.

jan. 5, 2021, 10:36 p.m. et jan. 5, 2021, 10:36 p.m. et plenty of votes remain, but the democrats are now the favorites. elections workers at the fulton county georgia elections warehouse in atlanta. credit... ben gray/associated press the democrats now appear favored to prevail in both of their senate races in georgia, and therefore are the favorites to take control of the u.s. senate. the two republican candidates hold small leads in the vote count, and still have a chance to hold onto those advantages, but most of the remaining vote is in democratic-leaning areas. the largest block of remaining ballots is the in-person vote in dekalb county, a heavily democratic area that includes part of atlanta. over all, the two democratic candidates are favored to win the remaining vote by around nine percentage points, according to upshot estimates. democrats benefited from strong turnout among black voters, who are on track to represent a much larger share of the electorate than they did in the general election, based on the turnout by precinct and early voting data. with 5 percent of the vote left to count, the rev. raphael warnock's projected lead over senator kelly loeffler is larger than jon ossoff's projected lead over david perdue. it's hard to say when either race will be called. the ossoff-perdue call might have to wait until late absentee and provisional ballots are counted. read more

what the memo actually reflected, though, was an effort to spare overburdened emergency rooms from having to spend time and resources on patients who were already beyond their help. and rather than a dire last resort, it was actually a relatively small change from the county's previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from taking most patients whose heartbeats could not be restored where they were found to the hospital.
the latest: news organizations have called one of georgia's two senate races for the rev. raphael warnock, beating out the republican incumbent and former wall streeter, kelly loeffler. (she has not conceded.) and with nearly all of the votes counted, jon ossoff, the democratic challenger to the republican incumbent, david perdue, is ahead by more than 16,000 votes. (the margin is still within the limits of allowing for a recount and many media outlets have not yet called the race.)

the country's lockdown in late march reduced the number and diversity of new lineages, but the larger and more established ones continued to spread; some 75 percent of sampled viruses belong to the top 20 percent of the lineages, ranked by size. the degree to which the surviving lineages contributed to the u.k.'s ongoing second epidemic is under investigation, the authors noted.

washington — things were on a clear course as far as president trump's re-election campaign was concerned. the impeachment proceedings unfolding on capitol hill had proved to be a boost for volunteer recruitment and small-dollar donations. the year ended with a blockbuster jobs report and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent, its lowest level since 1969.

jewish home is in trouble for a somewhat similar reason. its forebears, the mizrahi and national religious parties, emerged when the state was founded as the political home for religious zionists, a relatively powerless minority at the time. this minority needed a party to protect its interests, to make sure its religious schools were funded, to represent its ideology. but today, this group no longer feels that it is a fragile minority. its voters are a part of the jewish-israeli mainstream and they have representatives in many parties.

lvmh completes its acquisition of tiffany, and an executive shake-up follows. the tiffany-lvmh saga has finally come to a well-polished, multifaceted end. lvmh, the french conglomerate, completed its acquisition of the american jewelry brand on thursday, and it was out with the old and in with the new — executives, anyway. the fresh slate of power players comes with a pedigree steeped in lvmh tradition, and is sure to set off a new round of speculation over the future leadership of the world's largest luxury group. after a brief transition period, gone will be reed krakoff, tiffany's chief artistic officer and former new york fashion week designer, who tried to update the brand the blue box built with lady gaga as a celebrity face and ironic $1,000 silver tin cans. also leaving will be daniella vitale, the chief brand officer, who joined from barney's after that retailer went bankrupt. in their place comes alexandre arnault, the 28-year-old second son of bernard arnault, lvmh's chairman and chief executive. the younger mr. arnault has been named executive vice president, product and communications. it's the next step in the ascension of alexandre arnault within the family business. he was previously head of rimowa, the lvmh-owned german luggage brand, and was also the only lvmh family member to accompany his father to the opening of a new louis vuitton factory in texas where president trump did the ribbon-cutting honors.

the political rethinking about the deficit — especially in times of economic weakness — is a stark change from earlier eras. in the 1990s, president bill clinton highlighted his success in cutting the deficit and creating a budget surplus as a political achievement for democrats. concerns about excessive federal spending and the national debt also helped fuel the ascent of the tea party in the late 2000s, giving rise to a new breed of republican who succeeded in ushering in austere spending caps that continued to bedevil lawmakers. but after 2014, republicans have joined democrats in waiving those caps, and a bipartisan, bicameral deal struck in 2019 ensures their expiration this year.

i think that they miscalculated the level of admiration, perhaps, or nationalistic sentiment that we've seen pouring out of iran. i think the white house probably thought that it was taking out a military commander, that it may not be very popular with ordinary iranians, that there's been a lot of discontent in november against the government, and maybe iranians would support this decision. for sure, we have voices in iran, outside and inside iran, among iranians, who think that taking mr. suleimani out is justified, and they didn't like him, but what we've seen is that the u.s. has effectively turned general suleimani into a martyr.

why is this book different from other books about the jewish future? because its author does not have a religious or political agenda. this book is not a commercial for any particular brand of judaism or zionism. it does not begin with a priori assumptions about god, the survival of the jewish people, the superiority of orthodox, conservative, reform, or reconstructionist judaism, or the essential conservativism or liberalism of judaism. i am neither a rabbi, a jewish fund-raiser, a member of a jewish studies faculty, an officer of any jewish organization, nor an advocate for any particular israeli party. though i am essentially a secular jew, i do belong to orthodox, conservative, reform, and reconstructionist congregations. most of my family members are modern orthodox, and a few are ultra-orthodox. some are completely secular. i have generally positive feelings about all jewish denominations, as i do about the numerous jewish political, educational, and philanthropic organizations to which i belong and contribute. i have no personal stake in any particular solution to the problem of jewish survival. i just want american jewish life to move from strength to strength. i love my judaism and i feel passionately about its survival, but i do not believe in survival merely for survival's sake. judaism should not be seen as a patient about to die a natural death, who is kept alive artificially on a respirator for as long as possible without regard to the quality of life.
this is a good example of why workplace fund-raising plans — to buy a present, pay for a party, etc. — ought to be handled more thoughtfully than they usually are. even when a gift will be presented as coming from everyone, a better method for actually collecting the cash is to stick with a system that's both voluntary and anonymous: passing around a manila envelope, for instance, and asking for some suggested (but not compulsory or minimum) amount. otherwise, it's almost guaranteed that some will feel pressured, or even bullied, into contributing more than they want to.
still, officials offered scant details and only general explanations for why these reported threats were any different from the rocket attacks, roadside bombings and other assaults carried out by general suleimani's quds force of the islamic revolutionary guards corps over the years. size, scale and scope, general milley said without elaboration.
it's also making them economically freer. medical debt has long been one of the biggest drags on americans' finances. but gaining health insurance through the a.c.a.'s medicaid expansion, for example, saved enrollees money on their health care. they then used that money to pay down debts.

kayleigh mcenany, the white house press secretary, said on thursday the trump administration condemned the violence at the u.s. capitol by trump supporters on wednesday and called for their prosecution. credit credit... pete marovich for the new york times kayleigh mcenany, the white house press secretary, read a statement to reporters on thursday on behalf of the entire white house condemning the violence by trump supporters at the capitol complex a day earlier in the strongest possible terms. those who violently besieged our capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for, she said, though she made no mention of president trump or his speech that set the violence in motion. the president's silence on the violent mob stretched to nearly 24 hours as ms. mcenany spoke for two minutes, then immediately left the white house's press briefing room without questions from reporters. she called for full prosecution of those who breached the capitol. what we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate first amendment rights of trump supporters who had gathered by the national mall to protest the results of the election, which mr. trump has repeatedly declared was stolen from him.
representative val demings of florida, a former police chief who was a contender to be joseph r. biden jr.'s running mate, told the associated press it was painfully obvious that capitol police were not prepared for today. and representative zoe lofgren, the chair of the house administration committee, said she and her panel would work with house and senate leaders to review the police response. the breech at the u.s. capitol, she said, raises grave security concerns. meanwhile, attorneys general from states across the country also made clear that anyone who had traveled to washington to commit crimes would be prosecuted when they returned home. this is despicable, a travesty, said g. zachary terwilliger, the u.s. attorney for the eastern district of virginia. the darkest day since 9/11.

but there is more--much more--to jewish identity than collective self-defense. there is something important that is worth defending. after all, until anti-semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted jews generally had the option of conversion. unlike hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the crusaders, the inquisitors, martin luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between jews who converted to christianity and jews who did not. indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the jews, by whatever methods it took.
roosevelt also invented the white house conference, giving himself yet another way to act without congress. in 1908 he hosted a conference of governors, focused on conservation, and nearly every governor present went home and formed a state conservation commission. the experience was a victory for conservation and public health, and it offered a model for federal-state collaboration on matters affecting the well-being of all americans.

the result was to embolden the iranians to hit harder. instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the iranians reached until they overreached. on wednesday, khamenei taunted trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. the supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. that is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. rashness often springs from wounded pride.

but the labor party is chained to its historical role as the party of a patriotic, nontraditional israelism. it is the party formed by a generation of pioneers who cast aside traditional jewish practice and aimed to create a new jew, a jew whose connection to a jewish past and whose tendency to perform jewish practice is relatively weak. today, this population is small in number and seems to be shrinking. but labor continues to cater to it, and to some of the dwindling pool of people who still have hope for a peace process. this still allows for political survival (our study identified a group of about 15 percent of israelis who score high on israeli patriotism and low on jewish tradition) but it isn't enough to win an election.

mexican reporters who have covered the united states closely watched in astonishment as their neighbor's capital city descended into chaos. i'm amazed at the lack of preparedness of the capitol police and d.c. police, said carlos puig, a mexican television host and newspaper columnist. i guess the u.s. institutions never thought this would happen to them. in russia, the violence fit neatly into the kremlin's propaganda narrative of a crumbling american democracy. russia's state-controlled news channel, rossiya-24, broadcast the chaos at the capitol as part of a split screen, with one side showing happy orthodox christmas festivities in russia, the other the mayhem in washington. in israel, former prime minister ehud barak alluded to president trump's angry speechmaking in recent days as an open attempt at incitement. a shaky coup attempt on capitol hill. lots of incitement by a defeated president who lost his temper, mr. barak wrote on twitter. the lesson is clear: when those who are in charge are allowed to go wild, and those who had to act are paralyzed by fear — even the impossible can happen. the government of venezuela, a frequent target of criticism from the trump administration, issued a statement on twitter that condemned political polarization in the united states and expressed hopes that the american people will finally be able to open a path toward stability and social justice. melissa eddy, aurelien breeden, natalie kitroeff, oscar lopez , anton troianovski, david m. halbfinger, isabel kershner and

mr. huntsman, a former republican governor of utah, served as former president barack obama's ambassador to china from 2009 to 2011. experts said he will need his political dexterity to navigate moscow at a time when mr. trump has called for better ties even as russia's role in the 2016 presidential election remains under intense scrutiny.
if a second dose of the vaccine a patient originally received isn't available, or if the manufacturer of the first shot isn't known, health officials said, another vaccine may be used for the second shot. but it is far from certain that the vaccines are so interchangeable, several researchers warned. viewed as cavalier departures from scientifically backed guidance, experts said, these decisions could further erode public trust in vaccines at a time when deployment is crucial and a new and potentially more transmissible variant of the coronavirus continues to ricochet around the globe. even the appearance of tinkering has negatives, in terms of people having trust in the process, said natalie dean, a biostatistician at the university of florida. you can have a highly efficacious vaccine, but if you can't get it to people, then it's not going to give that protection. the idea of delaying the second dose appears to have gained little traction in the upper echelons of the u.s. government. in a news conference on wednesday, moncef slaoui, the scientific adviser for operation warp speed — the federal effort to accelerate vaccine development and distribution — expressed skepticism about the idea. it's very important, i think, to use the vaccine based on how you have studied it, dr. slaoui said. for me, the biggest concern if we were to extend the time period between the first and second dose, is what happens to persistence of protection.
oxford, miss. — the toddler had no time for this white man in a fine dark suit. robert kennedy may have been a former attorney general and the brother of a slain president, but annie white's son was focused on the cornbread crumbs scattered on the floor of his dilapidated home in cleveland, miss.

although mr. trump characterized his immigration proposal as a down-the-middle compromise, his speech further alienated him from the bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to negotiate a deal. rather than act as a catalyst for cooperation, it seemed to only deepen the divide. and it underlined the political ramifications of the nativist language that the president used in the 2016 campaign and during his first year in office.

christopher c. miller, the acting defense secretary, wrote in a statement on thursday that he supported a peaceful transition of power to president-elect biden on jan. 20. yesterday's violence at the capitol was reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the united states constitution. education secretary betsy devos resigned on thursday night. she condemned the violence in the immediate aftermath on wednesday, writing that an angry mob cannot be allowed to attack our capitol. the peaceful transfer of power is what separates american representative democracy from banana republics. the work of the people must go on. transportation secretary elaine chao resigned on thursday. she was the first cabinet official to join a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the trump presidency. our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the capitol building following a rally he addressed, ms. chao wrote in a letter posted on twitter. it has deeply troubled me in a way that i simply cannot set aside. chad f. wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, denounced the president's supporters who participated in the riot and called on mr. trump to more forcefully condemn them. what transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening, mr. wolf wrote in a statement posted on twitter. we now see some supporters of the president using violence as a means to achieve political ends.

in 1988 i traveled to iran for the funerals of those 290 civilians. their bodies had been fished from the water of the persian gulf and brought home for burial. my editor called me as i left for tehran, asking me to consider the possibility that iran shot down the plane itself, since she thought it odd that the recovered bodies were unclothed. did they put naked corpses in that plane before they shot it down? she asked.

the incoming administration has already sent the message that it will be much more welcoming to immigrants — and not only those seeking to enter the united states, but also those who are already here. the administration has a long list of promises to fulfill in its first 100 days, from legalizing america's approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants and protecting dreamers to granting temporary protected status to the hundreds of thousands of venezuelans living in the united states who escaped nicolás maduro's regime.
the alternative? iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like hezbollah for political deniability. it could try to take hostages at the american embassy in baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in tehran in 1979. it could use its influence in iraq to demand the expulsion of u.s. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as mark dubowitz of the foundation for defense of democracies observes. and it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.

humility believes there is such a thing as collective wisdom and that we're better off if we have within our orbit people who see the world somewhat differently than we do. as iron sharpens iron, the book of proverbs says, so one person sharpens another. but this requires us to actually engage with, and carefully listen to, people who understand things in ways dissimilar to how we do. it means we have to venture out of our philosophical and theological cul-de-sacs from time to time. it's worth the effort.

pfizer says its vaccine works against one of the key mutations in the variants found in britain and south africa. banner health workers prepare doses of the pfizer-biontech coronavirus vaccine in phoenix on monday. credit... adriana zehbrauskas for the new york times pfizer and biontech announced on friday that their vaccine is effective against one of the mutations present in the new contagious variants identified in britain and south africa. the study was posted online thursday night on the web site biorxiv. it has not yet gone through formal scientific review. independent experts said the findings are good news, but cautioned that each of the variants has several other potentially dangerous mutations that have not yet been investigated. so it's possible that one of those mutations affects how well the vaccine works. it's the first step in the right direction, said dr. john brooks, the chief medical officer for the centers for disease control covid-19 emergency response. i'm hoping that the additional work that comes out in the future will fall in line with that finding. the new variant, known as b.1.1.7, first raised concern in december, when british researchers realized that it was rapidly becoming more common among people with covid-19. since then, it has turned up in 45 countries. subsequent research has confirmed that it has the capacity to spread more easily from person to person.
energy secretary dan brouillette condemned what he called a tragic event in our nation's capitol. politically-motivated violence, regardless of ideology or cause, must always be condemned in the strongest possible terms, he wrote on twitter. no american should excuse wanton disregard for one of our nation's most sacred institutions. health secretary alex m. azar ii wrote on twitter that people must immediately and peacefully disperse. i am disgusted by the attack on the capitol we witnessed today. physical violence and the desecration of this hallowed symbol of our democracy must end. housing secretary ben carson also posted on twitter calling for an end to the violence. violence is never an appropriate response regardless of legitimate concerns. please remember: if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. interior secretary david bernhardt condemned the violence and praised the actions of the u.s. park police, an agency in his department, on twitter on wednesday. today's violence and lawlessness at the u.s. capitol cannot and will not be tolerated. thank you u.s. park police for always fulfilling your selfless duties to safeguard lives and protect our symbols of democracy. labor secretary eugene scalia on wednesday called the attack a low point in the history of our democracy. we must immediately rise above this.
the increases closely follow growing prosperity in china that began in the 1980s as beijing embraced market economics after decades of isolation. in 1978, coca-cola was among the first companies allowed into the country, and ilsi arrived soon afterward. seeking to identify influential scientists it could work with, the group found a partner in chen chunming, a leading nutritionist who was the founding president of the chinese academy of preventive medicine, the forerunner of china's c.d.c.

both had traveled outside of the state, he said, one to ireland and the other to new york. genetic sequencing showed the cases are unrelated. pennsylvania also reported that its case was because of international exposure. last month, britain became the first country to identify the new variant, which is now surging there and burdening its hospitals with new cases. now, the variant has been identified in at least 33 countries, including britain. dr. hans kluge, the world health organization's regional director for europe, called the spread of the variant across the continent an alarming situation. without increased control to slow its spread, there will be an increased impact on already stressed and pressurized health facilities, dr. kluge said at a briefing on thursday, warning that the variant may, over time, replace other circulating lineages as it has in britain. dr. kluge urged countries to continue to investigate transmission, increase genetic sequencing and to share data.

in chapters 5, 6, and 7, i explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. to those who are sure that return to religion is judaism's only salvation, i say, get as many to return as you can. maybe you are right. but we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. maybe not enough jews will become religious. maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. maybe there is a strand of judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. after all, the yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the jewish enlightenment (haskalah) and the second world war was an authentic jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. political zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of judaism. today's influential american jewish community is largely secular.
and so i leave others to fulminate over issues and ironies in woody allen's review of edward sorel's book, mary astor's purple diary (jan. 1), and wish only to mark it as the last piece of comedy writing the times will probably ever publish that is so rooted in that sophisticated and ostentatious style of wordplay of which kaufman — a subject of the review — was himself a co-founder. boudoir mechanic, the standard tribal hooter and a character whose ancestors were slaves to pharaoh, if you get my meaning, indeed. allen's piece reminds us that humor changes even within our lifetimes.

the arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, sellian, and priya rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. grace nakamura, an adjudicator for the immigration and refugee board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, kumi. the latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. it's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: bala vilifies the canadian border services agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, stephen harper, and sings the praises of the canadian tamil congress, which appears here as the tamil alliance.
treasury secretary steven mnuchin will remain in his post and carry out his responsibilities until the inauguration, according to a person familiar with his thinking. mr. mnuchin, who was traveling in israel on thursday, condemned the violence but made no mention of the president. these actions are unacceptable and must stop, he said.

to understand the potential ramifications of obama-trump voters in 2020, it's worth understanding how they voted in 2018. among those who voted, three-quarters stuck with the republican party. but democrats did win back about one-fifth of the obama-trump group in 2018, which would amount to a net swing of about 1.5 million votes. while the idiosyncratic governing style of mr. trump may have been one key factor in bringing obama-trump voters back into the democratic fold, it wasn't the only reason. it's true that most obama-trump voters who stuck with the republican party in 2018 strongly approved of the job mr. trump was doing as president, but interestingly even half of those who flipped back to the democratic side at least somewhat approved of mr. trump. democrats won back a significant share of obama-trump voters not because those voters disliked mr. trump, but in spite of the fact that many actually approved of him.
in other words, increasing inequality undermines support for a progressive agenda — the agenda most likely to improve the life chances and conditions of the least well off.

a few years ago, when i was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that i'd missed. i'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, i was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. so it's not surprising that i hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.

but if republicans do not ultimately turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on mr. trump for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the state's election process. for republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that mr. trump's effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself cannot be trusted. charles s. bullock iii, a professor of political science at the university of georgia, said mr. trump's phone call saturday pressuring georgia's secretary of state to overturn the presidential election results there could also turn some of the president's former supporters against the republican candidates. they may say, 'this has gone too far. i can't vote against trump, but i can vote against his surrogates,' mr. bullock said in an interview on monday. read more

one trap i sometimes see people falling into is to dismiss all feedback when they can invalidate one part of it. i see that with personal feedback and i see it happening with media coverage. the press often gets so many details wrong it can be hard to trust the veracity of their conclusions. dismissing the whole because of flaws in parts is a mistake. the media has limited information to work with (by our own design!) and they sometimes get it entirely wrong but there is almost always some critical issue that motivated them to write which we need to understand.
but the problem for trump is that presidents have to deal with changing circumstances and cope with unexpected crises, not just fulminate in the same style regardless of the context. and the world of 2019 looks different than the world in which he campaigned. the crime rate didn't keep rising, the pace of terror attacks hasn't quickened, and fate has given him an immigration crisis that's substantially different than the crisis of murderers and terror plotters that he invoked in his campaign rhetoric — a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of families and children, in which the problem isn't the people that we can't catch crossing the borders but the people who surrender willingly, hoping to exploit our overstrained asylum system and disappear with their kids into the american interior.

re florida's 1.5 million missing voters (editorial, jan. 3):
criminal justice reform continues to adhere to a false binary of who is worthy versus unworthy. as your editorial mentions, criminal disenfranchisement was adopted to uphold white supremacy. in order for democracy to function, elected officials must be accountable to everyone they represent, which only universal suffrage can ensure. it's time for florida's voters to step up and restore the most fundamental constitutional right to all of their neighbors.

josh hawley faces blowback for role in spurious challenge of election results. fellow republicans in the senate have lined up to blame senator josh hawley, center, of missouri, for the riot at the capitol on wednesday. credit... anna moneymaker for the new york times the day after josh hawley became the first republican senator to say he would indulge president trump's demand that lawmakers try to overturn the election, a reporter asked if he thought the gambit would make him unpopular with his colleagues. more than i already am? he retorted. his insistence on pressing the challenge after a violent mob egged on by mr. trump stormed the capitol to protest president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory, endangering the entire congress and the vice president in a day of terror that left at least five people dead, has earned him pariah status in washington. but while mr. hawley's role in the riot may have left him shunned — at least for now — in official circles, it may only have improved his stock with his party's base in his home state, which remains deeply loyal to mr. trump. he has remained defiant, arguing wednesday evening that the electoral count in congress was the proper venue to debate his concerns about fraud in the balloting, though he never made a specific charge of wrongdoing. many republicans dismissed his effort as grandstanding intended to further his own political ambitions. some democratic senators demanded his resignation.

three major illusions led us. first, capitalism's victory over communism meant that the more unbounded capital was, through freer trade and more open capital markets, the better off americans — and the world — would be. second, as america's military superiority was now overwhelming, we had the right, the ability and the obligation to dictate the terms of global peace, and to enforce that peace by making war. finally, as freedom had proved itself superior to tyranny, americans no longer had any reason to accept limits on their autonomy, or any reason to worry that other nations might take a different view of freedom than we did. guided by these illusions, we drove our ship of state straight onto the rocks: we dismantled our industrial base, mired ourselves in unwinnable wars and tore apart the social fabric that bound city to country, worker to employer and soldier to civilian.

mr. biden said the jobs report showed that we need to provide more immediate relief for working families and businesses now, and he said he would be laying out the groundwork next week for another relief package. the president-elect also called the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine a travesty and said billions of dollars would be needed for that effort. mr. biden's comments came on the same day that his transition team said he planned to release nearly all available coronavirus vaccine doses to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. the move represents a sharp break from the trump administration's practice of holding back some of the vaccine for people to receive their second dose. mr. biden also formally announced nearly two dozen members of his national security council staff on friday, including a senior official for global health threats. thomas kaplan and

senator josh hawley, republican of missouri, plans to object to pennsylvania's electors, and other republican senators could still join the mix. house republicans are preparing to object to the electors from another three states — michigan, nevada and wisconsin — but under law, they can force a debate and vote on their challenges only if a senator agrees to join them. none are expected to be successful. but by objecting, mr. cruz and the other republicans are ensuring that mr. trump will get one final stand in congress to argue his baseless claims of widespread election fraud. senate republican leaders fear it will fracture the party. the person familiar with mr. cruz's thinking, who requested anonymity, said mr. cruz was seeking not to overturn the election but to draw attention to his idea of forming an election audit commission. there is little chance that will happen, and every state has already certified the results after verifying their accuracy.

doctors worry that a covid-related loss of smell could have negative mental health consequences. katherine hansen, a real estate agent who lives near seattle, was sick with covid-19 in march and has still not regained her senses of taste and smell. credit... jovelle tamayo for the new york times until march, when everything started tasting like cardboard, katherine hansen had such a keen sense of smell that she could recreate almost any restaurant dish at home without the recipe, just by recalling the odors. then the coronavirus arrived. one of ms. hansen's first symptoms was a loss of smell, and then of taste. ms. hansen still cannot taste food, and says she can't even tolerate chewing it. now she lives mostly on soups and shakes. i'm like someone who loses their eyesight as an adult, said ms. hansen, a real estate agent who lives outside seattle. they know what something should look like. i know what it should taste like, but i can't get there. a diminished sense of smell, called anosmia, is recognized as one of the telltale symptoms of covid-19, often the first, and sometimes the only one. frequently accompanied by an inability to taste, anosmia occurs abruptly and dramatically in covid, almost as if a switch has been flipped. most patients regain their senses of smell and taste after they recover, usually within weeks. but in a minority of patients like ms. hansen, the loss persists, and doctors cannot say when or if the senses will return.
ms. phenix said she voted for mr. perdue and ms. loeffler, but that if mr. trump had been elected, she would have voted for the democrats. jasmine knapp, a 30-year-old dalton resident, said she was ready for the flood of campaign texts and television advertisements to end. ms. knapp, who declined to say who she supported, described herself as a conservative who voted republican, but said she had not agreed with how some, like mr. trump, had claimed the election in november was rigged. you always hear every election cycle that this vote matters more than anything, she said, but that feels true this time. richard fausset, sean keenan , astead w. herndon and
in a 52-page complaint filed in circuit court in st. louis, a group that included the city, the county and the st. louis regional convention and sports complex authority — which operates the team's former stadium, in downtown st. louis — said that team executives, league officials and other teams' owners had encouraged them to try to build a new stadium to keep the rams. then the owners disregarded those efforts without explanation and voted to let the team move to california, the complaint says.
but ms. murkowski, who quickly acknowledged mr. biden's victory once the election was called, is one of the very few calling openly for mr. trump to leave office, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, before mr. biden is inaugurated on jan. 20. representative adam kinzinger of illinois — who, like ms. murkowski, had been critical of mr. trump before this week's events — is on record supporting the removal of mr. trump's powers under the 25th amendment, and representative steve stivers of ohio has said he would not oppose that move if mr. trump's cabinet decided to do it. senator ben sasse of nebraska has said he would consider voting to remove mr. trump from office if the house impeached him again. but ms. murkowski is the first republican senator to call unequivocally for the president's resignation.
false reports of a new 'u.s. variant' originated from dr. deborah birx on the task force. dr. deborah birx, white house coronavirus response coordinator, during an event at the white house in november. credit... anna moneymaker for the new york times reports of a highly contagious new variant in the united states, published on friday by multiple news outlets, are based on speculative statements made by dr. deborah birx and are inaccurate, according to several government officials. the erroneous report originated at a recent meeting where dr. birx, a member of the white house coronavirus task force, presented graphs of the escalating cases in the country. she suggested to other members of the task force that a new, more transmissible variant originating in the u.s. might explain the surge, as another variant did in britain. her hypothesis made it into a weekly report sent to state governors. this fall/winter surge has been at nearly twice the rate of rise of cases as the spring and summer surges. this acceleration suggests there may be a usa variant that has evolved here, in addition to the uk variant that is already spreading in our communities and may be 50% more transmissible, the report read. aggressive mitigation must be used to match a more aggressive virus. dismayed, officials at the c.d.c. tried to have the speculative statements removed, but were unsuccessful, according to three people familiar with the events. c.d.c.
pelosi threatens to pursue impeachment if trump's cabinet does not strip him of powers. video following the u.s. capitol riot, speaker nancy pelosi on thursday called on vice president mike pence to invoke the 25th amendment to strip president trump of his powers. credit credit... by reuters the top democrats in congress called on thursday for president trump's immediate removal from office for his role in urging on the violent mob that overtook the capitol a day before, disrupting the ratification of president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s electoral victory. speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york called on vice president mike pence to invoke the 25th amendment, which allows him and the cabinet to wrest the power of the presidency from mr. trump. if mr. pence declines to act, they said, democrats were prepared to impeach mr. trump for a second time. while it's only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for america, ms. pelosi said, calling mr. trump's actions on wednesday a seditious act. the speaker's plan was announced during an extraordinary news conference in the reclaimed capitol, hours after the building was overrun by a mob of trump supporters who temporarily halted congress's confirmation of mr. biden's victory in the presidential election. speaking to reporters, ms. pelosi singled out members of the cabinet by name, asking why they would not intervene. are they ready to say for the next 13 days this dangerous man can assault our democracy?

mr. pak said in a news release that he had sought to be thoughtful and consistent, and to provide justice for my fellow citizens in a fair, effective and efficient manner during his tenure, and he thanked mr. trump for the opportunity to serve. people who have spoken with mr. pak said that they had expected his departure and that he had been looking for other work. but mr. pak's decision to leave on the same day he announced his departure took people in the department by surprise. on his weekend phone call with brad raffensperger, the georgia secretary of state, mr. trump complained about the quality of the investigation into claims of voter fraud in the state, especially in fulton county, which includes atlanta. you have your never-trumper u.s. attorney there, he said. while mr. trump did not criticize mr. pak by name, and he was not the only u.s. attorney in georgia, the president has lately become focused on the specious claim that poll workers in fulton county manipulated the vote count.
in november, more than half a million americans came to mexico — of those, almost 50,000 arrived at mexico city's airport, according to official figures, less than half the number of u.s. visitors who arrived in november last year, but a surge from the paltry 4,000 that came in april, when much of mexico was shut down. since then, numbers have ticked up steadily: between june and august, u.s. visitors more than doubled.

these days, they share a common orientation toward mr. de blasio. mr. jeffries and mr. stringer have both prodded him on matters of policy: mr. stringer issuing audits from his perch as comptroller, mr. jeffries employing the megaphone that federal office provides. both have chided mr. de blasio, on occasion, for his perceived fixation on national politics.
in an increasingly visual age, how you look is part of the message you are communicating. that photo of ms. pelosi in an orange coat and dark glasses is more effective than any logo at communicating women's relish at being on the front lines. (the director barry jenkins even put it on a sweatshirt , which he is giving away.)
although this has been in place, paramedics have been transporting some of these patients to emergency departments, dr. gausche-hill wrote in an email in response to questions about the policies. we suggest that they don't, she continued, because the emergency department would not offer any additional therapeutic interventions. she added that the policy allowed exceptions for cases where the scene was unsafe or when emergency crews had particular concerns that need to be discussed with a physician. ambulances used to regularly rush patients without a heartbeat to a hospital, a practice known as scoop and run, but that changed about a decade ago, according to dr. david k. tan, president of the national association of e.m.s. physicians. these days, he said, the standard of care is to understand that cardiac arrest is an e.m.s. problem, it's not a hospital problem, and that a patient's chances of survival are better to work them where you find them. several medics around the country, like kari dickerson, a paramedic in kentucky who tweets as @medictrommasher, jumped into social media to try to quell anxieties about the directive they believed were unfounded. the people i saw most upset were black and brown people, said ms. dickerson, who said that she had to explain to her parents that this is stuff we already do. she said that she read posts by people expressing fears that medics were just going to leave people on the floor and that e.m.s.
general suleimani, who led the quds force of the islamic revolutionary guards corps, oversaw an iranian program to surround israel with tens of thousands of missiles, according to experts.
but since president trump ordered the drone strike on friday that killed maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the mastermind of iran's regional efforts, however pleased they might have been, the predominate response from america's friends in the region has been silence.

legislators have often turned to reconciliation to pass health policy when their majority is slim. democrats used it in 2010 to pass final tweaks to the affordable care act after losing their supermajority. republicans used it in a failed effort to repeal the health law in 2017 and in a successful attempt later the same year to make changes to the tax code.

one such owner noted in the article is vision property management, based in columbia, s.c., which has more than 6,000 homes across the nation. in maryland, where the company has been fined and sued for lead contamination, it has argued that its contracts held the occupants wholly responsible for repairs. in minnesota, where it was sued for a lead paint problem, it has argued that the occupants should have seen a posted warning sign. another big player, harbour portfolio advisors of dallas, recently refused to comply with a formal request for information from the consumer financial protection bureau, which is investigating potential abuse, deception and predation in contracts for deed. the agency has sued the company in federal court in michigan to obtain the information.

biden picks gina raimondo for commerce secretary and martin walsh for labor secretary. president-elect joseph r. biden jr. has selected gov. gina raimondo of rhode island for commerce secretary. credit... gretchen ertl for the new york times president-elect joseph r. biden jr. picked gina m. raimondo, the governor of rhode island, as his commerce secretary and mayor martin j. walsh of boston as his labor secretary, as he moves to fill key economic positions that are expected to play a significant role in his administration. mr. biden also named isabel guzman, a small business advocate and former obama administration official, to run the small business administration. mr. walsh, 53, led boston's powerful building and construction trades council for two years before winning his race for mayor in 2013 with strong backing from organized labor. he is expected to work on fulfilling mr. biden's promise to implement stronger worker protections amid the pandemic and to boost worker pay. it will fall to the next labor secretary to revisit a number of key regulations issued by the department under president trump, including a rule that makes it harder for employees of contractors and franchises to recover stolen wages from parent companies when their direct employers lack the resources to do so.
so the economists' focus turned to the commonalities. human and pet health care are both provided by experts — doctors and veterinarians — who've undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing. that expertise commands high salaries. it also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests, the need for which most consumers cannot independently judge.
mr. castro announced his endorsement on monday morning, just days after he ended his own bid for the white house. in a statement, mr. castro cast ms. warren as the logical extension of his campaign's social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through targeted policy proposals. he will campaign with ms. warren this week, joining her tuesday night at a rally at kings theatre in brooklyn.
it makes you think that the emotional nature of the treatment decision may be important in explaining high and sometimes heroic end-of-life health care spending, ms. finkelstein said, whether on your dog or on your mother.
in new mexico, a lawmaker reported that the state police were evacuating the capitol, while mayor michael b. hancock of denver instructed city government buildings to close as about 700 people gathered outside the statehouse there. the authorities in texas shut down the capitol building in austin out of an abundance of caution. trump supporters burned an effigy of gov. kate brown of oregon outside the capitol in salem and later fought with counterprotesters. in arizona, they set up a guillotine. more than 500 people gathered in lansing, mich., praying and carrying a mix of flags and guns. we have a restored voice in michigan, said rick warzywak, one of the organizers of the rally from atlanta, mich. no matter what happens today in d.c., do not be discouraged. we're going to be in a consistent battle for weeks to come and we're not going to give up. in sacramento, gov. gavin newsom of california canceled a news briefing on the coronavirus to ensure the safety of his staff, he said in a statement. outside the grounds of the california state capitol, which had been cordoned off with barriers and was being patrolled heavily by the police, a few hundred trump supporters demonstrated for a few hours, waving flags and listening to the president's address. the sacramento police reported physical altercations between the group and counterprotesters and several arrests for possession of pepper spray before the gathering was organically dispersed by a cold afternoon rainstorm.
jean-marie guéhenno, a former diplomat and the former president of the international crisis group, asked on twitter: should we be reassured on u.s. democracy when 10 former defense secretaries warn against use of the military to dispute election results, or terrified that they believe taking a public stance has become necessary?
secretary of state mike pompeo, in a major speech in cairo on thursday, rebuked the obama administration's policies in the middle east and hailed the accomplishments of the trump administration.
but mr. trump not only insisted that he would pick an anti-abortion justice to replace antonin scalia — whose seat has been vacant since he died last year — he signed a four-part pledge to take policy steps considered vital to the movement, including a commitment to sign a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, if such legislation reaches his desk.

we must take control of our own destiny by changing the nature of jewish life in fundamental ways. the survival of the jewish people is too important--to us and to the world at large--to be left in the hands of those ultra-orthodox rabbis who would rather face armageddon than change the religious status quo. just as jews of the past changed the nature of jewish life in order to adapt to external necessities and to survive the ravages of their external enemies, so, too, must today's jews change the nature of jewish life to adapt to new internal necessities and to survive the demographic challenges of intermarriage, assimilation, low birthrates, and the breakdown of neighborhoods and communities.
one time he came back to the room, and it was the only time i ever saw him perturbed, recalled robert j. dieter, a roommate at yale. somebody had attacked his dad over the vietnam war. george had a hard time with what is now known as the politics of personal destruction, where you don't debate the merits of an issue but instead you attack the person. apparently people had disparaged his father as a person, and that upset george a lot.
rent-to-own and similar housing schemes exist in a legal gray area in which owners can maneuver to avoid consumer-protection laws, norms and regulations that apply to landlords and mortgage lenders. landlords are generally responsible for keeping rental homes in good repair, including lead abatement, while renters are usually entitled to get their deposits back when they move. no such safeguards exist in the murky world of installment contracts.
but the meandering nature of the phone call and the fact that the president made no apparent attempt to conceal his actions as other call participants listened could allow mr. trump to argue that he did not intend to break the law or to argue that he did not know that a federal law existed apparently prohibiting his actions.
in all of 2017, the standard & poor's 500-stock index experienced no decline greater than 3 percent, the first time that had happened. and a widely followed volatility index known as the vix closed below 10 on more than 40 days in a six-month period through late november, according to citi research. before that, the vix had not closed below 10 on more than six days in any six-month period.
according to them, a standard american home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. in many places, that's what the prices roughly are. but for a few metropolitan areas like san francisco and boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.
supportive of progressive policies that would reduce economic inequality at the margins — e.g. shoring up social security, medicare, and medicaid, supporting increases in the minimum wage, and so forth — but i'm skeptical that they would be enthusiastic about more dramatic policy proposals that would require large tax increases on high incomes.
ms. devos was one of the most effective, polarizing and longest-serving cabinet members in the trump administration. she was seen as fiercely loyal to the president, at least publicly. in her resignation letter, ms. devos praised president trump for championing her school choice agenda, in which she sought to bolster voucher programs that allow students to seek alternatives to public schools. she also saluted one aspect of his coronavirus response, saying that she believed history will show we were correct in our repeated urging of and support for schools reopening this year. but it was loyalty to her constitutional oath, ms. devos said, that had prompted her to resign. impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us, she said. they must know from us that america is greater than what transpired yesterday. ms. devos's resignation drew cheers from her opponents, particularly teacher's unions and groups that had forcefully opposed her rollbacks of civil rights protections for children of color and transgender students. randi weingarten, the president of the american federation of teachers, issued a two-word statement: good riddance. but other critics praised her for protesting the president's actions. this doesn't make up for all of her bad decisions, and the harm she has done to education reform, but still, she deserves kudos for this one, tweeted michael j. petrilli, the president of the thomas b. fordham institute, a conservative research organization. erica l. green and
the lack of a useful grand strategy has been apparent for a long time. shortly after the sept. 11 attacks, one of us, ms. field, at the time an army officer, was dispatched to central command to help prepare for the invasion of iraq, a country that wasn't involved in the assault on our cities. she wondered what objective would lead us to target a third party a thousand miles from afghanistan. what overarching plan, what strategy, justified such a major undertaking? four tours of duty overseas never revealed the answer to her.
unemployment claims remained high in the latest weekly report. the royal divinity food bank in birmingham, ala., says it has been feeding hundreds more families each month since the pandemic began. credit... audra melton for the new york times new claims for unemployment benefits remained high last week, the government reported on thursday, the latest evidence that the pandemic-racked economy still has a lot of lost ground to make up heading into a new year. a total of 922,000 workers filed initial claims for state benefits during the final week of 2020, the labor department said, while another 161,000 new claims were filed under a federal pandemic jobless program. neither figure is seasonally adjusted. on a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 787,000. the labor market has improved since the coronavirus pandemic broke out and closed down the economy. but of the more than 22 million jobs that disappeared in the spring, 10 million remain lost. with a recently enacted $900 billion relief package that includes an extension of federal unemployment benefits, most of the unemployed can at least look forward to more financial help. still, this winter is going to be very difficult, said kathy bostjancic, chief u.s. financial economist at oxford economics. we're seeing overall economic momentum is slowing, and that feeds through to the labor market. employers are very cautious about rehiring at the same time they have had to increase layoffs, ms. bostjancic said, but the resurgence of the virus is really the main culprit here.
rob jackson, chief executive of healthy paws pet insurance, said insurance could protect against budget-busting events costing thousands of dollars. (healthy paws said a pet's age affects premiums at initial enrollment, and also as the pet ages.) the healthy paws website cites examples like fridgey the bengal cat, who had a $4,600 hip replacement, and lupa the german shepherd, who needed $52,000 in treatment for tetanus exposure.
mr. warnock's own twitter feed showed how quickly the mood among democrats had shifted. at 1:55 p.m. eastern, he toasted his victory by thanking georgia voters, saying he was forever grateful. within two hours, he was quoting another pastor of ebenezer baptist church — the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. — with a message of togetherness in the face of hatred and bigotry.

the money, about $22 million, bought equipment and materials to build a road, a seemingly uncontroversial task. the catch? many workers on the construction site are forced conscripts, and the european union has no real means of monitoring the project.
like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young iranians. we continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities, robert gibbs, mr. obama's press secretary, said in a statement on june 13, the day election results were announced and protests erupted.
only a few small union drives have succeeded in tech in the past. workers at the crowdfunding site kickstarter and at the app development platform glitch won union campaigns last year, and a small group of contractors at a google office in pittsburgh unionized in 2019. thousands of employees at an amazon warehouse in alabama are also set to vote on a union in the coming months.
he has not taken public stands on the fee or on how to ensure the broadcaster's financial viability as more viewers turn to streaming services. but his connections to the party may help smooth the negotiating process. mr. sharp, 64, donated more than £400,000 ($542,000) to the conservative party between 2001 and 2010, according to public records.

i don't know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments, said bill hoagland, a longtime republican budget aide in the senate and now a senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center. you need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which he's taken off the table. it is a proposal, i dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a republican congress.
one of those 2016 advisers, rich pelletier, who served as national field director and deputy campaign manager, was let go thursday from the main volunteer effort trying to draft mr. sanders to run in 2020 after the times reported on accounts that he mishandled concerns about allegations of mistreatment.

during the past month, infections at the state's prisons have nearly doubled and deaths have increased by more than 30 percent, according to a new york times database tracking coronavirus cases in the nation's correctional facilities. the state's handling of the virus has come under repeated criticism. recently, planned transfers of medically vulnerable inmates from san quentin to other prisons were abruptly halted after public objections. this spring, another inmate transfer ultimately led to more than 2,600 infections of inmates and guards and 28 inmate deaths at san quentin. the crowded, unsanitary conditions in prisons have made them epicenters for the virus. in recent weeks, there have been heated discussions in some states about whether inmates should receive vaccinations ahead of others. the infection rate among inmates is more than four times higher than rates among members of the general public, and the death rate is twice as high. at avenal, which state figures say is at 116 percent occupancy, thai tran, 43, tested positive for the virus last month. before he fell ill, he had been sleeping in a crowded gym with some 140 other inmates, said his wife, michelle tran. if incarcerated people are to be kept safe from the virus, inmates and correctional officers alike should receive vaccinations, ms. tran said. my husband didn't go to walmart and pick it up, ms. tran said. he didn't go to the market and get it. it's coming in from those coming in from the outside.

we will never concede, mr. trump said at the rally. at the capitol, some lawmakers who were taken to secure locations blamed the president for the uprising. this is what the president has caused today, this insurrection, senator mitt romney, republican of utah, said. some former administration officials publicly tried to encourage mr. trump to take a tougher stand to quell the escalating chaos, while other allies privately pressed him to do more. the president's tweet is not enough, mick mulvaney, the former acting white house chief of staff, wrote on twitter. he can stop this now and needs to do exactly that. tell these folks to go home. in a joint statement, senator chuck schumer and speaker nancy pelosi, the democratic leaders, said, we are calling on president trump to demand that all protesters leave the u.s. capitol and capitol grounds immediately. but mr. trump resisted those private and public entreaties to make any outright condemnation of the violence. instead, his ire was more focused on vice president mike pence, who earlier in the day made clear that he planned to reject the president's pressure to block congressional certification of mr. biden's victory. mr. pence was evacuated from the senate chamber as the tension escalated. mike pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. usa demands the truth!
this is very important. because we have to ask ourselves, how did a socialist bureaucratic system get this kind of adaptability that you didn't see in eastern europe? it's due to the specific historical experiences of this party [in the 1930s and 1940s before coming to power]. it controlled very spread-out and not contiguous districts. so when it tried something like land reform it was done experimentally and in a decentralized fashion. this was fundamentally different from the soviet union.
previous studies of infection risk during air travel did not clearly quantify the risk, and onboard air filtration systems are thought to reduce the infection risk among passengers even when a flight includes one or more infected people. but at least two recent reports strongly suggest that in-flight outbreaks are a risk: one of a flight from boston to hong kong in march; the other of a flight from london to hanoi, vietnam, also in march.
before we get to the how of trump's removal, though, i want to spend a little more time on the why — because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. both george w. bush and barack obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of congress no less.
pet health insurance is also much less common. more than 90 percent of americans now have health insurance, an industry that has been with us since before world war ii. but only 1 percent of dogs and cats are insured for pet care, a relatively new product. (according to the north american pet health insurance association, the first pet health insurance policy in the united states was written for lassie, the tv dog star, in 1982.)

the arithmetic is as simple as it is disorienting. if a corporate executive gets a $100,000 bonus for steering a company through a difficult year, while four $25,000-per-year restaurant workers lose their jobs entirely, the net effect on total compensation is zero — even though in human terms a great deal of pain has been incurred.
but his government is not exactly claiming credit for the crackdown underway, which so far has netted only political opponents, leading to accusations that mr. macri is using the judicial system to neutralize the opposition.
the biggest problem so far has not been a lack of vaccine, but the difficulties that state and local governments face in distributing the doses they have. capacity and logistics, not shortages, are keeping vaccines from being administered. dr. leana s. wen, an emergency physician and public health expert at the george washington university school of public health, said she was surprised and concerned about mr. biden's new strategy. this is not the problem we're trying to solve right now, dr. wen said. speaking at a news briefing on friday, dr. stephen m. hahn, the f.d.a. commissioner, urged states that have used only a small part of their supply to begin vaccinating lower-priority groups, while still observing government guidelines. most states are still prioritizing frontline health care workers and older americans in group residential settings. expanding the targeted groups will go a long way toward using these vaccines appropriately and getting them into the arms of individuals, dr. hahn said. sheryl gay stolberg, katherine j. wu and

like other chinese provincial leaders, mr. luo has had some dealings with hong kong, especially over investment and business. he held talks with his predecessor, mr. wang, at least once, leading a delegation from shanxi province to hong kong in late 2018. on that visit, mr. luo also met the city's chief executive, carrie lam, to discuss investment opportunities. but he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in hong kong.

senior pentagon officials said that mr. miller assessed that dispatching the nimitz now, before the first anniversary this sunday of general suleimani's death in an american drone strike in iraq, could remove what iranian hard-liners see as a provocation that justifies their threats against american military targets. some analysts said the return of the nimitz to its home port of bremerton, wash., was a welcome reduction in tensions between the two countries.

the widening deficit comes despite a booming economy and a low unemployment rate that would typically help fill the government's coffers. federal spending outpaced revenue by $317 billion over the first three months of the fiscal year, which began in october, the budget office reported. that was 41 percent higher than the same period a year ago, or 17 percent after factoring in payment shifts that made the fiscal 2018 first-quarter deficit appear smaller than it actually was.

here's what scientists know about how the coronavirus variant spreads. two cases of a new coronavirus variant were discovered in colorado this week, and two more in california and florida. above, people outside in denver. credit... daniel brenner for the new york times a more contagious form of the coronavirus is churning in the united states. first identified in britain, the variant already accounts for more than 60 percent of new coronavirus cases in london and its neighboring areas, and there's worry the variant could further exacerbate cases in the u.s. and place greater strain on an already strained health care system. a variant that spreads more easily also means that people will need to religiously adhere to precautions like social distancing, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and improved ventilation — unwelcome news to many americans already chafing against restrictions. we asked experts to weigh in on the evolving research into this new version of the coronavirus. here's what they had to say. the new variant seems to spread more easily between people. the new variant, known as b.1.1.7, seems to infect more people than earlier versions of the coronavirus, even when the environments are the same. scientists initially estimated that the new variant was 70 percent more transmissible, but a recent modeling study pegged that number at 56 percent.
the united states economy is expected to expand 3.5 percent this year, while in china, where the virus first emerged, the economy is projected to expand 7.9 percent. the forecasts are based on the assumption that the rollout of the vaccine will be widespread by the middle of the year. however, if logistical problems arise or if people resist vaccinations, the global economy could expand at a much slower rate of 1.6 percent, the world bank said. the pandemic has cast millions of people into poverty as governments locked down their countries to contain the virus. as many as 150 million people are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty by this year, the world bank said in october. policymakers will need to take steps to reverse the devastating increase in extreme poverty, mr. malpass said in a briefing on tuesday. it may take years for people at the bottom of the income scale to see a sustained improvement in their circumstances, he said. the world bank has $12 billion to help countries coordinate vaccine distribution. the world economy faces an amber alert when it came to debt, mr. malpass said, and the bank will be working to help poor countries ease their debt burdens so that they can focus their resources on health care needs.
since the 1970s, democrats and republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one's own party. both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. the main dynamic for democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional republicans oppose. presidents jimmy carter and bill clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when congress refused to do so. president barack obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.

even as moscow's relations with china continued to deteriorate, hanoi moved away from a pro-chinese stand to a semblance of neutrality. that was because the north vietnamese needed the soviet weapons, especially advanced antiaircraft missiles, to protect themselves against american bombing. but the chinese cultural revolution also helped. the vietnamese leaders resented beijing's effort to stir up radicalism among the sizable community of chinese living in north vietnam. as paradoxical as it sounds, remarked one politburo member, nguyen van vinh, in 1967, at the height of american involvement, the vietnamese do not fear the americans but fear the chinese comrades.

advocates had worried the program would force the inmates' families, many of whom are of limited means, to choose between visiting their loved ones and sending care packages. they pointed out that several of the vendors' catalogs advertised inflated prices for popular goods such as oreo cookies or plain t-shirts, which many family members had previously bought in bulk or at local stores.

the worst is yet to come. in mid-december, the authorities escalated mexico city's alert system to the highest level, which requires an immediate shutdown of all but essential businesses. but the lockdown came weeks after numbers had already reached the critical level of contagion, according to the government's own figures. as in much of the world, the most affluent are often the least affected. in roma norte, on one street corner, working-class mexicans lined up for hours to buy oxygen tanks for their relatives who were sick at home with covid-19, while just blocks away well-off young people lined up for croissants.
those officials say that in some cases, iran has simply given taliban leaders and their family members a refuge from american and afghan forces, hosting them in iran. one afghan official said that general suleimani made a point of allowing the smuggling networks that help finance the taliban to pass unimpeded through iran.

britain granted emergency approval to the covid-19 vaccine developed by moderna on friday, making it the third shot approved for use there. the 17 million doses ordered from the massachusetts-based company are not expected to arrive until spring. doses of the pfizer-biontech and oxford-astrazeneca vaccines are already being administered to thousands of people a day. in the face of skyrocketing infections, prime minister boris johnson has set a goal of vaccinating 13.9 million of the nation's most vulnerable people by mid-february. indonesia 's influential council of muslim clerics announced on friday that a coronavirus vaccine made by the chinese company sinovac was acceptable under islamic law, removing a potential obstacle to its use. the indonesian government is expected to issue an emergency authorization soon that would permit use of the vaccine, with inoculations beginning as soon as next week. the indonesian ulema council, as the body of clerics is known, said it had concluded that the vaccine was free of pork material and therefore halal.
trump's press secretary read a statement 'on behalf of the entire white house' condemning the violence. video transcript back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript mcenany calls for full prosecution for rioters kayleigh mcenany, the white house press secretary, said on thursday the trump administration condemned the violence at the u.s. capitol by trump supporters on wednesday and called for their prosecution. let me be clear: the violence we saw yesterday in our nation's capital was appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the american way. we condemn it, the president and this administration, in the strongest possible terms. it is unacceptable. and those that broke the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. what we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate first amendment rights of the many thousands who came to peacefully have their voices heard in our nation's capital. those who violently besieged our capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for. the core value of our administration is the idea that all citizens have the right to live in safety, peace and freedom. those who are working in this building are working to ensure an orderly transition of power. now it is time for america to unite, to come together, to reject the violence that we have seen. we are one american people under god.

taiwan has had remarkably few covid cases. how long can it last? taiwan has managed to keep the coronavirus at bay because of the government's strict policies. credit... an rong xu for the new york times for months and months, life in taiwan has been, in a word, normal. people have packed pro ball games, attended cello concerts and thronged night markets. its covid-19 death toll can be counted on two hands. it is the kind of success that has created a sinking feeling in the stomachs of many residents: how much longer can the island's good fortune last? the high walls have kept the island from being deluged with infections, but they risk isolating taiwan economically and politically if the rest of the world relaxes its defenses as vaccinations get underway. japan and south korea, two other asian democracies praised for their virus responses, are now grappling with large flare-ups of new infections. for chen shih-chung, taiwan's health minister and head of its epidemic command center, success is all the more reason not to waver on the government's strategy. the island has been sealed off to most visitors since march. people who are allowed to enter still have to quarantine under tight watch for two weeks. the government is not likely to budge on those policies until there are vaccines that are a proven, lasting weapon against the virus, mr. chen said in an interview.
he said he wanted to unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the capitol.

that's the message i take from olivier blanchard's presidential address to the american economic association. to be fair, blanchard — one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the i.m.f. — was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all mmt and say that debt never matters. but his analysis nonetheless makes the fix the debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.
in recent decades, a number of historians — particularly younger scholars trained in vietnamese and other languages — have developed various versions of the civil war interpretation. some of them view the period after the french defeat in 1954 as post-colonial, a time in which long-brewing internal conflicts between competing versions of vietnamese nationalism came to a head. as the historian jessica chapman of williams college puts it, the vietnam war was, at its core, a civil war greatly exacerbated by foreign intervention. others have described it as a civil war that became internationalized.

mr. trump is also said to have discussed in recent weeks the possibility of pardoning himself, an unprecedented and untested use of presidential power, but it is uncertain whether that would ultimately protect him. mr. trump's eldest son, donald trump jr., also told the crowd on wednesday that republicans in congress should back mr. trump's efforts to undo the election result: we're coming for you, he said of lawmakers who refused. and rudolph w. giuliani, mr. trump's personal lawyer, said that to win the election, his supporters would need to engage in trial by combat against democrats. federal prosecutors on thursday filed their first charges stemming from the riot, charging one man with assaulting a police officer and another with illegally possessing a loaded handgun. both criminal complaints were filed in federal district court in washington. the city's metropolitan police department had announced earlier that its officers had arrested nearly 70 people at the riot on charges that included unlawful entry, gun possession and assault. in a separate statement, the capitol police announced the arrests of 14 other people on thursday. the first federal complaint accused mark j. leffingwell of assaulting a capitol police officer around 2:30 p.m. on wednesday in a hallway in the senate wing of the capitol building. the officer, daniel amendola, said in the complaint that mr. leffingwell was part of a crowd that had breached a window.

israel has vaccinated more of its population, by far, than any other country in the world. israel has distributed the vaccine to three times as much of its population as the second-fastest nation, the tiny persian gulf kingdom of bahrain. credit... ammar awad/reuters jerusalem — more than 10 percent of israel's population has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a rate that has far outstripped the rest of the world and buoyed the battered domestic image of the country's leader, benjamin netanyahu, at a critical juncture. israel's campaign, which began dec. 20, has distributed the vaccine to three times as much of its population as the second-fastest nation, the tiny persian gulf kingdom of bahrain, according to figures compiled mostly from local government sources by our world in data. by contrast, less than 1 percent of the population of the united states and only small fractions of the population in many european countries received a vaccine dose by the end of 2020, according to our world in data, though china, the united states and britain have each distributed more doses overall. it's quite an astonishing story, said prof. ran balicer, the chairman of the national advisory team of experts that is counseling the israeli government on its covid-19 response. israel's heavily digitized, community-based health system — all citizens, by law, must register with one of the country's four h.m.o.s — and its centralized government have proved adept at orchestrating a national inoculation campaign, according to israeli health experts.

ms. raimondo, a moderate democrat with a background in the financial industry, has served as governor since 2015. she is seen as a relatively traditional choice for commerce secretary, a sprawling post that oversees relations with the business community but also technology regulation, weather monitoring and the gathering of economic data, among other duties. as governor of rhode island, ms. raimondo introduced training programs, cut taxes and eliminated regulations to support businesses. she clashed with unions but ultimately found compromise as she overhauled the state pension plan. before running for office, she was a founding employee at the investment firm village ventures, which was backed by bain capital, and co-founded her own venture capital firm, point judith capital. ms. raimondo has a law degree from yale university and earned a doctorate from oxford university, where she was a rhodes scholar. as commerce secretary, ms. raimondo will control an agency that was at the forefront of an economic fight with china during the trump administration. a sprawling agency with nearly 50,000 employees, the commerce department has used its vast power to curtail the access of chinese companies to the american market and technology. the department also played a role in levying significant tariffs on trading partners on the basis of national security, under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962. it carried out investigations into the effect of imported steel and aluminum on the domestic industry, which led to president trump imposing global metal tariffs.

for federal workers who may need a safety net or financial assistance as they go without pay, mr. trump said the safety net is going to be having a strong border, especially because government employees support his wall.

ordered that the house of representatives rejects the objection to the electoral vote of the commonwealth of pennsylvania. the votes for president of the united states are as follows: joseph r. biden jr. of the state of delaware has received 306 votes. donald j. trump of the state of florida has received 232 votes. the whole number of electors appointed to vote for vice president of the united states is 538. within that whole number, a majority is 270. the votes for vice president of the united states are as follows: kamala d. harris of the state of california has received 306 votes. michael r. pence of the state of indiana has received 232 votes. the announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice president of the united states, each for the term beginning on the 20th day of january 2021, and shall be entered together with the list of the votes on the journals of the senate and the house of representatives.
rather than close struggling schools, as his predecessor michael r. bloomberg had done, mr. de blasio promised to support them. in november 2014, he and his schools chancellor, carmen fariña, announced a program to funnel resources, training and social services into 94 of the lowest-performing schools.
what he saw on his widely publicized trip shocked a nation used to postwar abundance. americans would be even more shocked to know that 50 years later, the delta remains desperately poor. in the three counties senator kennedy visited, poverty rates for children younger than 18 still hover around 50 percent. too many families there face a hard knot of problems: food deserts, failing schools, poor infrastructure, unhealthy populations, shrinking economies, the long shadow of segregation and discrimination.

disqualification is necessary given mr. trump's anti-democratic response to the 2020 election and the continuing danger that he will pose to constitutional norms if allowed to flirt with a return to power in 2024. indeed, the importance of disqualification in this case is such that the congress should proceed with impeachment even if mr. trump's term in office has already concluded.

25 california prisons have logged more than 1,000 infections. none are in the first wave of vaccinations. elected officials, prison rights advocates and inmates' family members protested for better conditions outside san quentin state prison in july. credit... jim wilson/the new york times california's prison system, which has been exceptionally hard-hit by the coronavirus, has started vaccinating some inmates — but none so far at the 25 prisons that have been most overwhelmed by infections, including san quentin, avenal state prison and the california institution for men. elizabeth gransee, a spokeswoman for j. clark kelso, a court-appointed official who oversees prison health care in california, said on wednesday that the prison system had decided to concentrate its vaccination efforts at facilities where people are at significant risk of becoming infected or severely ill from the coronavirus. but the facilities chosen — the central california women's facility in chowchilla, the california health care facility in stockton and the california medical facility in vacaville — have had far fewer infections and deaths than most other state prisons. ms. gransee would not provide the specific date of when vaccinations started at the three facilities. she also declined to provide other details about the state prison's vaccination program in response to written questions. in all, 25 california prisons have individual caseloads surpassing 1,000. the largest outbreak has been at overcrowded avenal, in central california, which has logged more than 3,500 infections. that is one of the nation's largest known coronavirus clusters.

if the internet companies want to give everyone a voice and create healthier online spaces, perhaps facebook, twitter and youtube should subject the prominent band of habitual online misleaders to stricter rules. this could dial back some of the internet's dangers by penalizing those who do the most harm without stifling a vast majority's free expression.
instead, these voters appeared to be drawn back toward the democrats by some of the party's bread-and butter-issues, and in spite of others. on issues like gun control, health care and the environment, these voters look remarkably like the democratic party's base — those who voted for obama in 2012, hillary clinton in 2016 and a democratic house candidate in 2018. eighty-four percent of obama-trump voters who voted for democratic house candidates in 2018 want to ban assault rifles, compared to 92 percent of the democratic base. by contrast, 57 percent of obama-trump voters who stayed with republicans in 2018 support an assault weapons ban (which has far less support among the republican base).
it is worth looking at the 2016 election which set this chain of events in motion. i was running our ads organization at the time of the election and had been for the four years prior (and for one year after). it is worth reminding everyone that russian interference was real but it was mostly not done through advertising. $100,000 in ads on facebook can be a powerful tool but it can't buy you an american election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).

he had a different kind of a talent, and we should have vocational schools, mr. trump said during a speech at a republican congressional retreat in west virginia. you learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry and all of these things. we don't have that very much anymore. and i think the word 'vocational' is a much better word than in many cases, a community college. a lot of people don't know what a community college means or represents.

toward the end of his presidency, roosevelt appointed a white house commission to study the problems of rural life. among the chief topics of the group's report was the poor state of health in the hinterlands. farms ought to be healthy places to live, the commissioners wrote, but doctors and nurses were scarce, and most rural americans had not been schooled in the rudiments of hygiene. while some states had public health departments, many did not. and because of widespread antipathy to federal power, officials could not intervene except to address outbreaks of disease among farm animals. treading softly, the commission made only mild recommendations: basic education in hygiene and sanitation, and a promise of federal help in health matters if a state requested it.

republican lawmakers join calls for trump's removal. gov. larry hogan of maryland during a news conference in annapolis, md., on thursday. he said president trump should resign or be removed from office. credit... brian witte/associated press some republican lawmakers on thursday joined a chorus of democrats calling for the removal of president trump from office for his role in inciting a riotous mob to storm the u.s. capitol. they did not, however, say if they would support impeaching the president, as speaker nancy pelosi had threatened if vice president mike pence and mr. trump's cabinet failed to strip the president of his powers by invoking the 25th amendment. representative adam kinzinger, republican of illinois and the first republican lawmaker to call for invoking the 25th amendment after the riot, said that mr. trump had abdicated his duty to protect the american people by inciting an insurrection. the president has become unmoored, not just from his duty, or even his oath, but from reality itself, mr. kinzinger, an early opponent of efforts to subvert the results of the election, said in a video posted on twitter. it is time to invoke the 25th amendment and end this nightmare. gov. larry hogan, republican of maryland and a frequent critic of president trump within his party, echoed those calls. i think there's no question that america would be better off if the president would resign or be removed from office, mr. hogan said in a news conference addressing the violence. enough of the lies.
one possible bright spot: this is the first fafsa season in which students could begin filing in october (previously, filers had to wait until jan. 1). because high schools encouraged seniors to file early, many had already filed their fafsas before the data tool shut down. as of feb. 17, high school fafsa filings had increased by 74 percent compared with the same time last year, said carrie warick, director of policy and advocacy at the national college access network.

american jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most american jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. as the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the united states, the era of enormous jewish influence on american life may soon be coming to an end. although jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the united states--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the american people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. but our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on american life will necessarily become marginalized. one harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the american jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the united states celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. other projections suggest that early in the next century, american jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-orthodox hasidim.

to see just how significant mr. suleimani's death truly is, it helps to understand the geopolitical game he'd devoted his life to playing. in lebanon, mr. suleimani built lebanese hezbollah into the powerful state within a state that we know today. a terrorist organization receiving its funds, arms and marching orders from tehran, hezbollah has a missile arsenal larger than that of most countries in the region. the group's success has been astounding, helping to cement iran's influence not just in lebanon but farther around the arab world.

a federal judge in indiana bars further u.s. executions unless more virus precautions are taken. the federal corrections complex in terre haute, ind. credit... bryan woolston/reuters a federal judge in indiana ruled that three federal executions set for next week, including the first of a woman in nearly 70 years, could not go forward unless prison authorities made significant changes to coronavirus prevention measures during the process. the preliminary injunction, from judge jane magnus-stinson, came in a class-action lawsuit brought by two inmates at the federal prison complex in terre haute, ind., where federal executions are held. the inmates, who are not on death row but in a separate, medium-security part of the complex, argued, in part, that the 10 executions the trump administration's prison authorities have carried out since july exposed them to a substantial risk of contracting the virus. the trump administration has appealed prior attempts to block or delay executions, and the supreme court has allowed each one to proceed. during the pandemic, executions have drawn scrutiny for their potential to become super-spreader events. each brings about 50 to 125 people to the terre haute prison complex, according to an estimate by the bureau of prisons, an arm of the justice department. those fighting to halt executions have contended that the number of people involved is in the hundreds. the execution team consists of approximately 40 bureau employees, none of whom regularly work at the complex.

duration is a measure of sensitivity to changing interest rates; the longer the duration, the more the price of a bond will fall when rates rise. for example, dodge & cox income fund, with a duration of around four years, lost 0.9 percent in the first quarter. vanguard long-term bond index fund, with a duration of more than 15 years, lost 3.75 percent.
lisa and james greenberg had lived in fairfield, conn., for almost 20 years when they decided they wanted a house with more privacy and entertaining space than their split-level in the north stratfield section. they liked fairfield, so they focused on another neighborhood, greenfield hill, with a historic district at its center. the area's large lots, old-growth shade trees and winding lanes seemed to offer the space and seclusion the greenbergs desired. but it took a long time to find a house that wasn't too remote or had more land than they wanted to maintain.
it also wants to burnish its credentials in science by becoming a major player in the global vaccine business. even without the regulatory greenlight, china has embarked on an aggressive vaccination drive at home, with the goal of inoculating 50 million people by the middle of next month. beijing has also developed an overseas distribution plan for exports, directing airlines to stock up on refrigerators and dry ice. china is filling a void in poorer nations left by western competitors. the united states is mainly focused on working through the chaos of distributing its vaccines at home. the european union and other rich countries have bought many of the doses supplied by the american drugmakers pfizer and moderna. the chinese have been eager to get out in front, aware of the gap and the hoarding and pre-purchase of so many billions of doses by the western governments that is leaving so many countries high and dry, said j. stephen morrison, director of the global health policy center at the center for strategic and international studies. it will become a tool in their diplomatic alliances, and it will give them some measure of prestige and standing with countries that choose to make use of them, he added.
of course, my children would claim that we rarely sat down to breakfast — we often just grabbed things on the run. and they might point out that when we did sit down, i surreptitiously read the newspaper at the breakfast table. and i pulled a book out of my bag at the playground if i thought i could get away with it. speaking of old technologies, at our day care center there was one father — a big-shot professor — who was so brave that he did the worktime while wearing his walkman (remember those?).

trump's fraud claims could hurt georgia's republican candidates. georgia republicans have been concerned that president trump's efforts to undermine the election process will depress turnout in the runoffs. credit... erin schaff/the new york times the elections in georgia won't just determine the fate of the two senate seats there and the balance of power on capitol hill. it will also reveal the extent to which president trump has disrupted and damaged his own party. for the past several weeks, mr. trump has instigated and intensified a battle in the georgia republican universe as he has sought to overturn his loss in the state and blame republican leaders there for not helping him. in response, the state's republicans have turned on one another, taking sides for or against the president as he continues in his obstinate — some say unlawful — effort to overturn the election results in georgia, where he lost by nearly 12,000 votes. the outcome of these senate runoffs will show, on one level, how republican voters have reacted to mr. trump's quest to upend what he has falsely called a rigged election. if republicans ultimately do not turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on the president for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the election process.

this tragic loss is a reminder of the bravery of the law enforcement who protect us every day, mr. ryan wrote. mr. sicknick's death brings the death toll from wednesday's mayhem to five. one of the people participating in the pro-trump rampage, ashli babbitt, was shot and killed by a capitol police officer inside the building as she climbed through a broken window leading to the speaker's lobby. three other people died after experiencing apparent medical emergencies in the area around the capitol, the police said. officials have said that some 50 police officers were injured as the mob swarmed barricades, threw objects, battered doors, smashed windows and overwhelmed some of the officers who tried to resist the advancing crowd. capitol police reported 14 arrests during the incursion, including two people who were detained for assaulting a police officer. local police arrested dozens of others, mostly for unlawful entry and violations of the city's wednesday night curfew. steven sund, the capitol police chief, handed in his resignation on thursday after facing pressure from congressional leaders. the sergeants-at-arms of the house and senate also resigned.

we want change, we want change ... i don't understand why i could still go in a store and buy a weapon of war. there's no better time than now to talk about gun control. these are calls the american public has heard before. after orlando — democrats and republicans we spoke with agree, suspected terrorists, like the orlando shooter, should not be allowed to purchase firearms. after sandy hook — 90 percent of americans support universal background checks. after each mass shooting, there's a surge of public support for stricter gun control. a new poll from quinnipiac university shows record high support for stricter gun laws. so why hasn't washington put stricter gun laws on the books? there are several factors, ranging from partisan divides to gun owner activism to the n.r.a. 's political clout. no. 1: there's broad support, but also big divisions on gun control. the most comprehensive data is from 2017, and it shows that 60 percent of americans say they want stricter gun laws. support is even higher for things like a 30-day waiting period for gun sales and universal background checks. but dig deeper, and you find the devil is in the details — and the divides. most democratic voters want stricter gun laws. but less than 1 in 4 republicans agree. most americans who don't own firearms say easy access to legal guns fuels gun violence. fewer than half of gun owners agree. non-owners want to ban assault-style weapons, while most gun owners don't.

the subject of mr. hawley's book, which was already available for preorder on amazon and other retailers, is not about the election or mr. trump, but about technology corporations like google, facebook and amazon. its cancellation was remarkably swift and raised questions about how publishers will approach future books by conservatives who have supported mr. trump's efforts to invalidate the election. it's unclear if mr. hawley will have to return his book advance, or whether simon & schuster will forfeit it. it also remains to be seen whether mr. hawley will seek another publisher or self-publish the book. read more

by far the biggest news this week — arguably the most consequential foreign policy news in years — was the killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani, iran's top security and intelligence commander, on president trump's orders. the geopolitical and national security implications are immense, and you can read more about them here.
terry johnson, a roommate of mr. bush who entered dke at the same time, recalled: one of the techniques of demonstrating what an abominable person you are is to ask you to name all your fellow pledges. it's a way of humiliating somebody in front of their fellow pledges, to show that you're not worthy of entering dke.
it was not immediately clear whether mr. laturner had been in the same location as ms. wild, though ms. wild said roughly 300 to 400 people were being held in the room with her. as the violent mob stormed the capitol, groups of lawmakers were kept together at secure locations, while others reported being stranded for a time in offices and hideaways throughout the building. videos of the siege showed hundreds of members of the mob, most of them unmasked, clashing with capitol police officers and journalists inside the capitol and on the surrounding grounds. mr. laturner's announcement came after two other republicans, representatives kevin brady and kay granger, both from texas, had tested positive for the virus earlier in the week. both mr. brady and ms. granger were not in the capitol on wednesday because they were in quarantine.
to say that i am troubled by president trump's attempt to manipulate the votes of georgians would be an understatement, mr. worley, who is the sole democrat on the five-member board, wrote in the email. once we have received your investigative report, it will be the board's duty to determine whether probable cause exists to refer this matter.

what we have managed to rebuild over the last 30 years with the help of those neighbors is real. it is strong and it has emerged not only from government policy, but also from grass-roots efforts. we've built jewish schools, synagogues, community centers and museums by working hand in hand with non-jewish high school students, senior citizens and many others. not only have they allowed these institutions to be born and flourish, but many have stood up and taken an active part in jewish rebirth.
but while the united states was spending hundreds of billions of dollars in afghanistan, and cycling nearly a million american troops through in the 18 years of war, iran changed its policy, deciding to nurture the taliban when it was useful. general suleimani was central to that effort, according to united states and afghan officials, which has given iran a hedge against the united states in afghanistan at very little cost.

the effect on stocks is more mixed, with diversified indexes like the dow jones industrial average and s&p 500 flat or up as the tech-heavy nasdaq sank. companies whose fortunes are linked closely to the overall economy would benefit from a bigger stimulus and infrastructure spending. efforts to accelerate vaccination programs would also help industries that rely on in-person interactions get back in business.
a political housecleaning appeared underway as well in the sanders camp: three top advisers from the 2016 campaign either will not return if mr. sanders runs in 2020 or will serve in different roles, according to people close to mr. sanders.

at the same time that he was earning c's at yale, mr. bush demonstrated a feat that old friends still shake their heads about. it was his induction into the delta kappa epsilon fraternity, or dke, and the sophomores were cowering downstairs in the fraternity's lovely red-brick building (now the alumni center) as older students hit them and shouted insults as part of the hazing process.
the paper didn't include close measures of whether people who stopped smoking completely quit nicotine, the most healthful possible outcome for smokers. while it is clear that most vaping products are safer than cigarettes, it is not yet clear by how much. new research is emerging that vaping products may cause some long-term lung and heart disease. and a recent poisoning outbreak associated mainly with thc, in which 55 people died, suggests that there can be acute health risks for some users.

the fed's decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting, in mid-december, drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth. asset prices imply an expectation that the fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019.
united states regulatory filings now provide a partial answer to that question — and an unconventional answer at that. the buyer is supplying $5 billion of equity, equating to roughly 11 percent of syngenta's value. for a conventional western private equity deal, that would be far too thin a sliver for lenders or regulators — but then, this deal is effectively backed by the people's republic of china.

mr. sanders views his consistent diplomacy-over-conflict stance — dating to his opposition to the vietnam war and his anti-interventionist foreign policy as mayor of burlington, vt. — as an advantage with working-class americans who are frustrated with the country's involvement in costly and distant wars.
in this way, i view myself — and imagine others — caught in a double bind. my depression springs from my biology, my biography, my choices. but it occurs within a far broader context that could bring just about anyone down, and apparently does. the fact is that the country is not red and blue. it is almost entirely blue.
the department's responsibilities also include areas that are expected to be central to the biden administration, such as economic promotion, making it a potentially powerful force in the type of industrial policy that is increasingly embraced in washington. the department promotes u.s. business abroad through the foreign commercial service, and strategically important businesses at home by providing grants through the economic development administration.

new assessments suggest that india is considering allowing for pre-emptive nuclear strikes against pakistan's arsenal in the event of a war. this would not formally change india's nuclear doctrine, which bars it from launching a first strike, but would loosen its interpretation to deem pre-emptive strikes as defensive.
biden plans to release nearly all available vaccine doses in an attempt to speed delivery. sergeant brian patrick mcknerney of the new jersey state police received a coronavirus vaccination in rockaway, n.j., on friday. credit... sarah blesener for the new york times in a sharp break with the trump administration, president-elect joseph r. biden jr. intends to release nearly all available doses of the coronavirus vaccine soon after he is inaugurated, rather than hold back millions of vials to guarantee second doses will be available. the decision is part of an aggressive effort to to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, the biden transition team said on friday. the vaccination plan, to be formally unveiled next week, also will include federally run vaccination sites in places like high school gyms and sports stadiums, and mobile units to reach high-risk populations. the president-elect has vowed to get at least 100 million covid vaccine shots into the arms of the american people during his first 100 days in office. the decision to release the vast majority of vaccine doses set off a sharp debate among public health experts. the two vaccines that have received emergency approval each require two doses, and the trump administration has so far been holding back about half of its supply to ensure that booster doses will be available for those already inoculated.

insofar as he encouraged people to storm the capitol, and insofar as the president consistently has cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, i believe that that was completely wrong, mr. johnson said at a news conference in london.

the california policy would be the nation's biggest test of the idea that longer leave, by encouraging parents not to quit their jobs and by delaying the need to pay for infant care, can help economic growth.
mr. bolton is also handicapped by not having a deputy, who traditionally coordinates policy debates. he has yet to replace mira ricardel, an official who was forced out of the white house after she clashed with the first lady, melania trump.
realizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. their goal: a california law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates. after an earlier lobbying push, legislators have already voted to protect the companies from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires, and utilities are seeking the same for 2018.
i think that we can expect more of this in the future now that the line's been crossed, said peter r. mansoor, a retired army colonel and a former aide to mr. petraeus, who is now a professor at ohio state university. i'm not sure it's healthy for civil-military relations.
to those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today: you did not win. violence never wins. freedom wins, and this is still the people's house. when i arrived in washington this morning, i fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes. however, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider, and i cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of these electors. [hitting gavel] on this vote, the yeas are six, the nays are 93. the objection is not sustained. the secretary will notify the house of the action of the senate, informing that body that the senate is now ready to proceed to joint session with further counting of the electoral vote for president and vice president. for what reason does the gentleman from pennsylvania rise? mr. president, sadly but resolutely, i object to the electoral votes of my beloved commonwealth of pennsylvania on the grounds of multiple constitutional infractions that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given. and on this occasion, i have a written objection signed by a senator and 80 members of the house of representatives. in the senate of the united states ordered that the senate, by a vote of seven ayes to 92 nays, rejects the objection to the electoral votes cast in the commonwealth of pennsylvania for joseph r. biden for president and kamala d. harris for vice president.
yet even a steep drop in coal use last year wasn't enough to offset rising emissions in other parts of the economy. some of that increase was weather-related: a relatively cold winter led to a spike in the use of oil and gas for heating in areas like new england.
people are more likely to listen to a message when it comes from someone they trust, alexander maki has argued in the washington post, and messages about climate change are no different. for example, he writes, experimental research discovered that when free-market enthusiasts who are concerned about government regulation hear from experts who emphasize how companies are developing climate responses, they are more likely to accept climate science.

the main disruption mr. inhofe was referring to was the president. making good on a monthslong series of threats, the president vetoed the bipartisan legislation last week, citing a shifting list of reasons, including his objection to a provision directing the military to strip the names of confederate leaders from bases. he also demanded that the bill include the repeal of what is known as section 230, a legal shield for social media companies that he has tangled with. republicans and democrats alike have said that the repeal, a significant legislative change, is irrelevant to a bill that dictates military policy.

if the board concludes a law has been broken, mr. worley said, it could ask state law enforcement authorities to consider filing criminal charges or a civil case against mr. trump.
ms. ocasio-cortez was able to engineer the repeal by attaching it as an amendment to a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan that passed the house in july. if republicans retain control of the senate, this is probably the most realistic path to repeal. infrastructure spending has drawn bipartisan support and killing faircloth in an amendment is easier politically, since it won't force an up-down vote from conservative republicans. still, its easy to imagine conservatives turning the expansion of public housing as a culture war issue, casting it as a giveaway to cities.
look, when you're coming from texas to some of these schools up there, mr. bush said in an interview, there's a -- you know, i can't point to a particular person, but there's that sense of, you know: 'well, maybe these boys from texas aren't quite bright enough to be here. i guess it's geographic distribution that got him here.'

it would also help greatly if congressional republicans would let up on their relentless efforts to weaken the federal consumer bureau so that it could swiftly investigate and reform or outlaw predatory rent-to-own schemes. state and local health and housing officials could also be more active in using their powers to curb risky installment arrangements. but it would be better for federal regulators to eliminate the financial incentives that make such arrangements lucrative in the first place.
this is not rocket science, said richard l. brodsky, a former state assemblyman who has long criticized the use of tax deals to promote private development. if the taxpayer is going to subsidize these projects, the taxpayer needs to see a return, and they're not getting much back for their tax dollars. there's a growing sense that you cannot subsidize your way into economic progress.
museums have been affected, too. the national gallery of art, all 19 smithsonian museums, and the national zoo were closed last week because of the shutdown. (essential personnel remain on hand at the zoo to care for the animals.)
unfortunately, the current state of the white house already reflects the most obvious fix mr. trump could make: bringing in a more empowered and competent chief of staff. by most accounts, john kelly had succeeded in improving the information flow, removing some of the key factional actors and reducing the leaks. a more experienced white house hand could probably do better, but at this point it isn't clear mr. trump could attract that sort of a-list talent.

second, it was clear heading into tuesday that democrats had built up a strong advantage in early and mail-in voting, meaning republicans needed excellent turnout on election day — and there are indications that they may not have gotten it. in some rural, heavily republican counties, it appears that turnout is less than 90 percent of what it was in november, whereas turnout in dekalb county, macon county and potentially other democratic areas is expected to be more than 90 percent of what it was in november. none of this is definitive. only about half of the vote has been counted so far, and the second half could be more favorable to the republicans. but as of halftime, they haven't gotten a lot of good news. read more

my hope for 2019 is a return to the bad weather of the good old days, when california was wetter, texas was dryer and hurricanes were just destructive, not biblical. my hope is that sky rivers revert to rainstorms that simply ruined graduations and picnics, and that snowstorms become a reason to drink hot chocolate under warm blankets again. bad weather used to be an inconvenience that gave us welcome pauses from routine and bloated schedules. nature is now a raging, unrelenting, unpredictable force, unsettling and sometimes downright scary. we are at its mercy and there is no help coming. — john white, newport news, va.

u.s. daily coronavirus cases are higher than ever, but the holidays are distorting the data. a testing site at the university of san diego in california on friday. credit... ariana drehsler for the new york times the united states reported at least 291,300 new coronavirus cases on saturday, a single-day record but one that is inflated because of delays in reporting over the holidays. nineteen states reported no data on friday, which was a public holiday for new year's day. the remaining states reported a total of more than 147,000 new cases on friday. the near doubling of cases on saturday can mostly be explained by many states reporting cases for both friday and saturday, with one state, michigan, reporting cases for thursday as well. other states will wait until sunday or monday to report cases from the past few days, which will continue to distort the totals. regular data reporting is expected to resume toward the end of next week. the country's previous single-day record, according to a new york times database, was 280,514 new cases on dec. 11, though that number was also inflated because of 43,000 cases that were added from a backlog in texas. the highest number of new cases in a single day without any data anomalies was 251,191 on dec. 18. regardless of holiday reporting delays, the united states has had the world's worst outbreak for most of the pandemic and is experiencing a new surge in infections even as vaccine distribution begins.

one way to pay lower premiums, and possibly get broader coverage, is to buy pet insurance through your employer. eleven percent of employers in the united states offer pet health insurance benefits, according to a 2018 survey by the society for human resource management, up from 6 percent in 2014. typically, companies offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. it's uncommon for employers to contribute to the cost of premiums, as they do with human health insurance. but insurers may give employees a break on premiums, or offer better coverage, because their marketing costs are lower.

so what you have to understand about australia is that we have this incredibly unique ecosystem. there are hundreds of species of animals that are endemic, so only found in australia, which include koalas, kangaroos, possums, wallabies, cockatoos, and many other types of bugs and other species. and increasingly, as we've built up the landscape, they've been pushed into these dense parts of bush. and that's what's burning.
mr. biden, a former chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, is making the case that this calls for a candidate with extensive foreign policy experience.
keynes was also an active investor in the stock market, and in the 1920s tried to time stock picks. but his returns were low, and he took a big hit in the market crash of 1929.
mr. powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the american economic association by his immediate predecessors at the fed, janet l. yellen and ben s. bernanke. both of them criticized mr. trump's attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.
the size and nature of the military deployment was unclear. but coming just months after turkey's third military incursion into syria, it expands turkey's military footprint in a volatile region and, analysts say, offers new evidence of its growing self-confidence as a regional power.
that may be the real reason the united states keeps spending so heavily in afghanistan. the pentagon is terrified of a repeat of 1975, when panicked south vietnamese fled saigon as americans pulled out and north vietnamese forces advanced on the city. the united states military did not truly begin to recover from that humiliation until its victory in the persian gulf war of 1991. an abrupt withdrawal from afghanistan could conceivably provide a new symbol of the decline in american hard power.

we've never had a president who was as insensitive to the norms and taboos of the military, mr. feaver said. people like mcchrystal, people like mcraven and the others are responding to the president's breaking of these taboos.
in short, while some students took to the barricades, mr. bush took to the bar.
again, i'm not arguing that warren should necessarily become president. but she is what a serious policy intellectual looks and sounds like in 2019. and if our media can't recognize that, we're in big trouble.
at the same time, mr. certner said, the republican proposal could reduce the financial assistance available to help people pay insurance premiums.
but given that members of the trump administration will be out of a job in 13 days and that democrats will control the white house and both chambers of congress, the resignations and rebukes have little, if any, practical significance. in his interview on cnn, mr. kelly said that mr. trump simply did not listen to dissent within his administration. you don't survive on telling this president the truth, he said. not for very long, anyway.
the kerfuffle over the solyndra collapse aside, many conservatives already agree, and have for years. when i was at the council of economic advisers under president george w. bush, we believed that an across-the-board energy policy was by far the best approach — and that included solar. from both a market and an environmental point of view, supporting the solar industry should make sense, no matter which side of the aisle you come from.
stocks had gained sharply earlier in the day, as the prospect that democrats would take control of the senate pushed investors to bet on a faster growing american economy, a sign that they expect larger government spending with unified democratic control in washington.

misinformation was also real and related but not the same as russian interference. the russians may have used misinformation alongside real partisan messaging in their campaigns, but the primary source of misinformation was economically motivated. people with no political interest whatsoever realized they could drive traffic to ad-laden websites by creating fake headlines and did so to make money. these might be more adequately described as hoaxes that play on confirmation bias or conspiracy theory. in my opinion this is another area where the criticism is merited. this is also an area where we have made dramatic progress and don't expect it to be a major issue for 2020.
truman was (as klobuchar is) a loyal democrat with populist leanings whom many republicans, both senators and voters, nonetheless felt some affection for. he had a folksy manner and heartland accent. he was also a long shot for the nomination when the process began. the analogy extends to klobuchar's best-known weakness: truman had a temper, too.
officials at operation warp speed, the trump administration's vaccine program, had noted that doses would stop being sequestered after the first few weeks of rollout. but the announcement by the biden administration sets the clearest benchmark yet for front-loading shots, then distributing them as they become available. and warp speed officials on friday were critical of the president-elect's decision. the food and drug administration — whose advice mr. biden has pledged to follow — has spoken out strongly against changing the dosing schedule, as some other countries have opted to do, calling such a move premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. some public health experts fear that second doses would be delayed by the decision. but others called it a smart measure and said it was imperative to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible — so long as the second doses are not delayed. the biden team said it was confident that the supply would be enough, and that mr. biden would invoke the defense production act if necessary to bolster the supply of second doses. the president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said t.j. ducklo, a spokesman for the biden transition team.
with both democratic candidates in the lead in georgia, the nasdaq composite index opened around 1 percent lower on wednesday on expectations that technology companies could be hurt by higher corporate taxes and stricter antitrust scrutiny.
army secretary ryan mccarthy told reporters that all 1,100 members of the d.c. national guard had been mobilized on wednesday afternoon to support the local police. he said that several federal law enforcement entities would be working to determine how a clearing operation may be conducted. the decision to mobilize the d.c. national guard — by secretary mccarthy and christopher c. miller, the acting defense secretary — came as a pro-trump mob breached the capitol earlier in the day. defense and administration officials said it was vice president mike pence, not president trump, who approved the order to deploy the d.c. national guard. it was unclear why the president, who incited his supporters to storm the capitol and who is still the commander in chief, did not give the order. president trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the national guard, according to a person with knowledge of the events. it required intervention from the white house counsel, pat cipollone, among other officials, the person familiar with the events said. f.b.i. agents went to the capitol grounds on wednesday to help the police on the scene protect the building and the public. a handful of the f.b.i. agents arrived in camouflage and bearing shields and machine guns late in the afternoon outside the secure location where the senators were being held. and at the request of u.s. national guard officials, gov.
environmental groups assailed the rule as the culmination of a decades-long strategy to undermine science that took off in the tobacco wars of the 1990s and continued as a way to raise doubts about the research upholding pollution rules.
mr. trump is correct about china's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by american tariffs on $250 billion worth of chinese imports. but the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats, including damage from a protracted federal government shutdown, the waning effects of mr. trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and contagion from china's pain to american companies, farmers and consumers, friday's data notwithstanding.
north vietnam's siding with china was a tactical move in the absence of better options. khrushchev himself precipitated this shift by refusing to provide aid. but he blamed his loss of north vietnam on the imaginary machinations of chinese half-breeds in the vietnamese party leadership. for khrushchev, the problem of vietnam was only an aspect of his broader struggle with china, and a rather peripheral aspect at that.

mr. thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months. but for mr. spires, who recently recovered from pneumonia, it took years of effort that will now allow him to have a burial, when the time comes, with military honors.
members of congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward, ms. pelosi said in a statement. our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient war powers act notification and by the administration's briefing today.
more than any other american military operation since the invasion of iraq, the assassination yesterday of maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the head of iran's qods force of its islamic revolutionary guards corps, is a seismic event. the killings of osama bin laden and abu bakr al-baghdadi, the leaders of al-qaeda and the islamic state, were certainly meaningful, but they were also largely symbolic, because their organizations had been mostly destroyed. taking out the architect of the islamic republic's decades-long active campaign of violence against the united states and its allies, especially israel, represents a tectonic shift in middle eastern politics.
and what he said is that he's always believed in climate change, but that it's impossible to link events like the bushfires to any one regulation or policy of a specific country.
the violent insurrection was an attack on the caucus, the congress, the country and the constitution that was incited and facilitated by donald trump, representative hakeem jeffries, democrat of new york and the caucus chairman, said on the call. he must be held accountable for his actions. in a letter to house democrats on friday, ms. pelosi invoked the resignation of richard m. nixon amid the watergate scandal, when republicans prevailed upon the president to resign and avoid the ignominy of an impeachment, calling mr. trump's actions a horrific assault on our democracy. ms. pelosi also said she had spoken with gen. mark a. milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, about preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes. a spokesman for general milley, col. dave butler, confirmed that the two had spoken and said the general had answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority. but some defense department officials have privately expressed anger that political leaders seemed to be trying to get the pentagon to do the work of congress and cabinet secretaries, who have legal options to remove a president. mr. trump, they noted, is still the commander in chief, and unless he is removed, the military is bound to follow his lawful orders. while military officials can refuse to carry out orders they view as illegal, they cannot proactively remove the president from the chain of command. that would be a military coup, these officials said.
for decades, the met followed a pay-as-you-wish tradition, suggesting a $25 payment from every adult but not requiring it. if you wished to put up much less, so be it. in recent years, the share of museumgoers paying the full freight shrank as the suggested price rose to $25 from $12. in 2004, 63 percent of adults paid in full. in 2017, the figure shriveled to 17 percent. the system simply isn't successful anymore, said daniel weiss, the met's president and chief executive. he said his institution is the only major museum anywhere that relies on voluntary fees and doesn't get most of its revenue from the government.
ms. nichols retired in 2016 and has been competing collegiately instead.
and so there's this real divide here between those who see the bushfires in australia as some kind of natural disaster, as a tragedy, and those who see it as a turning point in the conversation about climate change.
caitlin oakley, a spokeswoman for mr. azar, said monday: we are disappointed with the court's ruling and are evaluating next steps. as the court correctly recognized, its judgment has the potential to wreak havoc on the system.
the mortgage finance company will also impose restrictions on future sales of foreclosed homes to firms that engage in abusive forms of seller financing — which includes selling homes on either rent-to-own leases or in long-term installment agreements known as contract for deed.
part of the beauty of the way australians hang out isn't just how relaxed it is, but the inclusive, rolling nature of how they socialize. i showed up for a drink at a friend's place one evening last month and within an hour four people had turned into eight and by the time i left more were en route.
archived recording (scott morrison) in the years ahead, we are going to continue to evolve our policy in this area to reduce emissions even further. and we're going to do it without a carbon tax, without putting up electricity prices — archived recording so if you can do it without a carbon tax and putting up prices, are you willing to — archived recording (scott morrison) — and without shutting down traditional industries upon which regional australians depend for their very livelihood.

jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. et jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. et washington, d.c. mayor issues order extending emergency for 15 days. supporters of president donald trump climb up the side of the capitol to enter in protest. credit... jason andrew for the new york times mayor muriel e. bowser of washington on wednesday night issued an order extending the city's public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support president trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation's capital. the order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety. the directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of president-elect joseph r. biden jr. on jan. 20. it came hours after ms. bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on wednesday until 6 a.m. on thursday. in a statement explaining the extension, ms. bowser pointed to the pro-trump protesters who came to the city for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. they have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns, ms. bowser wrote. they have breached the security of the capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the capitol.
port st. lucie, fla. — david wright, the mets' captain and longest-tenured player, understands the odds are probably against him. he is 35 and has not played in a major league game since may 2016. he has appeared in only 75 games since the start of the 2015 season.
our wildlife refuges are, by definition, public lands and waters set aside to conserve america's wild animals and plants, and few areas in the united states are as wild or as biologically rich as the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge.
who is the audience for these speeches?
analysts' assessments, based on recent statements by senior indian officials, are necessarily speculative. states with nuclear weapons often leave ambiguity in their doctrines to prevent adversaries from exploiting gaps in their proscriptions and to preserve flexibility. but signs of a strategic adjustment in india are mounting.
the company offers health care options to all employees, but has strained to square those costs with the scrambled politics of the affordable care act and the right retirement packages. over the last two years, independent financial advisers and banks have pitched cumbersome and overpriced retirement plans that do not suit mr. polyoka's designs for foodshed. the new law would allow foodshed to work around that kind of dead end by using state-appointed private money managers.
i think the term distracted is so loaded, said dr. jenny radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at the university of michigan at ann arbor, who is one of the authors of the american academy of pediatrics new policy statement on media use for children from birth to age 5. yes, she said, there are plenty of nonelectronic distractions out there. but the problem is, interactive technology and social media are designed to be emotionally absorbing and habit forming.
the city council soon took up a bill to place a two-year moratorium on condominium conversions. the bill, moved by city council speaker corey johnson at the union's behest, would have directly affected the new waldorf owners.
he was one of at least a dozen ukrainian political and business figures who made their way to washington for the inauguration, several of whom attended the liberty ball. most had more on their dance cards than just parties.
a heightened sense of accountability can also keep power in check. a study in social psychological and personality science found that making people feel powerful increased their clarity and compassion when they had to lay off an employee in a hypothetical situation, but only when they knew they had to explain their layoff approach to others.
the defections of former loyalists started earlier in the day. many advisers around the president were worried that his message in a video he posted on social media was not forceful enough and that some of his supporters would interpret it as encouragement to continue fighting for him. alyssa farah, who resigned last month from her post as the white house communications director, tweeted a more direct message to the president's supporters. dear maga- i am one of you. before i worked for @realdonaldtrump, i worked for @markmeadows & @jim_jordan & the @freedomcaucus, she wrote, establishing her conservative bona fides. i marched in the 2010 tea party rallies. i campaigned w/ trump & voted for him. but i need you to hear me: the election was not stolen. we lost.
what constituted clear direction? mr. schumer asked. did he get an order from the president, or did someone like mr. mulvaney get an order from the president passed on to mr. duffey? was there discussion among officials about covering up for the president in delay of military assistance? these are questions that can only be answered by examination of the documentary evidence and by the testimony of key trump administration officials under oath in a senate trial.

i do not consider what happened in kansas to be some run-of-the-mill shooting. no way. it was horrific. it had an ugly racial dimension and it turned into a major diplomatic incident. and i happen to share the reader's personal concern — i might have been a victim too if i had been in that bar at that time. but which label best applies to the crime is more a question for law enforcement than the times. was this a hate crime? was it terrorism? there are specific legal conditions that must be met for those labels to be applied. i can assure this concerned reader that we'll keep on top of this case and pass along all that we find.
my career never recovered and never will, said charlotte brock, 39, a mother in vienna, va. when she had her first child eight years ago, she quit her job as a think tank analyst and moved in with her parents because she had no paid leave.
if, in the end, the supreme court were to rule that emergency-power laws give mr. trump authority to proceed, he would probably face still more litigation with property owners over whether the government may use eminent domain to force them to sell their border lands. there may be little time left in his term after all that to add more than a few miles, if any, of barriers to the 1,954-mile border, which already has 654 miles of fencing.
now a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of american companies in the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.
it is, of course, impossible to sum up a year — this one, more than most. it was grim and it was sobering and it was, at its heart, unbelievable. any one of the major stories of the past 12 months would have riveted us. any one of them felt like the story of a lifetime. the coronavirus pandemic. the killing of george floyd and the protests and raw reckoning that followed. the wildfires that turned western skies red with fury and razed whole towns. a deeply divisive presidential election and the bitter efforts to undo it.
it is unclear how vulnerable mr. de blasio may be within his own party, or whether he is more likely to be challenged by a lone opponent or a throng of candidates. nonetheless, mr. stringer and mr. jeffries could represent starkly different threats to mr. de blasio.
in 2016, the mayor wanted the audience to be the general public. so he gave his speech in the evening, when more regular people could watch. they did the same thing last year and i guess they haven't gotten the eyeballs they wanted. this year, they're doing it at 11 a.m., a more web-friendly time.
clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon. the trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending, but those benefits are waning. and mr. trump's trade war with china is beginning to be felt by american companies, like apple and fedex, which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits.
i saw firsthand how the pandemic made immigrants more receptive to smartphone apps such as remitly and transferwise to send money back home. there may be no going back to more traditional remittance payments.
mr. luo is an unexpected choice to run the central liaison office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland china. he was also only a month into his latest job, in china's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to hong kong came together fast.
as canada tries to make amends for its brutal history of relations with its indigenous population, midwives and other members of the community in inukjuak, a town of around 1,800 people in a remote region of quebec, point to the clinic as an example of a way forward. today around three out of four pregnant women in the town give birth in its clinic, attended to by inuit midwives.
often lawyers involved in litigation will seek reporters out to tell a client's story in the hope that public attention will help win a case. that is not what happened here. by the time i met ms. bedolis and her client, they had abandoned plans for a lawsuit, and the statute of limitations on civil action had run out.
while mr. warnock's success was a major gain for his party — he is the first democrat to be elected to the senate from georgia since 2000 — both political parties remain on edge over the unresolved ossoff-perdue race and its implications for the next two years in american politics. whichever party wins that race will control the senate. after mr. biden's triumph in november, mr. warnock's victory provides yet another comeuppance for the trumpist politics that have come to define the republican party over the past four years. ms. loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. in recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with mr. trump in northwest georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to mr. biden when congress meets on wednesday. mr. warnock and mr. ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two republicans, with each pair often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. republicans used much of the runoff to focus on mr. warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize african-american voters, especially in more conservative rural georgia, where the church is a pillar of many communities. read more
he is running for office in a state where people in predominantly black neighborhoods waited in disproportionately long lines to vote last year, and where one study found that more than 80 percent of the residents hospitalized for coronavirus in the state were black — vestiges of systemic racism in the democratic and health care systems. political power in the former jim crow south, where few black americans have been elected to statewide office, is inextricably linked to race. and mr. warnock's place in the political universe is distinct from the election of vice president-elect kamala harris, or northerners like former president barack obama, previously a senator from illinois, and senator cory booker of new jersey. together, mr. warnock and mr. ossoff have the chance to expand mr. biden's legislative agenda. but mr. warnock alone was seeking to overcome a barrier reinforced in the south over and over again, crystallized in a saying that become popular during the civil rights movement: the south doesn't care how close a negro gets, just so he doesn't get too high. on tuesday, black democrats in georgia said such history was not lost on them. neither was how long it took the party to seriously pursue the possibility of success in georgia. it took democrats forever to invest in georgia, said frazier lively, a 71-year-old who lives in macon and attended a recent rally. now you would hope what's happening here is a message to what's possible going forward. read more
with previous versions of the virus, contact tracing suggested that about 10 percent of people who have close contact with an infected person — within six feet for at least 15 minutes — inhaled enough virus to become infected. with the variant, we might expect 15 percent of those, dr. bedford said. currently risky activities become more risky. scientists are still learning how the mutations have changed the virus. each infected person offers opportunities for the virus to mutate as it multiplies. with more than 83 million people infected worldwide, the coronavirus is amassing mutations faster than scientists expected at the start of the pandemic. the vast majority of mutations provide no advantage to the virus and die out. but mutations that improve the virus's fitness or transmissibility have a greater chance to catch on. at least one of the 17 new mutations in the variant contributes to its greater contagiousness. the mechanism is not yet known. some data suggest that the new variant may bind more tightly to a protein on the surface of human cells, allowing it to more readily infect them. muge cevik, an infectious disease expert at the university of st. andrews in scotland and a scientific adviser to the british government, said it's important to look at evidence as preliminary and accumulating. but one thing is for sure, mitigation efforts will need to remain a priority. we need to be much more careful over all, and look at the gaps in our mitigation measures, said dr. cevik said.
but health-share ministries have become particularly attractive to people like the collie family who don't qualify for a federal subsidy and can't afford an a.c.a. plan. even though premiums in the a.c.a. market have stabilized, critics of the law insist people need alternatives. that's the real driver behind the growth, said dr. dave weldon, a former republican congressman from florida who is president of the alliance of health care sharing ministries, which represents the two largest groups.
those who have won housing lotteries are a diverse group, from a variety of socioeconomic, racial and geographic backgrounds. despite their differences, however, they tend to have something in common: many have faced challenging life events, and nearly all insist that the key to winning the lottery is determination.

justice dept. backs off the prospect of charging trump for inciting a riot. officials from the office of michael r. sherwin, the u.s. attorney in washington, said no charges would be filed against anyone who made inflammatory comments at the rally where the president spoke. credit... pool photo by tasos katopodis the justice department on friday backed off on the prospect of pursuing charges against president trump for encouraging supporters two days earlier to march to the capitol, where hundreds of them stormed the building in an attack that left five dead, including a police officer. mr. trump has come under intense bipartisan condemnation for his incitement of the attackers, and at a news conference on thursday, michael r. sherwin, the u.s. attorney in washington, had refused to rule out the possibility of investigating him. but on friday, officials from mr. sherwin's office said that no charges would be filed against anyone who made inflammatory comments at the rally where the president spoke. don't expect any charges of that nature, said ken kohl, the acting principal assistant u.s. attorney and the deputy chief of the office's national security division. a justice department spokesman later reiterated that prosecutors have not charged anyone with insurrection or incitement and that their focus is on the events at the capitol. during the earlier rally on wednesday, other close allies to the president also exhorted the crowd to confront lawmakers, who met on wednesday at the capitol to certify president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s electoral college victory.
andrew wheeler, the head of the environmental protection agency, began the legal and regulatory process for curbing highway truck emissions of nitrogen dioxide, which has been linked to asthma and lung disease.
in the event of war, the president of the united states has unrestricted powers to use nuclear weapons first. concerns about the absence of checks and balances on the first use of nuclear weapons have spiked because of donald j. trump's bellicose temperament and shallow understanding of nuclear flash points. these concerns have led some on capitol hill to introduce legislation that would prohibit the president from launching a nuclear first strike without a declaration of war by congress.
mr. ossoff's victory comes at a moment when the nation's political leadership has been paralyzed by a pro-trump mob that stormed the capitol and halted the formal accepting of the electoral college results by congress. the day's extraordinary proceedings — rioting interrupting the peaceful transition of political power — crystallized the campaign the georgia democrats ran against their republican opponents, both of whom pledged to seek to overturn the results of the presidential election to keep mr. trump in office. the republicans' losses in a state that mr. biden narrowly carried in november, but that still leans right politically, also amounted to a vivid illustration of the perils of embracing mr. trump. he put his diminished political capital on the line with an election eve appearance in northwest georgia. and mr. perdue and ms. loeffler unwaveringly embraced the president throughout the runoff races even as he refused to acknowledge mr. biden's victory and brazenly demanded that georgia state officials overturn his loss in the state. the political fallout of mr. trump's tenure is now clear: his single term in the white house will conclude with republicans having lost the presidency, the house and the senate on his watch. mr. ossoff and mr. warnock won thanks to a frenetic get-out-the-vote push that began immediately after the november election, when no candidate in either race claimed the majority needed to avoid a runoff. driving turnout among liberals and black voters in the early-voting period, democrats built an insurmountable advantage going into election day.
first, mr. bush never was a strong student. his transcript at yale, leaked to the new yorker, shows that he was a solid c student. although a history major, he sampled widely in the social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving some of his best grades (the equivalent of a b+) in philosophy and anthropology. (the anthropology class, however, was taught by margaret mead that year and was enormously popular because she offered among the easiest grades at yale.)
in addition to mr. mulvaney, more advisers and administration officials quit in protest, bringing the 11th-hour resignations to more than a half dozen. former attorney general william p. barr, once one of the president's most important defenders until he resigned last month, said in a statement to the associated press that the president's actions were a betrayal of his office and supporters and that orchestrating a mob to pressure congress is inexcusable.
an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will also remain in place for the time being, mr. castex said. in 15 areas of france, that curfew has already been tightened to 6 p.m., and could be similarly restricted in the coming days in 10 new areas. mr. castex said he could not rule out new nationwide restrictions, but he added that schools would only close again if the situation became particularly dire. mr. castex also addressed a barrage of criticism over the government's sluggish vaccination rollout, acknowledging that it had started slower than in other countries but attributing the delay to france's initial focus on retirement and nursing homes. still, the government vowed to speed things up, promising that at least 1 million people would be vaccinated by the end of the month and announcing that all people older than 75 would be eligible for vaccinations starting jan. 18. we are doing everything to enable you to get vaccinated in good conditions, olivier véran, the health minister, said at the news conference, adding that vaccination centers would soon open around the country and that people would be able to go through a simplified sign-up procedure to get their shots. mr. véran also announced that french health authorities had approved administering the second pfizer vaccine shot up to six weeks after the first shot, instead of the recommended three-week interval.
in recent years abortion-rights supporters moved from using neutral language like autonomy and choice toward using positive, stigma-defying language. groups like planned parenthood now speak about abortion care. oprah profiled activists who urge people to #shoutyourabortion. billboards erected by abortion-rights supporters proudly say that abortion is a family value.

remote workers have staked out coffee shops for years, but small-business owners say their ranks are rising. in 2016, 43 percent of american employees spent some time working remotely, according to a gallup survey; the number who telecommute at least half the time has grown by 115 percent since 2005, said a report last year from flexjobs and global workplace analytics. add in the self-employed, and the crowd gets even bigger. and while some still embrace the home-and-pajama model, a large contingent hits the corner cafe.

while the iranian-backed attack on the united states embassy in baghdad seemed to be under control, it played to mr. trump's longtime worry that american diplomats and troops in the middle east are easy targets and his longtime position that the united states must pull back from the region.

mr. murdoch's publicists had previously indicated that he did not expect mr. trump to recapture the presidency, and another murdoch publication, the new york post, trumpeted president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory even as mr. trump refused to accept the results. the post, in its own unsigned editorial on thursday, stopped short of arguing that mr. trump should prematurely exit the white house, instead urging his aides to stay and stop the crazy. but given mr. murdoch's influence on his publications' political views, the journal's blunt words for mr. trump — who once craved mr. murdoch's approval — signal that the mogul is now looking ahead to the start of the biden presidency.
instead, the russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the american public for example by hosting black lives matter and blue lives matter protest events in the same city on the same day. the people who shows up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. likewise the groups of americans being fed partisan content was real even if those feeding them were not. the organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.

here's how the wealthy are trying to jump the line in the vaccine rollout. syringes containing the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine ready for use at st. joseph hospital in orange, calif. credit... jae c. hong/associated press edward goldberg's phone would not stop ringing. not only was the concierge doctor on manhattan's upper east side fielding calls from patients who went to st. bart's or aspen — the wisdom of public-health officials be damned — and came back with covid, he was hearing from healthy people too. they had an urgent desire for the coronavirus vaccine, and surely there was a way to gain access to it immediately. another contingent was calling dr. goldberg's office inquiring about membership in his practice, assuming that they would then be fast-tracked for the vaccine. concierge medicine involves the payment of annual fees — in dr. goldberg's case, $20,000 a year — for what is essentially unlimited access to a doctor's care. when asked how quickly someone might receive a vaccine, dr. goldberg explains that new york state is levying huge penalties against any medical outfit that tries to game the protocols for distribution. it was inevitable that in an era marked by inequity and radically conflicting interpretations of truth that the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine would be marked by so much delusion on multiple fronts.

in 1968, the insurgents carried the war to the towns and cities up and down the length and breadth of the country in the tet offensive. american and south vietnamese armed forces launched a furious counteroffensive, which inflicted additional destruction and casualties. another million people were estimated to be displaced during the tet offensive and another offensive in may 1968. the losses incurred by the viet cong during those counterattacks opened the way for the american and south vietnamese governments to push an accelerated pacification program. the few restraints that had been in place to prevent indiscriminate killing of civilians were lifted, and the extensive use of firepower in populated areas was applied with deadly results to drain the pond to catch the fish.

qualcomm's chief executive will retire in june. steve mollenkopf led qualcomm for nearly seven years. credit... guerin blask for the new york times qualcomm said its chief executive, steve mollenkopf, will retire in june after nearly seven years leading the big mobile chip maker through stiff legal and business challenges. mr. mollenkopf will be succeeded by cristiano amon, a qualcomm veteran who has been the public face of the company's effort to develop 5g wireless technology. mr. mollenkopf, 52, grappled with a hostile takeover attempt by broadcom that was blocked by the trump administration, an aborted $44 billion purchase of nxp semiconductors, and an adverse 2019 ruling in an antitrust suit brought by the federal trade commission. the ruling was overturned by an appeals court in august, and qualcomm's share price is up more than 40 percent since then. the company said it was mr. mollenkopf's decision to hand the top job to mr. amon, 50, who previously held the title of president. mr. amon helped push acquisitions that has allowed qualcomm to begin selling new categories of radio chips for smartphones.

more states are detecting the highly contagious virus variant. people who qualify under phase 1a or phase 1b of texas state guidelines were in line to receive covid-19 vaccinations on sunday, in houston. credit... yi-chin lee/houston chronicle, via associated press the list of states to identify the dangerous new coronavirus variant is growing. texas, connecticut and pennsylvania confirmed their first cases on thursday, joining california, colorado, georgia, florida and new york. florida has at least 22 confirmed cases, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. california has reported at least 26. experts have warned that the united states is woefully ill-equipped to track the rapidly transmissible variant. without a robust, national system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, states are left on their own to identify the variant. the texas department of health and human services said an adult male resident of harris county, which includes houston, with no history of travel tested positive for the coronavirus. genetic sequencing this week showed that the infection was caused by the variant. the fact that this person had no travel history suggests this variant is already circulating in texas, dr. john hellerstedt, the commissioner of state health services, said in a statement. it's not surprising that it showed up here given how rapidly it spreads. dr. hellerstedt urged texans to redouble our commitment to social distancing and public health measures. in connecticut, gov. ned lamont said two individuals between 15 and 25 years old had tested positive for the variant.

the hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. the wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the united states military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
has africa been spared? researchers say the numbers of cases and deaths are probably undercounted. the true toll of the virus across africa will probably never be known, partly because elevated mortality rates cannot be used as a measure the way they are elsewhere. credit... joao silva/the new york times lagos, nigeria — as the pandemic has swept across the world, it has become increasingly evident that in a vast majority of countries on the african continent, most deaths are never formally registered. reliable data on a country's deaths and their causes are hard to come by, which means governments can miss emerging health threats — whether ebola or the coronavirus — and often have to formulate health policy blindly. covid-19 has been said to have largely bypassed africa. but as with other diseases, the virus's true toll here will probably never be known, partly because elevated mortality rates cannot be used as a measure the way they are elsewhere. in other parts of the world, epidemics have been identified by unusual spikes in deaths compared with the mortality rate in a normal year. but many african governments are unable to do this, as they do not know the baseline mortality in their own countries. the mortality due to covid in the african continent is not a major public issue, said dorian job, the west africa program manager for doctors without borders.

a new study uses the world's largest collection of coronavirus genomes to map the pandemic's arrival in britain. a deserted covent garden on tuesday, the first day of england's third lockdown due to the coronavirus. credit... andrew testa for the new york times by the time britain imposed its first pandemic lockdown last march, more than 1,000 people had entered the country with the coronavirus and infected others, scientists reported on friday in the most detailed account to date of the virus's arrival and spread through a nation. other countries with high rates of international travel, like the united states, likely had similar numbers of introductions of the virus in the first months of the pandemic, the authors wrote. the researchers, based at the university of oxford and the university of edinburgh, analyzed more than 50,000 genomes compiled by the covid-19 genomics uk consortium, the largest such collection in the world. about 75 percent of the infected travelers who started chains of infection in the country during that early period came from spain, france, or italy; less than 1 percent came from china. the epidemic that those introductions created in britain last spring was one of the world's largest, consisting of more than 1,000 distinct infection chains, which scientists call lineages. lineages established early in the year were larger and more widely distributed than later arrivals, as well as harder to eliminate, the research team found.
a judge has blocked trump's sweeping restrictions on asylum applications. asylum seekers from honduras waiting in ciudad juarez, mexico, near the border city of el paso for a chance to apply for asylum in the united states last march. credit... daniel berehulak for the new york times a federal judge on friday blocked the trump administration from implementing a rule, set to take effect next week, that would have closed the doors of the united states to most asylum seekers. the sweeping clampdown on asylum would have prevented a large swath of people from qualifying for protection in the united states by narrowing eligibility. applicants who had not first sought asylum in a transit country through which they had passed; had lived in the united states for a year without permission or had claimed persecution based on sexual orientation would be disqualified. though president-elect joseph r. biden jr. could take action to reverse the policy once in office, it would take several months to undo it because it had already been finalized. judge james donato of the u.s. district court for northern california issued a nationwide injunction on procedural grounds, saying that the acting homeland security secretary, chad wolf, lacked authority to impose the rule because he had not been properly confirmed for his position. in his decision, judge donato pointed out that it was the fifth time that a court had ruled against the government on the same grounds.
some people in shijiazhuang said they had been instructed by their residential compounds to stay at home for 14 days, a week longer than the government requires. hebei's aggressive measures are part of an ongoing effort by the authorities to keep the number of new infections in china close to zero, particularly ahead of the lunar new year travel rush that is expected in february. health officials on saturday urged the public to reduce travel during the upcoming holiday — which, for tens of millions of migrant workers, is often their only chance of the year to return home from their jobs in distant cities. getting the current outbreak under control is especially important, officials say, given the region's proximity to beijing, which borders hebei. earlier this week, wang dongfeng, hebei's communist party secretary, pledged to make the province the moat to safeguard beijing's political security. amy qin and
the announcement that mr. biden intends to free up extra doses coincided with a letter from eight democratic governors — including andrew m. cuomo of new york and gretchen whitmer of michigan, both of whom have clashed with president trump — imploring the current administration to release all available doses to the states as soon as possible. the failure to distribute these doses to states who request them is unconscionable and unacceptable, the governors wrote in the letter, which was obtained by the new york times and sent friday to the secretary of health, alex m. azar ii, and gen. gustave f. perna, who is in charge of vaccine distribution. we demand that the federal government begin distributing these reserved doses to states immediately, the letter said. mr. biden's promise of 100 million shots in arms is an ambitious one, and the trump administration's rocky rollout — which mr. biden called a travesty on friday — has not made his task any easier. as of thursday, the trump administration had shipped more than 21 million vaccine doses, and millions more were already in the federal government's hands. yet only 5.9 million people had received a dose. state and local public health officials, already overwhelmed with rising infections, have been struggling to administer the vaccine to hospital workers and at-risk older americans while most people remain in the dark about when they might be protected.
mr. cuomo said he intended to include nearly $700 million in the state budget for the first phase of the project, which would involve the rare step of decommissioning the expressway, also known as interstate 895. that would be the first significant funding of a plan that community activists and some local elected officials have championed for more than 15 years.

second, the extremity of his rhetoric persuaded skeptics of mass immigration, long burned by politicians of both parties, that trump would not betray them. in a political landscape where every year seemed to bring a new bipartisan push for amnesties and immigration increases, his xenophobic style was an effective political marker for anyone with inchoate anxieties about immigration. you didn't have to literally believe that he would build the wall and make mexico pay for it to regard that wild promise as evidence that he would be more genuinely restrictionist and hawkish on the issue than politicians merely paying lip service to border security.

wherefore president trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy and the constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. president trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the united states, the document reads. speaker nancy pelosi threatened on friday that the house could move to impeach mr. trump over his role in inciting the attack on the capitol if he did not resign immediately. the threat in his final days in office raises political, constitutional and logistical questions rarely contemplated in american history: no president has ever been impeached twice or after already losing re-election. it is possible, but the timing is tight. nicholas fandos and

furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. it's structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. the solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.

i've long been puzzled by the seemingly arbitrary mention of the family background of subjects in times' obituaries. this is particularly striking in the case of people of jewish ancestry. two obituaries this week illustrate the point. here is alan colmes: mr. colmes, a brooklyn-born grandson of jewish immigrants from ukraine, worked in radio and as a stand-up comic before fox news recruited him. and here is kenneth arrow: kenneth joseph arrow was born on aug. 23, 1921, in new york city. there is no mention of arrow's parents, who were both romanian-jewish immigrants to the united states, a fact that is easily found and seems more relevant to his obituary than colmes' grandparents to his. there are many other examples of this kind of contrast. i wonder what the criteria are for including information about an obituary subject's religious background and ancestry. peter samson, mclean, va.

(mr. warnock finished ahead of his republican opponent, senator kelly loeffler, in washington county in november, but that race was so crowded with candidates that it's hard to directly compare it to the runoff.)

the storming of capitol hill was organized on social media. supporters of mr. trump breached the capitol rotunda. credit... saul loeb/agence france-presse — getty images just after 1 p.m., when president trump ended his speech to protesters in washington by calling for them to march on congress, hundreds of echoing calls to storm the building were made by his supporters online. on social media sites used by the far-right, such as gab and parler, directions on which streets to take to avoid the police and which tools to bring to help pry open doors were exchanged in comments. at least a dozen people posted about carrying guns into the halls of congress. calls for violence against members of congress and for pro-trump movements to retake the capitol building have been circulating online for months. bolstered by mr. trump, who has courted fringe movements like qanon and the proud boys, groups have openly organized on social media networks and recruited others to their cause. on wednesday, their online activism became real-world violence, leading to unprecedented scenes of mobs freely strolling through the halls of congress and uploading celebratory photographs of themselves, encouraging others to join them. on gab, they documented going into the offices of members of congress, including that of house speaker nancy pelosi. dozens posted about searching for vice president mike pence, who had been the target of mr. trump's ire earlier in the day.
the move to reverse course on mr. trump's promised swift withdrawal picked up in recent days, even as mr. bolton worked to avoid openly confronting the president the way mr. mattis did. on friday, in a briefing for reporters about a forthcoming trip to the middle east by secretary of state mike pompeo, a senior state department official said there was no fixed timetable for the american withdrawal.

moreover, trivia-based reporting is, in practice, deeply biased — not in a conventional partisan sense, but in its implicit assumption that a politician can't be serious unless he (and i mean he) is a conservative, or at most centrist, white male. that kind of bias, if it persists, will be a big problem for a democratic party that has never been more serious about policy, but has also never been more progressive and more diverse.

current law enforcement officials have not gone so far as to acknowledge mr. trump's role in encouraging the attack. the acting attorney general, jeffrey a. rosen, called the violence at the capitol an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy, and said that law enforcement officials were working to find, arrest and charge rioters. and the f.b.i. director, christopher a. wray, said that the bureau would pursue those involved in criminal activity during the mayhem. also on thursday, the head of the justice department's civil rights division, eric s. dreiband, told his staff that he was leaving the trump administration effective the following day. while many department leaders left after the election, his abrupt announcement took some people who worked for him by surprise. he did not cite a reason or say whether his departure was tied to mr. trump's conduct and the riots, but he quoted martin luther king jr. at length, saying: let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. let us stand with a greater determination. and let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be.

however, reconciliation bills must follow a set of complicated requirements known as the byrd rule. the simplest way of thinking about them is that legislative provisions have to be budgetary to be allowed. that means that the process isn't ideal for writing large-scale health reform, experts say, but it may be the best tool democrats have to pass laws with their slim majority.

americans' income from unemployment insurance benefits was 25 times higher from march through november 2020 than in the same period of 2019. that partly reflects that millions more jobless people were seeking benefits, of course. but it also reflects a $600 weekly supplement to jobless benefits that the act included through late july — along with a program to support freelance and contract workers who lost jobs and who otherwise would have been ineligible for benefits.

the islamic republic theocracy was the first time that a shia government had come to power in the middle east. the islamic faith is divided along sunnis and shias, and the division and rivalry go back all the way to the early days of islam and the succession of prophet muhammad. and shias have always been a minority in the faith. with saudi arabia sort of as the custodian of the sunni faith, iran has, for centuries, wanted to establish itself as the protector of the minority shias. and the theocracy of the islamic republic gave them the foundation and the structure to do that. and as soon as they had established their government in power in the country, they started looking externally. and general suleimani was pivotal in expanding the ambitions of iran's military and political apparatus in the middle east.

a study traces contagion on an 18-hour flight. a passenger wears multiple pieces of personal protective equipment for a flight last june. credit... mario tama/getty images a coronavirus outbreak aboard a september flight from dubai to new zealand offered researchers — and airlines — an opportunity to study in-transit contagion. after the 18-hour flight from dubai landed in auckland, local health authorities discovered evidence of an outbreak that most likely occurred during the trip. using seat maps and genetic analysis, the new study determined that one passenger initiated a chain of infection that spread to four others en route. previous research on apparent in-flight outbreaks focused on flights that occurred last spring, when few travelers wore masks, planes were running near capacity and the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. the new report, of a largely empty flight in the fall, details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware of and more cautious about the risks. the findings deliver a clear warning to both airlines and passengers, experts said. the key message here is that you have to have multiple layers of prevention — requiring testing before boarding, social distancing on the flight and masks, said dr. abraar karan, an internal medicine physician at brigham and women's hospital and harvard medical school who was not part of the study team. those things all went wrong in different ways on this flight, and if they'd just tested properly, this wouldn't have happened.

by 1972, the idea that vietnam posed a threat to cold war america was so discredited, it sometimes sounded as if america's only remaining war aim was to get back its p.o.w.s (president richard nixon bizarrely claimed that hanoi was using them as negotiating pawns). even more mind-boggling were nixon's historic 1972 trips to beijing and moscow. many americans wondered how nixon could offer toasts of peace to mao zedong and leonid brezhnev while still waging war in vietnam. as the journalist jonathan schell put it, if these great powers were not, after all, the true foe, then the war in vietnam really was a civil war in a small country, as its opponents had always said, and the united states had no business taking part in it.

ms. richards's dissension from the swelling chorus of #deletefacebook is notable and worth considering. in refusing to delete her facebook account, she is refusing to turn the power abuses of the tech industry into an issue of personal responsibility.
generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the u.s. government that guaranteed money for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory. above, at a new year's powwow in sault ste. marie, mich.
we need to do more. in addition to albany taxing all vehicles and providing strong incentives to vehicles that are transporting more people per square yard, there is complementary policy work to be done by the city of new york. it should increase the cost of on-street parking where personal cars lie immobile 95 percent of the time, obstructing flow. we must allocate more space to modes that provide more throughput of people (bike, bus and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes).
at a news conference after the december meeting, mr. powell emphasized that economic growth remained strong, and that the fed expected to continue raising rates in 2019. investors registered their disapproval by driving down asset prices, exacerbating a market slump.
what is the lagoon now used to be the football field on this island, mr. nizar said on a recent afternoon. i have to leave this guesthouse if it keeps eroding. i am sure of it.
achieving this outcome won't be easy. it will require honorable people who have served in the trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (at this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) it will require congressional republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. it will require democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help trump remain in office.
speaker nancy pelosi of california, whose party assumed control of the house this week, said democrats were committed to securing the border but wanted government offices reopened while they negotiated. we can do that best when government is open, she said.
the appointments further illustrate mr. biden's desire to surround himself with experienced and trusted former officials with whom he worked closely during the obama years, even as some democrats and foreign policy analysts complain that he has yet to infuse his national security team with fresh and more diverse faces bearing unconventional ideas.
shortly after he was elected, mr. trump said women might have to cross state lines to have an abortion because his goal was to see roe v. wade overturned. he graphically characterized hillary clinton as someone who would tolerate abortion up until the point a doctor could rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth. he also said at one point that he believed women who had abortions should be punished, a statement he later had to walk back after even anti-abortion groups said he had gone too far.
an explanation for readers who may not have followed my old blog: in my later years i have found myself, unexpectedly, a fan of indie music, and began running a regular feature i called friday night music, with performance videos by bands i like – sometimes ones i shot myself, sometimes pulled off others.
carter, who carried a .148 batting average to the plate with two outs in the eighth, hit a first-pitch changeup from the left-handed reliever felipe rivero into the yankees bullpen in left-center field — the deepest part of pnc park.
being here again makes me feel that i — an american citizen of iranian origin — have been here so often before. the cycles of imminent war and upheaval iranians seem destined to face every few years, cycles often driven by the whims of the united states and the increasing boldness of iran, now feel like a civilizational inheritance, a legacy that my mother bore before me, her mother before her, and that i will pass down to my children. every iranian family's history is touched with this past, in its own way.
to be clear, there are plenty of iranians who did not love or respect general suleimani. but there were activists, there were opposition figures who had been jailed by the regime who attended. and when i asked them, why are you there? why are you going? the response was, general suleimani protected our national security. he transcended politics. he was a national hero. and i was talking to some young people who had attended his funeral, and i spoke to a 22-year-old young man, a university student, and i asked him, why are you at the funeral? and he said, knowing general suleimani was out there made me feel safer. he was like a security umbrella above our country. and that's a sentiment that i heard over and over.
archived recording pollution's levels in some parts more than 17 times above hazardous levels, while major landmarks, including parliament house, are barely visible through the smoke.
and so these fires have created smog and smoke haze.
after four years of standing beside mr. trump, including some of his baseless claims of voter fraud, mr. graham made a clean break wednesday night after the mob had been cleared from the capitol, saying enough is enough. he seemed to foresee the coming crisis. i cannot convince people, certain groups, by my words, but i will tell you by my actions, he said in the senate. on friday, mr. graham could be seen in another video, posted by politico's daniel lippman, being escorted out of the waiting area by uniformed police officers as several dozen people harassed him. (an earlier version of this post misspelled mr. lippman's surname.) one day they will not be able to walk down the street, said one woman, wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the initial q, a reference to qanon, the pro-trump conspiracy theory. it is today. mindy robinson, a self-described conservative activist and commentator, posted yet another video in which a woman, apparently her, called mr. graham a garbage human being. it's going to be like this forever, wherever you go, for the rest of your life, the woman taunted.
iran's nuclear expansion would force the trump administration to either accept the risk that tehran acquires a nuclear weapons capability — an ironic outcome of leaving the allegedly bad nuclear deal — or it will have to conduct military strikes to prevent it and initiate the conflict it claims it wants to avoid.
flight bookings to the united states also declined following the ban, according to forwardkeys, a travel research company in valencia, spain. the company looked at 16 million flight reservations a day between jan. 28 and feb. 4 and found that international bookings to the united states were down 6.5 percent, compared with the same period last year.
he reiterated an untrue claim that mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement, and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants. above, mr. trump in mcallen, tex.
the choice of mr. liu to lead the delegation is somewhat surprising, and underscores his growing influence in the chinese government. wang qishan, the powerful leader of mr. xi's anticorruption campaign until his retirement from the politburo in october, is expected by many experts to be named the country's vice president during the annual session of china's congress, which is to begin on march 5.
our desktop and laptop computers are only a small portion of what we connect to the internet. we also have phones, televisions, video game consoles, smart speakers and more. if you're mildly technically inclined, you can track all of this too.
if herzl's and sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then judaism would not deserve to endure. if jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-semitism to keep us jewish--then jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. we have been persecuted long enough. the time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. we must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual jews will mean the failure of judaism.
the cause was a heart attack, a niece, doris a. kressly, said.
borrowing costs: the fed increased its target rate four times in 2018, and fears that the central bank would raise interest rates too much and send a chill through the american economy weighed heavily on stocks in 2018. if investors don't see signs that the economy is growing steadily, they could hang on the fed's every move, and monetary policy meeting, this year.
the core principle behind the rule of law is that justice is blind and partisan identity should not influence a trial's outcome. but anyone watching mr. mcconnell twist himself into knots in trying to block witnesses and documents has to wonder whether this notion ever took root in his mind. he has gone so far as to say that there will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this to the extent that we can. he also said, there's no chance the president is going to be removed from office.
it would be a home run if we got to 60 to 65 percent self-sufficiency for the afghan air force, said a retired general who commanded the air training mission in 2013 and 2014.
a budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the house, and could be rejected by senate republicans as well. mr. trump's proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. their failure could have practical implications for the white house.
2. this is not a bush fire. it's an atomic bomb.
by decreasing the extent to which people use e-cigarettes, you decrease quitting of conventional cigarettes, said w. kip viscusi, a professor of law, economics and management at vanderbilt university, who was not involved in the research but has studied tobacco policy extensively.
the results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
the story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the holocaust. another great eastern european rabbi, elchanan wasserman--the dean of the rabbinical college in baranowitz, poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to yeshiva college in new york or to the beis medrish letorah in chicago, both distinguished orthodox rabbinical colleges. he declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. the great rabbi reasoned, what would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? rabbi wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in poland, where they were murdered by the nazis.
at any rate, mr. trump continued, we've already built a lot of the wall and renovated a tremendous amount of wall. (the trump administration has replaced some existing barriers with new barriers, and will begin constructing 14 miles of new wall in february. but to date, construction on his border wall has not started.)
unable to make any legislative progress on this front, roosevelt resorted to other tactics. he issued dozens of executive orders creating federal wildlife refuges on public land, a move that protected animals and reduced pollution. he also made liberal use of presidential commissions. the inland waterways commission was established in 1907 to manage the nation's lakes and rivers and to develop their potential as a transportation network. the ostensible goals were economic, but the plan also called for flood control, soil reclamation and pollution abatement — all boons to public health.
but critics, including mr. trump, have said the economy still needs the fed's help. inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.
toronto — the milwaukee bucks are one loss away from elimination. the n.b.a. playoffs do not slow down for any team, not even for one as precocious as the bucks. it could all come to an end for them against the toronto raptors on thursday in game 6 of their first-round playoff series. but even if the bucks lose, it will still feel as if they are just getting started.
new york will start allowing essential workers and those over 75 to get a vaccine. video transcript back bars 0:00 / 1:39 - 0:00 transcript n.y. will begin allowing essential workers and elderly to get vaccine gov. andrew m. cuomo said new yorkers 75 and older and some essential workers, like teachers, police and public transit employees, will be able to schedule covid-19 vaccinations starting monday. we're going to accelerate the distribution. and what we're going to do is add new distribution networks to supplement the hospitals. on monday, they will begin accepting reservations for vaccinations. i'll discuss in a moment. this is a very large group of people. and it can't just be show up at the pharmacy. it's going to be, much the way it was with covid testing, go to a website, find out the location nearest you, make a reservation. the network will distribute to 1a and 1b. the new providers must prioritize their health care staff. 1b is a very large group, 3.2 million new yorkers, in 1b — 1b, 870,000 teachers, 200,000 police and firefighters, 100,000 public safety workers, correction officers, etc. ; 100,000 public transit workers, 1.4 million 75-year-olds. to finish 1a, we need one million doses. 1b, we need 3.2 million doses. put 1a and 1b together, you need 4.2 million doses. we get 300,000 doses per week. at this rate, it will take us 14 weeks to do 1a and 1b — 14 weeks. gov.
several professors who taught him said he had simply been one student in a huge class. as the historian john morton blum put it, i haven't the foggiest recollection of him. erich segal, who later met mr. gore at harvard and based the main character in love story partly on him, taught a classical comedy course that mr. bush took, but mr. segal said he had no memory of him.
could he reach a compromise with democrats to end the shutdown by coupling wall funding with a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as dreamers? mr. trump responded that democrats lost interest as soon as the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld an injunction against his administration's termination of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program. (a deal on the program and to avoid an earlier government shutdown in early 2018 faltered last january, after mr. trump made vulgar remarks on immigration. the court ruled on the case in november.)
that's because the president has the power to issue pardons — but not to secretly offer them in exchange for silence, argues asha rangappa, a former f.b.i. special agent. even the immense powers of the president can't be used as a bargaining chip.
washington — the pentagon has abruptly sent the aircraft carrier nimitz home from the middle east and africa over the objections of top military advisers, marking a reversal of a weekslong muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring iran from attacking american troops and diplomats in the persian gulf.
we'll be right back. so livia, you said that the work of fighting these enormous fires has really fallen on individuals like susie, and that there's a sense that the government isn't doing enough. so what exactly has the government been doing?
the incidence of new coronavirus cases was generally declining in early august, the researchers said, though rates among adults aged 18 to 22 were on the rise. infection rates went on falling — by an average of 18 percent — where large universities chose to teach remotely, the researchers found, but the rates shot up where in-person instruction was underway. the researchers did not take account of whether students were physically present on campus, even if classes were being held remotely, dr. lisa barrios, a member of the c.d.c. 's covid-19 response team, pointed out. as a result, she said, it was hard to know whether the large decreases in remote-learning counties happened because fewer students were physically present, or because the universities did other things as well, like impose rigorous mask mandates and bans on social gatherings. the study also compared counties with large universities teaching in person against counties less than 500 miles away with about the same total population but no large university, and found similarly sharp differences in virus incidence: an 80 percent rise in the university counties, versus a drop of nearly 20 percent in the others. dr. barrios urged universities to increase testing when students return to campus and make adequate provisions to isolate and quarantine infected and exposed students. students and staff members who catch the virus may increase the risks to people off campus, particularly those who are older or have underlying health problems. most universities don't exist in a bubble, dr. barrios said.
in the 1930s, he shifted toward a long-term approach of buying stocks with good long-term potential and holding them indefinitely, what mr. chambers calls essentially a warren buffett type of approach. his returns improved.
how many of these speeches has mayor de blasio given?
from these grade-school negotiations mr. silverbush acquired some valuable information. i knew from second grade that i wanted to be a lawyer, he said.

monday morning was the start of the official state funeral for general qassim suleimani.
to those who say that jewish education is the key to jewish survival, i say, you are undoubtedly right. whatever the essence or essences of judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. but we cannot count on all jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become jewishly educated, especially since jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the american jewish community.

it's not just health insurance coverage, though, that ensures a person's freedom. it's difficult to pursue one's dreams on an empty stomach. how do you start a business without being able to afford rent?
the move is the latest salvo in two years of public complaints by good government advocates over the groups, run by close allies of the mayor, that grew out of mr. de blasio's 2013 campaign. they have since advocated for his policies, beginning with the push for universal prekindergarten and, now, the battle over rezoning and affordable housing.
the highway protest in minneapolis came months after city police officers killed george floyd, sparking widespread protests and calls for an end to systemic racism. amid chaotic demonstrations in the days following the killing, the police retreated from a police precinct headquarters, allowing protesters to descend on it and burn it down.
unsurprisingly, such problems lead to ever more disquieting outcomes.
but uncertainties have piled up in recent months. the minutes said investors were particularly concerned about trade tensions between the united states and china, and about global growth.
london —according to washington despatches, china has officially announced that she has severed diplomatic relations with germany.
now, as the clock runs down on president trump's time in office, the climate assessment has gained a new distinction: it is one of the few major u.s. climate initiatives that his administration tried, yet largely failed, to undermine.
to all appearances, little may have changed on jan. 1, the country's first day outside the european union's single market and customs union. it was, after all, a public holiday and not much business was taking place.
for one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. new developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the technological valley of death, in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the commercialization valley of death, in which an effective technology can't get to market. government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy — from nuclear energy, to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar — through these troughs.
they told themselves that the storm — the day of reckoning, in qanon lore, when the global cabal would be brought to justice — would take place on march 4. that is the day that u.s. presidents were inaugurated until 1933, when the 20th amendment was ratified and the date was moved to january. some qanon believers thought that it would be the day that mr. trump would make a triumphal return as the nation's legitimate president, based on their false interpretation of an obscure 19th century law.
1. the shutdown won't end soon.
when iranian operatives blew holes in oil tankers in the gulf of oman in june and launched drone strikes on saudi oil facilities in september, mr. trump opted in both cases against a direct, immediate military response. still, one day after the drone strike targeting general suleimani, the pentagon announced it was sending around 3,000 more troops to kuwait as a precaution against growing threats to american forces in the region.
in a long interview about his past, mr. bush quickly became edgy when he was asked about the internal motivations and pressures that have driven him over the years.
along with finding out that both her children had a mutation of the mthfr gene, she also received 23andme's analysis of her children's genetic susceptibility to a number of adult-onset diseases, including parkinson's. ms. evans shared the results with her children, family members and friends.

this country's war on drugs was intended to be a system of social control. yet the war on drugs has instead become a system of social chaos. american citizens, including drug users, have rights. my rights were violated numerous times during my child welfare case, and my family was wrongfully torn apart. when families are wrongfully torn apart, the results are devastating. when the fundamental relationship of every human being — the relationship of a child with his or her mother — is severed, the effects can be irreversible.
in november, the state issued a catastrophic fire danger rating for the first time in the decade that the current warning system has been in place.
washington — the top senate republican said on friday that the administration would brief all senators next week on the united states drone strike ordered by president trump that killed iran's top security commander.
yes, there will be more immigrants in the united states with mr. biden in the white house. under mr. trump, annual net immigration fell to just 595,000 people, the fewest since the 1980s, according to the brookings institution. in the two years immediately preceding the trump presidency, the united states saw net immigration of more than one million people annually.
mr. dudley noted, however, that the company would have to focus on discipline. bp had cut costs as lower oil prices ate into its profit. they have since risen from below $30 a barrel in 2016 to nearer $50 a barrel.
the public supports him not just because of his many achievements as prime minister but also because the alternatives don't seem better: another young, inexperienced leader? another novice who will lose his coalition within two years? another political amateur who will learn on the job? do we really need another 1996 model of mr. netanyahu when we have the smarter, more powerful, 2018 model?
mr. netanyahu announced the deal to great fanfare on monday, only to suspend it a few hours later. on tuesday, he canceled it completely and defended his abrupt reversal, saying he was responding to an outcry from members of his conservative likud party as well as partners in his governing coalition who routinely refer to the migrants as infiltrators and want all of them expelled.
my grandfather was adamant that the range, including the coastal plain, be protected in its entirety. as his interior secretary, fred seaton, explained to congress, looking ahead 50 years to the unfolding story of alaska's development, it is clear that the only economically feasible opportunity for maintaining a wilderness frontier large enough to protect the area's wildlife lies in this northeastern arctic region of the state.
merely shifting leaders' focus to the experiences of others can lead them to use power in more thoughtful ways. in a forthcoming study in the british journal of social psychology, researchers had undergraduates write about something that had happened to them or to someone they knew. then the students evaluated their peers in a product-naming task, and some of them were given the power to help determine a winner. the researchers found that people with that power were more concerned about the peers they were evaluating than were those without it — but only if they'd first been asked to recount another's experience.
on the hong kong flight, the analysis suggested that two passengers who boarded in boston infected two flight attendants. on the hanoi flight, researchers found that 12 of 16 people who later tested positive were sitting in business class, and that proximity to the infectious person strongly predicted infection risk.
never in the history of argentina have we had as many important people detained, the justice minister, germán garavano, said in an interview. the question we have to ask ourselves as we look to the future is whether this represents a change, a profound reform or merely a reaction to a public outcry right now. we'll get that answer in a few years.

what makes them unique is how much they're punching above their weight, said councilman rory lancman of queens, who lost a queens congressional race in 2012 to a hotel trades council-backed candidate, in an early demonstration of their electoral influence.
general suleimani was indisputably an enemy of the american people, a critical instrument of the iranian theocracy's influence across the middle east and an architect of international terrorism responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans and a great many others in the region, from yemen to syria. he no doubt had a role in the campaign of provocations by shiite militias against american forces in iraq that recently led to the death of an american defense contractor and a retaliatory american airstrike against the militia responsible for the attack.
lindsay p. cohn, a professor of political science at the naval war college, said that mr. trump appears to be convinced that general suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the middle east. it satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.
responsible travel, a tour operator in brighton, england, had a 22 percent decrease in trip inquiries to the united states following the travel ban. in contrast, the company's overall business is up 30 percent this year, compared with the same period last year, said its chief executive, justin francis.
washington — the federal budget deficit continued to rise in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and is on pace to top $1 trillion for the year, as president trump's signature tax cuts continue to reduce corporate tax revenue, data released tuesday shows.
spitballing here, but it may be that telling voters that you intend to ignore their verdict and overturn their votes from the november election was not a great closing argument for @kloeffler, mr. klain wrote shortly before 11 p.m. spitballing here, but it may be that telling voters that you intend to ignore their verdict and overturn their votes from the november election was not a great closing argument for @kloeffler — ronald klain (@ronaldklain) january 6, 2021 the new york times's needle is showing that mr. warnock is very likely to defeat ms. loeffler. should mr. warnock and jon ossoff, the other democrat running, both win their races, democrats would take control of the senate, with vice president-elect kamala harris serving as the chamber's tiebreaking vote. read more
is there anyone like warren on the other side of the aisle? no. not only aren't there any g.o.p. politicians with comparable intellectual heft, there aren't even halfway competent intellectuals with any influence in the party. the g.o.p. doesn't want people who think hard and look at evidence; it wants people like, say, the economist stephen moore, who slavishly reaffirm the party's dogma, even if they can't get basic facts straight.
mr. xi's speech was a sharp reminder that, even amid many other external disputes, chinese leaders remain preoccupied with taiwan, especially their concern that the island could defy their demands and embrace formal independence.
mr. bush was a rabble-rouser of sorts, but only in the high-spirited way that fraternity boys a generation earlier had swallowed goldfish or sat on flagpoles. for all the buffeting that late-night television has given mr. bush over questions of drug use, he was in most respects a very conventional young man, and classmates say they do not recall him ever using marijuana or other illegal drugs.
they were carrying the red flag of shia islam, which is a call to battle. they were chanting, no to negotiations, no to a deal, only war with the united states.
on the same day that georgia elected mr. ossoff, a 33-year-old jewish documentary filmmaker, and mr. warnock, a 51-year-old pastor who will become the state's first black senator, an almost entirely white crowd of aggrieved trump supporters, some carrying confederate flags, descended on washington to defy political reality.
the actions we saw in both washington, d.c. and olympia earlier this week were completely unacceptable and will not be repeated in our state capital again, mr. inslee said.
if you earn enough to save on top of your retirement plan but not so much that you are capped by i.r.s. income limitations, contribute to a roth i.r.a. the adjusted gross income phaseout range for roth i.r.a. contributions in 2017 is $186,000 to $196,000 for married couples filing jointly and $118,000 to $133,000 for singles and heads of households.
the prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last october along the united states border near san diego. the petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, maga (the acronym recalls the president's campaign slogan, make america great again), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the antiquities act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as a major land art exhibition of significant cultural value.
this is not because mr. castro, a former san antonio mayor best known nationally for being a housing secretary in the obama administration, has a large base of voters to throw anyone's way — if he did, he wouldn't have been dropped from the last two democratic debates. nor is it because he has a big roster of donors to pass on to the candidate who wins his backing.
and for that matter, may i call as my witness abraham lincoln, who is reported to have walked up and down the street in springfield, ill., in the mid-1800s, pulling his young sons in a wagon while reading a book (and as the story goes, he went right on reading when a child fell out of the wagon).
hong kong's ban on birth partners had been in place off and on for most of last year, and was most recently reintroduced over a month ago amid a fourth wave of infections. it went against a recommendation by the world health organization that all pregnant women, including those suspected or confirmed to have the coronavirus, have access to the companion of their choice during labor and childbirth. experts have also warned against such restrictions in the british medical journal and elsewhere. i still feel robbed, said emma whetnall, whose husband was not allowed to be present for the birth of their first child last may. i feel like that experience was stolen from us. the pandemic has complicated pregnancy and childbirth for women around the world, with many reporting negative experiences including nonconsensual procedures and forced separation from newborns. researchers have estimated that pandemic-related disruptions could result in tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths. hong kong was among the only places in the world where hospital restrictions still extended even to the delivery room. in march, gov. andrew cuomo of new york issued an executive order requiring all hospitals in the state to allow birth partners in delivery rooms after they were barred by two major hospital systems in new york city.
mr. obama adamantly supported a two-state solution, asserting america's unbreakable bond with israel while condemning israeli policies that he said had undermined efforts to resolve one of the world's most protracted conflicts.

re unfairly squeezing student borrowers (editorial, feb. 5):
in june 2009, thousands of protesters took to iran's streets to dispute the election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad and called for more political freedom, clashing with riot police officers. president barack obama's response was muted, but he did speak about the green movement, or green revolution.

senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina and a longtime ally of president trump, also denounced the storming of the capitol building, demanding criminal prosecution for those who participated, and praised president-elect joseph r. biden jr. for addressing the violence. i could not agree more with president-elect biden's statement to the nation. time to retake the capitol, end the violence, & stop the madness, mr. graham said on twitter. republican members of the house who did not sign on to efforts to dispute the results of the election also vocally criticized the efforts. we are witnessing absolute banana republic crap in the united states capitol right now. representative mike gallagher, republican of wisconsin, said in a video recorded in his congressional office, where he was sheltering in place. this is the cost of countenancing an effort by congress to overturn the election. just days into his first term in congress, representative peter meijer, republican of michigan, denounced mr. trump after he posted a video in which he advised members of his mob to go home but also spoke in sympathetic and affectionate terms enough. acknowledge biden as president-elect and end this madness, mr. meijer wrote on twitter. violent rioters laid siege to the nation's capitol in an act of insurrection unparalleled in modern times. this is not leadership.
mr. johnson followed on monday evening to announce the lockdown in england that many had predicted was inevitable.
all of this is in opposition to mr. ryan's ideas. he rose to prominence by releasing a series of budget blueprints that proposed slashing government spending by trillions of dollars. and in every single one, about two-thirds of those cuts are visited upon the things that already help people with limited means survive, such as food stamps, pell grants for education and programs that boost their incomes.
in many ways, general suleimani's story begins with the story of iran's revolution in 1979.
no one wants soiled or limp bank notes, says peter balke, a senior policy adviser for de nederlandsche bank, the central bank of the netherlands. balke's work has nothing to do with money laundering, which is the bailiwick of law enforcement; for much of the last decade, he has studied how cash gets dirty and methods for keeping it cleaner. globally, governments spend nearly $10 billion annually replacing grimy or crumpled cash (some half a billion euros are shredded each month for this reason). after balke published research finding that people's waxy skin oils are mainly to blame, he and his colleagues began investigating what could be done about it. to clean money, he says, you need to remove that built-up sebum.
republicans have also divided over supporting the president's determination to make one last and futile attempt to overturn the 2020 election results in congress next week.
most universities are in the same boat. today just 40 percent of college students earn a degree in four years. this phenomenon is so common that educators now use six years, by which time 59 percent of undergraduates receive their diplomas, as the new normal.
trump openly condones supporters who violently stormed the capitol, prompting twitter to lock his account. we will never concede, president trump said at a rally in front of the white house on wednesday. credit... pete marovich for the new york times president trump on wednesday evening openly condoned on social media the violence unfolding at the other end of pennsylvania avenue after a mob of his supporters stormed the capitol, prompting facebook and twitter to remove his posts and lock his accounts. these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, mr. trump tweeted wednesday evening, after spending much of the afternoon in the oval office watching footage of escalating violence unfolding on capitol hill. go home with love & in peace. remember this day forever! the tweet that appeared to prop up violent protesters as patriots and asserted baseless claims about the election outcome came after the president, under public and private pressure from advisers, had offered only a tepid response as the capitol was breached for the first time in modern history and one woman died after being shot on the capitol grounds. mr. trump posted the message on both his twitter and facebook accounts. facebook removed the post.

what does suleimani's meaning to people in iran — what does that mean for the response we should expect from the government there?
the extent to which mr. trump is willing to go in that effort became fully apparent on saturday, when he called brad raffensperger, georgia's republican secretary of state and a republican, urging him to find votes and recalculate the results of the state's presidential contest in his favor, ignoring the official finding, already certified by the governor, that he had lost. it was the culmination of efforts to overturn the election that began nearly two months ago. at every turn, mr. raffensperger and other georgia election officials have debunked the conspiracy theories about voter fraud pushed by the president and his allies. nonetheless, mr. trump renewed his attacks again tuesday night, baselessly claiming in a tweet that a a big 'voter dump' against the republican candidates was forthcoming. the short-term effect of mr. trump's pressure campaign will become evident as the votes are counted in the runoffs pitting david perdue and kelly loeffler, the two republicans fighting to keep their senate seats, against two democrats, jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock. for republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that mr. trump's effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout in the runoffs, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself is rigged and cannot be trusted. bill crane, a georgia political operative and commentator, said the president's tactics, as well as the work of activists in the state who have claimed the general election was rigged, were tamping down republican turnout.
he went on to say, in an absent-minded way the united states in vietnam may well have stumbled upon the answer to the insurgency. the answer lies in forced-draft urbanization and modernization, which would drive the rural population from the villages into urban areas and deprive the insurgency the support it needed to generate enough strength to come to power.
so the assassination of the iranian commander in an american drone strike in baghdad early friday was greeted with satisfaction in israel, though also with a degree of caution as the country went on alert for possible retaliation.

while mr. bolton said on sunday that he expected american forces to eventually leave northeastern syria, where most of the 2,000 troops in the country are based for the mission against the islamic state, he began to lay out an argument for keeping some troops at a garrison in the southeast that is used to monitor the flow of iranian arms and soldiers. in september, three months before mr. trump's announcement, mr. bolton had declared that the united states would remain in syria as long as iranians were on the ground there.
mr. horton is quick to acknowledge that there are many reasons his experiment might not capture employer behavior in the wider economy. but he says a higher minimum wage could attract more highly skilled workers who were not previously in the labor market — say, college students. at the same time, less-skilled workers might lose their jobs and drop out of the labor force.

libya: the european union's foreign policy chief, along with the foreign ministers of britain, germany, france and italy, on tuesday condemned continuing outside interference in the libyan conflict. the statement came a day after libyan rebels swept into the key coastal city of surt, and during a week in which turkey is dispatching troops to the country.
a chorus of criticism inevitably greeted mr. trump's recent statement that iranian forces can do what they want in syria. yet read as a statement of fact rather than the extension of a green light, he stumbled upon a self-evident truth: notwithstanding israel's successful efforts to limit iran's importation of advanced weaponry into syria, tehran's position in the country is essentially secure.

for a leading presidential candidate, mr. bush has an unusually testy relationship with the eastern establishment, although he also has an intimate history with it. his grandparents on both sides were card-carrying members of that establishment, yet ever since he showed up at yale as a freshman in 1964, mr. bush has resolutely cultivated an anti-intellectualism and chafed at what he describes as the arrogance of liberal intellectual elitists.

and prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. it's easier to build in phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in san francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). but while building in the san francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. by the paper's calculations, a home in the san francisco area should cost around $281,000.
enough of the hate. enough of the total dysfunction. just, enough. representative steve stivers, republican of ohio, said that he also supported stripping mr. trump of his powers through the 25th amendment. he did not rule out supporting impeachment but argued that congress could not remove the president through the impeachment process in the time remaining in mr. trump's term. the cabinet decides on the 25th amendment, and if the cabinet decided to do that, i would not oppose it, mr. stivers, a former chairman of the house republican campaign arm, said in a television appearance. i do not believe that an impeachment can happen in 13 days.
in practical terms, cambridge analytica is a total non-event. they were snake oil salespeople. the tools they used didn't work, and the scale they used them at wasn't meaningful. every claim they have made about themselves is garbage. data of the kind they had isn't that valuable to being with and worse it degrades quickly, so much so as to be effectively useless in 12-18 months. in fact the united kingdom information commissioner's office (ico) seized all the equipment at cambridge analytica and found that there was zero data from any uk citizens! so surely, this is one where we can ignore the press, right? nope. the platform was such a poor move that the risks associated were bound to come to light. that we shut it down in 2014 and never paid the piper on how bad it was makes this scrutiny justified in my opinion, even if it is narrowly misguided.
brussels — the trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the european union's delegation to the united states last year without making a formal announcement or informing the bloc about the change, a european official said on tuesday.
some iranian officials have called the killing of general suleimani — whose role in iran has been likened to that of an american vice president, chairman of the joint chiefs and c.i.a. director rolled into one — an act of war. but if it was, it took place without any of the public discussion in the united states that preceded actions like the 2003 american invasion of iraq.

it has been a remarkable turnaround for a man who spent much of his life as a supporter of abortion rights and who once described himself as very pro-choice. yet during the campaign, mr. trump spoke more vividly and more forcefully on the issue than any recent republican nominee, disregarding years of established practice from conservatives who believed that it was political suicide to sound too radical.

world leaders all know that trump is sort of crazy, but it's the extremity of his actions, the lengths to which he has gone, that he got 74 million votes and is not retiring but will be a force for the republicans that is disconcerting, he added. people knew what trump is like, but the importance is the shadow of the future.
mr. cuomo also called on local health departments to work with police, fire and teachers unions to vaccinate those workers. image credit... frank franklin ii/associated press earlier in the week, mr. de blasio had announced a plan to vaccinate thousands of police and corrections workers this weekend, but mr. cuomo halted the effort saying those workers were not yet eligible. all around the state, people are asking for the freedom to vaccinate, mr. de blasio said at a news conference. we have to assume at some point the state is going to hear us. mr. de blasio also said that the city planned to set up vaccine sites for workers who qualified for the next phase of inoculation. those sites would be ready on monday, mr. de blasio said. in neighboring new jersey, gov. philip d. murphy said on friday that his state would begin inoculating law enforcement and fire professionals. on friday, president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s transition team said he plans to release nearly all available coronavirus vaccine doses to help speed up distribution, which has been slow across the country. the announcement coincided with a letter from eight democratic governors — including mr. cuomo and gretchen whitmer of michigan, both of whom have clashed with president trump — imploring the current administration to release all available doses to the states as soon as possible.

on friday, much of the democratic field proceeded with — and recommended — caution. senator amy klobuchar of minnesota called on the trump administration to consult with congress about a strategy for preventing a wider conflict. and in north conway, n.h., pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, ind., called the baghdad attack an extremely provocative act, noting that presidents barack obama and george w. bush had both considered but opted against attempting to kill general suleimani.

i don't think there's any question ms. pelosi picked a hot pink dress for her swearing-in both because she knew it would make her stand out in what was still a room full of dark suits, and because of the symbolic nature of the occasion: a color traditionally associated with delicate femininity had become a color associated with a seat of power. that's a strategic and savvy choice, and to take notice of it is to acknowledge the multidimensional chess game ms. pelosi is playing, not to demean her.

congress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the affordable care act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. one priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help. another is rewriting formulas to peg the size of the subsidy to a more generous health insurance plan, a way to increase the amount of assistance.

how businesses are being linked with this gambit. the senators rejecting the election count include steve daines of montana, bill hagerty of tennessee, cynthia lummis of wyoming and roger marshall of kansas, who ran and won their seats in 2020. their major campaign contributors included corporate political action committees, which collect and distribute employee contributions, based on data from the center for responsive politics. here are some examples:

analysts also say the drone strike on general suleimani in iraq may well worsen an already tumultuous political environment in that country. the killing has already sent ripples including calls from the iraqi parliament and government for the united states to withdraw its troops. those in turn drew threats of sanctions from president trump.
once while on a train to new york city from new haven, he told a buddy, james lockhart, that he had done a lot of partying in his freshman year but that he now wanted to buckle down. as mr. lockhart remembers the conversation, mr. bush said, very seriously: i want to do more. i want to make a mark here.
taiwan will not be like one of those places, he suggested, that eased lockdowns under public pressure only to have to tighten them again later. taiwan has already held fast to its entry restrictions and quarantines for much longer than many governments could without facing a big public backlash. the island's economy has slowed along with the world's during the pandemic but it continues to grow at a decent clip. it's remarkable that taiwan has held the line for so long, said c. jason wang, an associate professor at stanford university school of medicine. but even if the island vaccinates its population by the middle of 2021, then you've still got six months to go, he said. it's really difficult to keep this up for another six months. currently, taiwan expects to begin receiving vaccine doses as early as march. we came up with many of our policies when there were a few million infections around the world, said chan chang-chuan, a professor at the college of public health at national taiwan university. but now there are tens of millions, and we're heading toward a hundred million. it's a whole different stage.

the people who didn't want television networks to cede a prime-time hour last night — or, as it turned out, a prime-time 10 minutes — to the president of the united states were implicitly giving donald trump a credit that he does not deserve. there is a kind of silver-tongued orator who can persuade in any situation, who like caesar's mark antony can find a crowd leaning one way and leave them stirred up for the opposite cause, who is legitimately dangerous when given a rostrum or a soapbox or a prime-time speech. but that is not our president: his rhetoric is a bludgeon, and what we saw last night was just an attempt to club his enemies and critics with the same arguments he's made a thousand times before.
the challenge is to move the jewish state of mind beyond its past obsession with victimization, pain, and problems and point it in a new, more positive direction, capable of thriving in an open society. for unless we do, we may become the generation that witnesses the beginning of the end of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of our planet--a unique source of so much goodness, compassion, morality, creativity, and intelligence over the past several millennia. the demise of jewish life as we have come to know it would be a tragedy not only for the jewish people collectively, but also for most of us individually--and for the world at large.

countries are unsure whether to take his words as policy pronouncements, or whether they can be safely ignored. if mr. trump's threats are seen as hollow, what does that do to american credibility? in a series of twitter posts on saturday, mr. trump reacted to questions about his mental fitness by calling himself a very stable genius.
mr. biden has promised to reinvigorate the federal occupational safety and health administration — part of the labor department — which has been criticized for failing to protect workers during the pandemic, including through lax oversight of workplaces like meatpacking plants. and he has pledged to provide more economic aid to small businesses, particularly those run by black, hispanic, asian and native american owners.

for a man like george w., who complains about elitism, skull and bones was an odd group to enter. it was the epitome of exclusivity, carefully choosing its members each year to undergo an elaborate initiation procedure in a windowless tomb that only members are allowed to enter, and the club was then being denounced as elitist by students and even by dean georges may. at least one classmate, jacques r. leslie jr., turned it down that year, just as president brewster had when he was an undergraduate.

mr. xi indicated that china's multipronged pressure on taiwan is likely to persist after ms. tsai's democratic progressive party, which is wary of moving closer to china, suffered stinging setbacks in local taiwanese elections in november. the opposition kuomintang won mayoralties in taiwan's three most populous cities, prompting ms. tsai to resign as leader of the democratic progressive party, though she remains taiwan's president.
consumers are another overlooked source of stable demand for u.s.-made products. indeed, their passion is cynically being used by companies that sell their made-in-china products as proudly american. further, some consumers are clearly willing to pay more for products that they know are better, healthier and more ethically sourced. thus, once consumers learn that not all generic drugs are alike, with pronounced differences in quality and safety, depending on the country of manufacture, many will gladly add a few cents for drugs using american-made active ingredients, perhaps with packages stating that their products are free from foreign-made active ingredients and were manufactured by fairly treated workers.
dr. robert r. redfield, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention, in an interview with mcclatchy on friday, warned that the riot could also end up significantly spreading the coronavirus. i do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event, he said. you had largely unmasked individuals in a nondistanced fashion, who were all through the capitol. with hopes having been buoyed by the arrival of covid-19 vaccines, then dimmed by the delays in rolling them out, dr. fauci urged americans to be patient. in his interview with npr, he said that any program so large in scale would hit stumbling blocks. and the holiday timing of the rollout may have added to the delays, he said. i think it would be fair to just observe what happens in the next couple of weeks, dr. fauci said. if we don't catch up on what the original goal was, then we really need to make some changes about what we're doing. karen zraick and

the american navy department has been informed that the chinese government has seized all the german ships, six in number, at shanghai. the crews have been landed and an armed guard has been placed on board each vessel. the decision of the chinese government to break with germany was definitely come to after the two houses of parliament, having taken cognizance of the report on the measures adopted and the government's intentions for the future, had given a vote of confidence, passed by a crushing majority.
during the conversation on saturday, a recording of which was obtained earlier by the washington post, mr. trump never mentioned senators david perdue and kelly loeffler, except to threaten brad raffensperger, georgia's republican secretary of state, that if he failed to find more votes for the president by tuesday, you're going to have people just not voting in the runoff contests. mr. trump is scheduled to campaign in the state on monday.

the story of an invisible hand controlling assets from a protected distance might seem like an imaginative leap. battles over estates are often the result of service providers charging a client — especially an elderly one — the most they can or of siblings taking large commissions to manage the financial affairs. discrepancies can result simply from careless record-keeping.
william joseph mcdonough was born on april 21, 1934, on chicago's west side to first-generation immigrants from ireland. his mother died when he was 10, and his father, who sold insurance, died within a year. he was sent to live with an aunt, but had to fend for himself financially by delivering newspapers.

the upheaval may have left george w. bush feeling uncomfortable, but he was not melancholy -- far from it. friends remember him as cheerful, vigorously involved in intramural sports at davenport, his residential college, and laughing with friends over beers.
if you want to see what all of your connected devices are doing online, check out the princeton iot inspector. you can run the software on a mac, but it's better suited to the raspberry pi, a $35 tiny computer that runs a variation of the open-source linux operating system. once installed, iot inspector constantly monitors the traffic into and out of your network, then displays it on a dashboard. using iot inspector, i found that my older-generation samsung tv, which can barely pull itself together long enough to launch netflix, frequently pings a site i assume is samsung's automatic content recognition software, which can track what you're watching by reading pixels to identify shows.
the utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. in addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to california's energy sector.
u.s.a. gymnastics wasn't informed in 2014 because the result of the investigation was that there was not a policy violation, and the local prosecutor's office reviewed the case and declined to press charges against nassar, jason cody, a spokesman for michigan state university, said in an email on tuesday. also, the complainant was not a gymnast or a minor, nor did the complaint involve allegations of penetration.

mr. biden's supporters argue that mr. trump's incendiary conduct and norm-breaking presidency have so imperiled the country that only somebody with the stature and experience of a two-term vice president can bring back stability. and, they contend, mr. trump has diminished the importance of ideological differences within the democratic party.
elon musk, the chief executive of tesla and spacex, is now the richest person in the world. an increase in tesla's share price on thursday pushed mr. musk past jeff bezos, the founder of amazon, on the bloomberg billionaires index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people. mr. musk's net worth was $195 billion by the end of trading on thursday, $10 billion more than that of mr. bezos's. mr. musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion over the past 12 months, thanks to a rally in tesla's share price, which surged 743 percent in 2020. the carmaker's shares rose nearly 8 percent on thursday.
mr. sanders's two apologies follow several recent articles describing harassment, sexism and gender discrimination in his 2016 campaign, including a report last week in the times and another on wednesday night in politico. several of his top aides and advisers have been implicated; jeff weaver, his campaign manager, has said he would not return in the same role if the vermont senator runs again.
in the past two decades, however, the demographic balance has shifted in favor of ethnic kazakhs, following the departure of many ethnic russians, whose numbers fell from about 40 percent of the population at independence to about 20 percent today. this opened the way for mr. nazarbayev to endorse the axing of cyrillic.
airline policies vary widely, depending on the flight and the carrier. during the first months of the pandemic, most u.s. airlines had a policy of blocking off seats, or allowing passengers to reschedule if a flight was near 70 percent full. but by the holidays those policies were largely phased out, said scott mayerowitz, executive editor at the points guy, a website that covers the industry.

many young people of privilege who encountered the 1960's began to question the system and their own values; mr. bush seems to have grasped his more tightly than ever. he may have broken the law, but he never questioned it. and today, much of his underlying political philosophy rests on the belief that the nation still needs to reverse the psychology of permissiveness and liberalism that began to take root in the country in the late 1960's.

amazon says it will spend $2 billion to address a shortage of affordable housing. amazon's seattle campus. the company is pledging more than $2 billion to affordable housing in three regions where it has or is building a large corporate presence. credit... grant hindsley for the new york times amazon said it was pledging more than $2 billion to affordable housing in three regions where it had or was building a large corporate presence, becoming the latest tech giant to make a large push into addressing housing costs in their hometowns. the resources, which will largely be in the form of low-cost loans, look to preserve or create 20,000 housing units in the seattle, northern virginia and nashville areas, the company said in a release. the company said it would pair the loans with $125 million in grants for government agencies and nonprofit and other organizations working to address racial equity in housing. as housing costs in tech hubs have skyrocketed in recent years, tech companies have put money into developing housing programs aimed at low- and middle-income families. microsoft has pledged $750 million in the seattle region since early 2019. in california, apple, facebook and google have committed a combined $4.5 billion to efforts in the past two years. in seattle, amazon has worked closely with mary's place, an organization that provides shelter for women and families, including building a shelter in one of its new office buildings.

jan. 7, 2021, 6:47 p.m. et jan. 7, 2021, 6:47 p.m. et assaulting officers, illegal guns and unlawful entry: violent protesters face federal charges. the police confronted intruders outside the senate chamber on jan. 6. credit... erin schaff/the new york times federal prosecutors on thursday filed their first charges stemming from wednesday's riot at the capitol, charging one man with assaulting a police officer and another with illegally possessing a loaded handgun. both criminal complaints were filed in federal district court in washington. the city's metropolitan police department had announced earlier that they had arrested nearly 70 people at the riot on charges that included unlawful entry, gun possession and assault. the united states capitol police announced the arrests of 14 other people on thursday. the first federal complaint accused mark j. leffingwell of assaulting a capitol police officer around 2:30 p.m. on wednesday in a hallway in the senate wing of the capitol building. the officer, daniel amendola, said in the complaint that mr. leffingwell was part of a crowd that had breached a window. when officer amendola sought to stop him and others from entering the building any further, mr. leffingwell punched him repeatedly in the head and chest, according to the complaint. mr. leffingwell then spontaneously apologized. prosecutors also unsealed charges against a maryland resident, christopher alberts, accusing him of illegally carrying a 9-millimeter pistol at the riot. officers first saw mr. alberts leaving the capitol complex around 7:30 p.m. and noticed a bulge on his right hip.

the intention is understandable, but this remedy is unworkable and unachievable. no president in the modern era has accepted the absolute requirement of congressional consent on war-making powers. moreover, any scenario for the first use of nuclear weapons implies great urgency because, over time, america's conventional military advantages would presumably suffice.
an explosive device is found at the r.n.c., and the d.n.c. is evacuated. an explosive device was found at the headquarters of the republican national committee in washington and the nearby headquarters of the democratic national committee was evacuated after the discovery of a suspicious package on wednesday, according to three people briefed on the discoveries. the device that was found at the r.n.c. was a pipe bomb that was successfully destroyed by a bomb squad, according to an official for the r.n.c. the package at the d.n.c. has yet to be identified, according to a top democrat briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. the r.n.c. and d.n.c. are headquartered just a few blocks away from the u.s. capitol, which mr. trump's supporters stormed on wednesday afternoon soon as congress had gathered to certify president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory and shortly after the president addressed the crowd near the white house. as a mob breached the capitol, vice president mike pence was rushed from the senate chamber and the building was placed on lockdown. shortly after, mr. trump tweeted that mr. pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done because he did not try to reject the electors. the national guard for washington and virginia was activated wednesday afternoon to respond to the unrest. and the federal authorities arrested a 70-year-old man from alabama near the capitol in possession of a firearm and materials to make several molotov cocktails.

citing incoming travelers, turkey becomes the 33rd country to find the virus variant first identified in britain. as of friday, british travelers are no longer allowed into turkey. the turkish health minister announced that the new variant of the coronavirus has been discovered in the country. credit... bradley secker for the new york times turkey slammed its doors to travelers from britain on friday, saying that it had found 15 infections with the new, more transmissible variant of the virus that first emerged in england. all were among recent arrivals from the united kingdom. turkey's health minister, fahrettin koca, issued a statement saying that the 15 people infected with the variant were in isolation and that their contacts were being traced and placed under quarantine. in countrywide checks, the statement said, the virus had not been detected in anyone other than travelers who arrived from britain. the finding brings the number of countries that have detected the variant to at least 33 since britain announced finding it on dec. 8, and the number of countries barring travelers arriving from britain to more than 40. some countries are also imposing restrictions on travelers, including u.s. citizens, who in recent weeks visited the countries where the variant has been detected. the philippines expanded restrictions on travelers from britain and 18 other countries, adding the united states after a third state, florida, reported an infection involving the variant.
some people are already experiencing delays getting their second stimulus payments. new yorkers wait outside a store advertising to cash stimulus checks. credit... sarah blesener for the new york times the federal government has only just begun sending out a second round of stimulus payments, and many people are already waiting a little longer than expected for their money. many payments have been sent to inactive or temporary accounts that taxpayers don't have access to. it's not clear how many people are affected, but the tax preparation company jackson hewitt said the internal revenue service had sent payments to more than 13 million bank accounts that were no longer open or valid. because of the speed at which the law required the i.r.s. to issue the second round of economic impact payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or no longer active, the agency said in a statement on tuesday. companies like turbotax, h&r block and jackson hewitt sometimes set up temporary accounts for clients when they prepare returns. for example, clients who opts to have preparation fees deducted from their refund may be issued one of these accounts, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. after that, the accounts are generally inactive — but may still be linked to the taxpayers in i.r.s. records. payments that are sent to inactive accounts must be returned to the treasury. by law, the i.r.s.

ford's sales fell 15 percent in 2020 because of the pandemic and model changes. ford's sales of f-series trucks — including the f-150 and larger versions — fell 12 percent last year. credit... nic antaya/getty images ford motor company said on wednesday that it sold about two million cars and light trucks last year, a decline of 15 percent from 2019, roughly in line with the broader auto industry. the coronavirus pandemic sharply slowed sales for automakers as people stayed away from dealerships and companies were forced to shut down factories for nearly two months last spring. ford's sales were also affected by company's decision to phase out most sedans, including the fusion and fiesta, from its u.s. lineup. ford said sales in the fourth quarter fell 10 percent. cars made up just 7 percent of total sales; the rest were trucks and sport-utility vehicles. the company said its shift to focus on larger vehicles is paying off. sales of sport utility vehicles, which generate much more profit for automakers than sedans, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter. also in the fourth quarter, ford began selling a redesigned version of its f-150 pickup truck, which has long been the top selling vehicle in the united states. the transition to the new model caused a temporary shortage of pickups that slowed sales. ford's sales of f-series trucks — including the f-150 and larger versions — fell 12 percent in 2020.

the findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 i.c.u. patients treated early with these drugs. all of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.
the pay-increase legislation requires that council members put online the financial disclosures they make to the city's conflicts of interest board. it also calls for changing when future quadrennial commissions are convened; instead of holding them during the second year of the body's four-year term, they would be held during the third year, to reduce the suggestion that the council was acting in its own behalf.
the exact timing of ms. warren's announcement — dec. 31 — is significant. it means that in a few weeks, she will have to report her fund-raising totals for the fourth quarter of 2018, which will reveal how much she received on day 1 in small-donor contributions — a key benchmark for popularity for democrats in the nominating race.

former state department officials and associates of mr. pompeo say he has been keen to ensure that american diplomats are not harmed under his watch, especially because as a congressman, he was among the most scathing critics of secretary of state hillary clinton's handling of a militant group's attack on an american compound in benghazi, libya. the 2012 assault resulted in the deaths of four americans, including ambassador j. christopher stevens.

each of these systems is navigating the pandemic on its own, meaning the experience of a child in one county can be completely different from the one right next to it. soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. in new york, the system ground to a halt. for a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said shantell lewis, a recruiter with the wendy's wonderful kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a brooklyn nonprofit called mercyfirst. though new york has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. this abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year. but today, those aging out of foster care are aging in to a country gripped by an ongoing pandemic and crippled economy. when a young person ages out of the system, we have in many ways already failed them, said rita soronen, president and chief executive of the dave thomas foundation for adoption.
a mismanaged white house, a poor professional reputation and a weak presidency are not impossible to fix. like mr. trump, other first-year presidents have had trouble adapting to the power dynamics of the white house and the washington community. while some never recovered from disastrous starts (jimmy carter), others found their footing and became widely influential over the executive agencies (bill clinton).

later, growing fearful of pan-turkic sentiment among kazakhs, uzbeks and other turkic peoples in the soviet union, moscow between 1938 and 1940 ordered that kazakh and other turkic languages be written in modified cyrillic as part of a push to promote russian culture. to try to ensure that different turkic peoples could not read one another's writings and develop a shared non-soviet sense of common identity, it introduced nearly 20 versions of cyrillic, mr. kocaoglu said.

those details alone, along with the fact of dr. ablow's celebrity, were enough for a good story. but what really compelled me was that monique turned out to be a therapist herself. this made it clear that really anyone could fall under the spell of a clinician. because she was a therapist, monique was extremely embarrassed by what had happened and was not eager to talk to a reporter — she felt she had nothing to gain by doing so. we talked and emailed first, and ultimately she agreed to meet and tell her story as long as she could use a pseudonym. she did not want her own patients to know what had happened. my editors agreed to grant this request for anonymity because of her unusual circumstance.
the spread between premiums for poor and excellent credit varies by state, since state regulators set rules for insurance and some allow credit history to be weighted more heavily than others do, ms. adams said.

biden drops plan to outline economic priorities amid chaos in washington. president-elect joseph r. biden jr. on wednesday. credit... doug mills/the new york times president-elect joseph r. biden jr. set aside plans to deliver a speech on the economy on wednesday afternoon, instead calling for an end to violent protests in washington and calling on president trump to stop what he called an insurrection. mr. biden's speech was expected to emphasize several of his economic priorities, including reiterating calls for another round of financial aid to help people, businesses and state and local governments weather ongoing economic pain from the virus. mr. biden was also expected to touch on his build back better agenda, including new government spending on clean energy, infrastructure, health care and education. the president-elect is still expected to deliver economic remarks in the coming days, and he will focus in particular on small businesses run by black, hispanic, asian and native americans, who need additional resources to reopen and rebuild, a transition spokesman said. the president-elect's ability to push through many of the programs and polices he campaigned on appeared more likely on wednesday, as democrats edged closer to gaining two senate seats after tuesday's runoff election in georgia. the rev. raphael warnock was declared the winner of one seat, defeating republican kelly loeffler, and jon ossoff, another democrat, was leading the race against david perdue.

my students, my children, my friends' children--our next generation--understand our new status: they do not want to be regarded as victims. they do not feel persecuted, discriminated against, or powerless. they want to read the new good news, not the old bad news. a 1988 poll of jewish students at dartmouth college made the point compellingly: when asked whether they believed that their jewishness would in any way hamper their future success, not a single student answered in the affirmative. that is the current reality, and it is different from the reality my parents faced--and even from the reality many of my generation perceived when we were in college or beginning our careers. the coming generation of jewish adults will not remain jews because of our enemies or because of our perceived status as victims. they crave a more positive, affirmative, contemporary, and relevant jewish identity. unless we move beyond victimization and toward a new jewish state of mind, many of them will abandon judaism as not relevant to their current concerns.

mr. mcconnell's remarks came on a day when he appeared to be headed back into the minority after six years of running the senate, thanks, at least in part, to mr. trump's relentless election attacks that have badly split the party. but while the president will be leaving office in two weeks, mr. mcconnell, 78, is likely to continue leading his party, and wants to play a crucial role in rebuilding it after years of mr. trump. the intraparty brawl prompted by the election challenges was a situation mr. mcconnell had feared and that had prompted him to initially refrain from recognizing mr. biden's victory for weeks after november's election, wary of inflaming mr. trump's grievances with his party. when he did recognize mr. biden, his critics argued that the acknowledgment came too late, and that by waiting silently, mr. mcconnell had allowed mr. trump to sow dangerous disinformation with millions of republican voters, drawing the backing of elected officials in his own party. on wednesday, mr. mcconnell said he had seen enough. it would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise american voters and overrule the courts and the states on this thin basis, he said. i will vote to respect the people's decision and defend our system of government as we know it.

in addition, as a so-called interpretive rule, it does not have the same legal force as a regulation, and it applies only to the laws that the labor department enforces, such as the federal minimum wage and overtime. states and other agencies, like the internal revenue service, may come to different conclusions about who has employee status. but the rule could still have a substantial impact because employers often base their labor practices on the department's approach. determinations of employee status typically hinge on several factors, but the department's rule elevates two: how much control an employer exerts over the worker, and the extent to which a worker can increase his or her hourly income through entrepreneurial savvy rather than earning a set wage. critics have argued that there is no legal basis for elevating these two factors above others, such as the degree of skill involved in the work or whether the work is indefinite or temporary, and that the approach will deny employee status to many who deserve it.

i believe that jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-semitism, the end of jewish persecution, and the end of jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. the ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative judaism--jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain jewish or to assimilate. we may be entering a true jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that jews do not need enemies to survive. to the contrary: we can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.
experts say the capitol hill riot was probably a super-spreader event. a mob of trump loyalists after forcing their way into the capitol on wednesday. credit... reuters the mob that stormed the capitol yesterday did not just threaten the heart of american democracy. to scientists who watched dismayed as the scenes unfolded on television, the throngs of unmasked intruders who wandered through hallways and into private offices may also have transformed the riot into a super-spreader event. the coronavirus thrives indoors, particularly in crowded spaces, lingering in the air in tiny particles called aerosols. if even a few of the pro-trump extremists were infected — likely, given the current rates of spread and the crowd size — then the virus would have had the ideal opportunity to find new victims, experts said. it has all the elements of what we warn people about, said anne rimoin, an epidemiologist at the university of california, los angeles. people yelling and screaming, chanting, exerting themselves — all of those things provide opportunity for the virus to spread, and this virus takes those opportunities. president trump has downplayed the pandemic almost since its beginning, and many of his supporters who entered the capitol yesterday did not appear to be wearing masks or making any effort at social distancing. under similar conditions, gatherings held in such close quarters have led to fast-spreading clusters of infection. similar concerns were raised by the black lives matter protests in the summer.

u.s. lost 140,000 jobs in december, the first decline since april. the already sputtering economic rebound went into reverse in december, as employers laid off workers amid rising coronavirus cases and waning government aid. u.s. employers cut 140,000 jobs in december, the labor department said friday. it was the first net decline in payrolls since last spring's mass layoffs, and though the december loss was nowhere near that scale, it represented a discouraging reversal for the once-promising recovery. the u.s. economy still has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic began. job growth reversed for the first time since april cumulative change in all jobs since before the pandemic by ella koeze · seasonally adjusted · source: bureau of labor statistics the december losses were heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. the industry cut nearly half a million jobs in december, while sectors less exposed to the pandemic continued to add workers. the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7 percent, down sharply from its high of nearly 15 percent in april but still close to double the 3.5 percent rate in the same month a year earlier. we're losing ground again, said diane swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm grant thornton. most notably, this is still very much a low-wage recession, and the losses were where we first saw them when the pandemic hit.
analysts say that mr. kim is making a calculation against the backdrop of the political uncertainty in the united states, where mr. trump faces both a senate impeachment trial and an election. the north korean leader, they said, doesn't necessarily want to rush to strike a deal that could be overturned if mr. trump does not win a second term.

the bloc also ordered 160 million doses of the moderna vaccine, which was approved by the european union drug regulator on wednesday, moving up a decision that had been scheduled for later in january. the european commission has come under fire for not ordering a sufficient number of vaccines, and has been blamed for the slow rollout in its 27 member countries. the european medicines agency, the regulator, has also been denounced for not yet having started a review of the university of oxford-astrazeneca vaccine, which has recently been approved for use in countries including britain and india. the commission has taken the lead in approving, negotiating and securing the vaccines on behalf of its members, and it has pushed back against the criticism, highlighting that the decision on how many doses to buy was made by national governments, and that the rollout itself was strictly national business. all the members do their utmost to move forward with the vaccination plan, ms. von der leyen said on friday. the beginning is always difficult, it is a logistical challenge.

the wealth of individual jews grew perceptibly during this decade, with 25 percent of america's richest people being of jewish background. (if only earned, as distinguished from inherited, wealth is counted, the percentage would be even higher.) an american leadership study in 1971-72 found that jews represented more than 10 percent of america's top movers and shakers in business, a higher percentage than any other ethnic group. jews' per capita income is nearly double that of non-jews. twice the percentage of jews as non-jews earn more than $50,000 a year. and twice the percentage of non-jews as jews earn less than $20,000. jewish charitable giving has increased along with jewish wealth. jews are now among the largest contributors to universities, museums, hospitals, symphonies, opera, and other charities. in 1991, the united jewish appeal raised more money than any other charity in america, including the salvation army, american red cross, catholic charities and the american cancer society. yet only one-tenth of jewish philanthropists limit their giving to jewish charities alone, while one-fourth give only to non-jewish causes.

andrew m. cuomo said new yorkers 75 and older and some essential workers, like teachers, police and public transit employees, will be able to schedule covid-19 vaccinations starting monday. credit credit... gregg vigliotti for the new york times after days of criticism over new york state's lagging vaccine distribution and a public fight with new york city's mayor, gov. andrew m. cuomo announced on friday that the state will begin allowing elderly new yorkers and essential workers like teachers, police and public transit employees to schedule vaccinations as soon as monday. the move will clear the way for an additional 3.2 million new yorkers to receive a vaccine, mr. cuomo said. since inoculations began last month, an estimated 2.1 million health care workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities had been eligible. mr. cuomo said it would take 14 weeks to vaccinate both groups based on the current rate at which the state was getting vaccine doses from the federal government. mr. cuomo's announcement came after repeated pressure from mayor bill de blasio of new york city and other local officials, who have called on the state to allow more access to the vaccine as doses distributed to hospitals have gone unused. under these guidelines, health care workers would still have priority in any reservation system, according to mr. cuomo. mr. de blasio said on twitter after mr. cuomo's announcement that the city would begin giving shots to city workers and those who are 75 years and older on monday.
the distinction is important as a matter of policy and strategy, as well as one of law. in 1975, the church committee, a select senate committee, launched an investigation into the activities of the united states' intelligence agencies, spurred on by reports of covert assassination attempts on foreign leaders, among them failed attempts against patrice lumumba of congo and fidel castro of cuba. the committee found that assassination was incompatible with american principle, international order, and morality. its final report recommended a ban on assassination in the absence of war and except in cases of imminent danger. though no such law was passed by congress, president gerald ford issued an executive order in 1976 banning political assassination.

while any such move by mr. trump is certain to prompt outrage from his critics and wild approval from his supporters, there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to result in much immediate change. his push for a wall would be channeled into a lengthy court fight, keeping lawyers far busier than construction workers, at least initially, as his term ticks away.

all of that changed when khrushchev was ousted by his colleagues in a palace coup in october 1964. his successors, leonid brezhnev and alexei kosygin, wanted to prove that they were truly committed to an ally in need by providing military aid. the underlying rationale was that the new soviet leadership faced a deficit of political legitimacy. aiding vietnam in a war against imperialism helped them in being recognized — by their people, their clients and allies and the broader world — as the legitimate heirs to the leadership of the socialist camp. for the same reason, moscow attempted to improve relations with china.

since the midterm election showed the political costs that trump inflicts on republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. they have broken with him on foreign policy (in saudi arabia, yemen and syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. when support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.
mr. trump took to twitter on friday shortly after the vote to register his anger at republican lawmakers' unwillingness to meet his demands.
the pipe bombs found at democratic and republican headquarters were said to contain timing devices. the pipe bombs found on wednesday afternoon outside the democratic and republican party headquarters, blocks from the capitol, contained crude mechanical timing devices, according to an official familiar with their initial examination, suggesting they were intended to be detonated. it was not clear when they were meant to explode, but thousands of people were in the area that afternoon as a mob encouraged by president trump stormed the capitol, where lawmakers had convened to certify president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s election, leaving five people dead. it was also not clear whether the bombs were connected to the siege. the two bombs appeared to be similar, the official said. they were relatively unsophisticated and incorporated a mechanical timer, steel wool and an unknown powder as their explosive fill, the official said. one of the devices was found with a cell phone, which could have been incorporated to detonate the bomb. photographs of the intact bombs were shared with the new york times. image an image of an explosive device that was found and disabled near the democratic national committee headquarters in washington. credit... obtained by the new york times bomb squad technicians disabled the devices, which were constructed of steel pipes that appear to be about one and a half inches in diameter and 12 inches long. the f.b.i. has posted a $50,000 reward for information about a possible suspect.

in the short term, the narrowness of democratic control — a 50-50 senate, with ties broken by incoming vice president kamala harris, and a slim majority in the house — means that stimulus is more likely than changes to taxes. we consider it unlikely that the new treasury secretary, janet yellen, would pursue policies that could stifle the u.s. economic recovery. given her dovish leaning, her focus will likely be on more stimulus instead, wrote holger schmieding of berenberg bank.

the capitol rampage drew rebukes from business leaders, but not always of the president. when jamie dimon, the chief executive of jpmorgan chase, issued a statement condemning the violence in washington on wednesday, he urged our elected leaders to call for an end to it. he did not directly mention president trump. nor did the charles scharf, the chief executive of wells fargo (the behavior in washington, d.c., today is unacceptable) or the chief executives of goldman sachs, bank of america or citigroup. business leaders and organizations often instead referred to leaders or called for the peaceful transition of power to president-elect joseph r. biden jr. business leaders have rarely criticized mr. trump directly. when he announced, shortly before he was inaugurated, that stephen k. bannon would be his chief strategist in the white house, democrats on the congressional committees that oversee the finance industry asked industry leaders to publicly oppose the appointment. the lawmakers called mr. bannon a bigot beloved by white supremacists and said the business leaders had a moral obligation to speak out. none did. after mr. trump took office, chief executives found themselves in the uncomfortable position of deciding whether to take part in so-called business advisory councils, common forums for business leaders to influence the policy of a new president, even as he was rolling out policies many saw as hateful.

until the u.s. invasion of iraq, the country was ruled by saddam hussein and sunnis, and shias who were aligned to iran were marginalized. when the united states toppled saddam hussein, shias rose to power, and many of these shia leaders and political and religious figures had very close ties to iran. and iran really seized that opportunity. it used these contacts and networks and relationships to gain influence and penetrate iraqi society. and general suleimani once again becomes the pivotal character in helping realize this strategy and this aspiration.
this is where having credibility — and having a president who didn't lie about everything — would be really, really helpful, samantha power, the former united states ambassador to the united nations, wrote recently.

as senator ron johnson, the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, has put it, the long-term growth of living standards depends on periodically lightening the regulatory load – the equivalent of scraping barnacles off the bottom.
general suleimani uses the opening to further expand iran's influence in iraq and in the region. he helps create shia militia. he recruits allies, a network of politicians, religious men and militant groups who were loyal to iran's ambitions in iraq. the shia militia that he helped create were also responsible for attacks on u.s. soldiers, for the killing of u.s. soldiers, and for civilian deaths. when the civil war started in syria in 2011, iran vowed to keep president bashar al-assad in power. mr. assad and his constituents are an offshoot of shia islam, and religiously and politically aligned with iran. this is where iraq comes in. because of the relationships and networks and influence that general suleimani had in iraq, he was able to use iraq by land and by air to funnel support for syria's war. weapons, missiles, even soldiers that were trained in iran were shipped to syria by way of iraq.

but if removing him will not be easy, it's not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. from the beginning, trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. although members of congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.

with the victories of jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock in georgia's senate runoffs on tuesday, democrats will have the slimmest possible majority in the senate, 50-50 with vice president-elect kamala harris breaking ties. (democrats' 50-vote total includes two independents who caucus with them.) ms. murkowski did not say whether she would caucus with the democrats if she left the republican party, but even a decision to become an independent would significantly change the political dynamics in the chamber. if she decided to switch parties, she would not be the first to do so in recent years. representative jeff van drew of new jersey was elected as a democrat in 2018 but became a republican in response to the first impeachment proceedings against mr. trump; shortly before that, representative justin amash of michigan changed his affiliation from republican to independent. the last time a sitting senator switched parties was in 2009, when arlen specter of pennsylvania left the republican party and joined the democrats, who had just won unified control of washington. congressional republicans have broadly condemned the actions of the pro-trump mob that stormed the capitol on wednesday in opposition to the formalizing of president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory, even though many of them spent the past two months promoting the baseless assertions of election fraud that motivated the mob, and 147 voted to reject the election results.

as i set about thinking about all of this, i got in touch with audrey bedolis, a lawyer who has specialized in therapeutic malpractice for almost 30 years. she told me about a client she had several years before, who felt damaged by her treatment. the therapist her client had seen in 2010 and 2011 was named dr. keith ablow. i had never heard of him. but as it happened, he was very well known to viewers of fox news, where he had a long stint analyzing the psychological motivations of political leaders in ways that served the network's ideological mission.
in that way, she reminds me of another midwestern senator who once seemed too ordinary to be president: harry truman. in the summer of 1944, an even more perilous time for global democracy than now, democratic party grandees chose truman as vice president with the belief that he would soon be president, given franklin roosevelt's declining health.
i think that, all things considered, there is probably more tension than alignment with this goal. to be sure, donors tend to be more ideological than non-donors, so donors to democratic candidates and/or the democratic party are going to be fairly liberal on average. at the same time, donors, particularly significant donors, are likely to be fairly affluent, and therefore heavily invested in the status quo.
one such action kept in place obama-era standards on smog-causing emissions that, even when originally issued, fell short of the standard recommended by public health experts. another imposed the federal government's first regulation to control planet-warming pollution from airplanes but did not require airlines to go beyond emissions limits that they had set for themselves. and a third updates regulations around lead pipes in a way that environmental critics said falls far short of an overhaul needed to ensure safe drinking water.

our goal should be a self-sustaining judaism that can thrive in the kind of open society in which most jews want to spend their lives. i strongly believe that it is essential--both for jews and for america--that the mainstream american jewish community flourish. it would be a tragedy if the only forms of judaism the made it past the twenty-first century were insular, ultra-orthodox judaism and israeli zionism. i hope that they, too, will continue to prosper, but i believe that a more diverse jewish life has even more to contribute. if i have a bias, it is in favor of an eclectic, tolerant many-branched menorah that is inclusive of all who wish to safeguard and share the future of the jewish people.

elon musk has become the world's richest person, as tesla's stock rallies. credit... odd andersen/agence france-presse — getty images elon musk, the chief executive of tesla and spacex, is now the richest person in the world. an increase in tesla's share price on thursday pushed mr. musk past jeff bezos, the founder of amazon, on the bloomberg billionaires index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people. mr. musk's net worth was $195 billion by the end of trading on thursday, $10 billion more than that of mr. bezos's. mr. musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion over the past 12 months, thanks to a rally in tesla's share price, which surged 743 percent in 2020. the carmaker's shares rose nearly 8 percent on thursday. how strange, mr. musk said on twitter. well, back to work, he added. mr. musk, a south african-born entrepreneur, would not have been able to edge out mr. bezos — who has held the title of the richest person in the world since oct. 2017 — were it not for mr. bezos' philanthropy, including his donation of $680 million worth of amazon shares in november, as well as his divorce, which caused him to relinquish about 25 percent of his stock in the e-commerce giant to mackenzie scott, his ex-wife.

it's not just the money. to say that there is less use for a 62-year-old white male (unless you happen to be running for president) these days is not to devalue the social transformations that are rapidly occurring in the age of trump. you can hail necessary social change and complain about being, to some degree, a casualty of it, both at the same time.

in other cases, iranian support for the insurgency has been more significant. afghan and western officials say they know of taliban offices in several iranian cities. and the taliban's former supreme leader, mullah akhtar mohammad mansour, had started making trips to iran from his base in pakistan. he was returning from one of those trips when a united states drone strike killed him in 2016.
but even that was not comparable to what unfolded at the capitol on wednesday, said jeremiah ellison, a minneapolis city councilman. in the days preceding the burning of the precinct, the police had been firing rubber bullets and tear-gas at protesters in what mr. ellison said he believed was an overreaction at times.

most collectors will buy a watch because a) they don't have it b) they have one but in poorer condition or c) it's part of a family or set that they are trying to complete. and then there are those who buy watches just because they can. they collect to keep. they aren't so concerned with upgrading because they often start with the very best. ultimately though, everyone is collecting to upgrade, because tastes change over time and new pieces become available. every watch has its price, and sometimes that means starting over. one of the consignors from the heuer parade auction held last year sold most of his collection because he felt he had done it. he had spent almost a decade finding heuer chronographs from a specific era, and once he had them, he needed a new challenge. he is still collecting watches today, but from other manufacturers.

on the one hand are the rich, who are accustomed to finding workarounds whenever they want something that is in short supply and see little need for a different approach when it comes to protecting themselves from a disease that has largely devastated the underclass. and then there are the skeptics who believe that the vaccine is trouble. in a survey of 1,117 americans, conducted in early december, a quarter of respondents said they would not take the vaccine when it became available to them, while another quarter said that they were not sure. a little over a week ago, lara devgan posted a video of herself getting the vaccine on instagram. a park avenue plastic surgeon, she'd been hearing from some of her patients — those who have had cosmetic fillers — that they were worried the vaccine would cause temporary facial swelling. as someone who performs injectable facial fillers — who likes them and uses them myself — i believe the vaccine is safe,'' dr. devgan said, and the concept about worrying about how your face looks is not a reason not to get the vaccine.

while mr. warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first democrat to be elected to the senate from georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved ossoff-perdue race and its implications for the next two years in american politics. whichever party wins that race will control the senate, with republicans counting on mr. perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain mr. biden's policy ambitions. ms. loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. in recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with mr. trump in northwest georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to mr. biden when congress meets on wednesday. mr. warnock and mr. ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. republicans used much of the runoff to focus on mr. warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize african-american voters, especially in more conservative rural georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.

84 house democrats call for trump to be removed from office before his term ends. with less than two weeks left in the president's term, another impeachment effort is unlikely to be successful. credit... anna moneymaker for the new york times more than 80 house democrats have called for president trump to be impeached or removed from office, citing the chaos he stoked after he refused to accept the results of the election and encouraged his supporters to march on the capitol. representative katherine clark of massachusetts, the assistant speaker, on wednesday became the highest-ranking lawmaker to demand mr. trump's removal, calling him a traitor to our country and our constitution. he must be removed from office and prevented from further endangering our country and our people, ms. clark said. representative alexandria ocasio-cortez, democrat of new york, was more concise, simply posting the word impeach on twitter. in the hours after mr. trump's supporters stormed the capitol, forcing senators and members of the house to seek refuge, a growing number of lawmakers were calling for the president's removal. at least 84 house democrats said they supported efforts to remove mr. trump by way of impeachment or by having the cabinet invoke the 25th amendment, which provides procedures that can be used to replace a sitting president who is no longer capable of fulfilling his duties. mr. trump has two weeks remaining in his term in office.

yes, not everything trump has done fits mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly jacksonian. a hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against north korea; a wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. a hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with china; a wilsonian would speak out more clearly against beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of syria and afghanistan are patently jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. his eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are jacksonianism at its worst.
and the law's signature program to encourage businesses to keep people on their payrolls, the paycheck protection program, prevented a collapse in proprietor's income — profits that accrued to owners of businesses and farms. this income rose narrowly, by $29 billion, but would have fallen by $143 billion if not for the p.p.p. and a coronavirus food assistance program.

the police arrested mr. bush and charged him with disorderly conduct. eventually the charges were dropped, but the episode underscored mr. bush's path through the uproar of the late 1960's: at a time when many university students risked arrest for their vociferous political protests, mr. bush broke the law not out of principle but for a prank. others denounced the police as pigs, while mr. bush instinctively stood with the establishment, even as he casually breached its law.
this speaks to a feeling known all too well by those who've experienced the only one in the room syndrome. for those who haven't: being the lone minority in, say, a work environment or classroom can create an unsettling sense that people are silently observing your every move, no matter how mundane. here the episode writer stephen glover brings that nagging notion to life.

and a year ago, for example, a representative for the national psoriasis foundation did not disclose that her group receives at least 40 percent of its annual revenues from drug companies when she testified before the north carolina state legislature on an unsuccessful measure supported by the pharmaceutical industry that would have limited insurers' ability to block coverage of certain drugs. similarly, the hemophilia foundation did not disclose its pharmaceutical ties when it took the industry's side in 2015 in a letter to the food and drug administration over the issue of biosimilars, which are cheaper alternatives to complex biological drugs.

and yet, incredibly, the response of australia's leaders to this unprecedented national crisis has been not to defend their country but to defend the fossil fuel industry, a big donor to both major parties — as if they were willing the country to its doom. while the fires were exploding in mid-december, the leader of the opposition labor party went on a tour of coal mining communities expressing his unequivocal support for coal exports. the prime minister, the conservative scott morrison, went on vacation to hawaii.
the president's mercurial approach to iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including european nato allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 iran nuclear deal and arab nations in the persian gulf region uncertain about mr. trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from iran.

the u.k. tinkers with its vaccination procedures while the u.s. balks at changes. britain has been moving away from the dosing regimens tested in the late-stage clinical trials of the vaccines the country is deploying. credit... andrew testa for the new york times the united states and britain this week diverged further in their vaccination strategies as american scientists, health experts and federal officials questioned or dismissed recent decisions made by officials in the u.k. britain has been straying increasingly from the dosing regimens tested in late-stage clinical trials run by the pharmaceutical companies pfizer, moderna and astrazeneca. on wednesday, british health officials announced that they would delay second doses of vaccines made by pfizer and astrazeneca to concentrate on giving more people first injections — an attempt to more widely distribute the partial protections afforded by a single shot. the idea has gained proponents in both countries. but many have also spoken out against the deviations from typical procedure, made without public meetings or strong data to support them. some experts — including dr. anthony s. fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the united states — balked at the prospect of implementing the idea in the u.s., where vaccine rollouts have already been stymied by myriad logistical hurdles and a patchwork approach to prioritizing who gets the first shots. also, britain has quietly updated its vaccination playbook to allow for a mix-and-match regimen.

his troubles are a ground-level indicator of what economists say is the biggest financial threat to iraq since saddam hussein's time. iraq is running out of money to pay its bills. that has created a financial crisis with the potential to destabilize the government — which was ousted a year ago after mass protests over corruption and unemployment — touch off fighting among armed groups, and empower iraq's neighbor and longtime rival, iran.
whether military matters come to dominate the primary, in the remaining month before the iowa caucuses, is likely to depend on events in iraq and iran — and perhaps in neighboring countries — and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with iran turns out to be. foreign affairs have so far played a strictly limited role in the democratic race.
the core of the edge of anarchy is a thrilling description of the boycott of pullman cars and equipment by eugene debs's fledgling american railway union. the strike caused much of the country's commerce to grind to a halt, federal troops were called out over the objections of state officials, and many lives were lost. mr. kelly closely scrutinizes the roles not only of the american railway union and management but of state, local and federal officials, the courts, industry, the press, activists, and labor. no one comes out unscathed.

we took action last night to stop a war. we did not take action to start a war, mr. trump said. the president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. but his policy toward iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.

the second is that even skilled traders may need to be willing to incur major losses — which explains why hedge funds that face redemption requests from investors can face major problems even when their underlying investment thesis is right. the big short, the book and newly released movie, captures this nicely when a hedge fund manager who correctly bet against mortgage-related securities faced angry investors who sought to withdraw money while waiting to be vindicated.

it does not surprise me at all that the 25th amendment is being discussed, he told cnbc, adding that the president had become increasingly erratic. clearly he is not the same as he was eight months ago, and certainly the people advising him are not the same as they were eight months ago, and that leads to a dangerous sort of combination, as you saw yesterday.

for example, the king of the camp run at a u.s. military base in iraq, or the embassy river wall segment in baghdad's green zone, or the perimeter base run where more than 15 individuals stationed at a u.s. military base challenge themselves. we found photos posted by users from inside military bases and the online profiles of several u.s. service members stationed at one base near mosul in iraq. a pentagon spokeswoman said that this data release emphasized the need for personnel to have situational awareness. and it's assessing if any additional training or guidance is required. there are some areas where people presumably are not allowed to bring their cellphones. user activity at c.i.a. and n.s.a. headquarters, for instance, can be seen around the perimeters, but not beyond certain points inside the structure. but out in the remote corners of the world where the u.s. military is operating, there's plenty to see.

which is to say, it was worth it! however ridiculous the machinations that led up to it, the great walker harvest of 2017 was one of the more enjoyable zombie gimmicks the show has yet offered. the explosives and the herd will definitely come into play later, but the scene was more broadly a reassurance for fans that, even though the show got bogged down in angst earlier this season, it hasn't forgotten that it's part sociological drama, part horror thrill ride.

separating health insurance from employment has also freed people to pursue the work they want to be doing. health care expansions can decrease job lock, the phenomenon of people staying in jobs because they can't afford to strike out on their own and lose their insurance. preliminary research indicates this may be happening for americans who can fall back on the a.c.a. nearly one and a half million self-employed people and small-business owners got coverage through its exchanges in 2014.

he added that there were also public policy implications to wealthy people's funding research for certain diseases over others. there's a significant value in having the american public funding these diseases, he said. these philanthropists are doing great things, but their targets are going to be a function of what their daughter got. sometimes that's going to overlap with what the public needs. sometimes that's just not going to match up with the priorities that come out of the diseases other people get.

in a remote part of afghanistan — a us military outpost. in the middle of niger the outlines of an expanded base and airstrip. in syria, exercise routines and possible patrolling routes on a base where american special forces trained. by design, these secretive locations are supposed to be difficult to spot. but a heat map posted online by strava, a company that tracks people's exercise routes, has inadvertently put these places on public display for all the world to see. many of the military bases are already well known, like bagram and kandahar air fields in afghanistan. and the material we're revealing here doesn't go beyond anything that isn't already available on the open web. but strava's platform has drawn attention in a new way to the activity of military personnel in far flung outposts and has laid bare some loopholes in the security of military bases. how did this happen? strava is an app and social network that connects with devices like fitbit and is used to log workouts. it's popular with u.s. soldiers and others stationed abroad and the pentagon has distributed several thousand of them to its personnel. they use it to track their exercise routines and everyday activities like walks or patrols. but it also tracks users' locations, and in november 2017 the company updated a map showing over 1 billion activities and 3 trillion gps points. twenty-year-old international security student nathan ruser was the first to point out how strava's map could compromise operational security.

was the one deciding who would live and who would die, who was worthy. in many places around the country, ems hasn't been transporting ooh-cas for several years. ebm has proven time and time again that if ems can't get a pulse back, the likelihood of the er getting pulses is very, very low... — shao trommashere (@medictrommasher) january 1, 2021 ms. dickerson said she was concerned that these misunderstandings could lead to anger at personnel who had to break the news that someone had died, with families wondering, did they do this on purpose, did they not work as hard as they would have for somebody that looks like them? she added, people are already worried that there's some hierarchy of who gets care even prior to a pandemic, and now that we're in it, it's even worse. research shows that once e.m.s. had attempted without success to resuscitate them, patients like those described in the los angeles directive rarely live, even if transported to a hospital, said dr. jeffrey m. goodloe, a director of the american college of emergency physicians. none of us, ever, want to withhold the chance of survival from someone that is depending upon us, said dr. goodloe, who is also chief medical officer for an e.m.s. system covering oklahoma city and tulsa. so for areas where hospital wards are overflowing and empty beds are scarce, he said, the best advice we can give somebody is work to keep yourself well so you don't need e.m.s.
mr. jeffries and mr. stringer also enjoy warmer relations with gov. andrew m. cuomo, a democrat who clashes often with the mayor. the governor hosted a fund-raising event for mr. jeffries's congressional campaign in november, praising the congressman, according to attendees, as a democrat who knows how to get things done.

even though cases are exploding in mexico city, americans are pouring in. mexico has seen an increase in american tourists despite mounting coronavirus cases that have swamped the health care system throughout the country. credit... alfredo estrella/agence france-presse — getty images in november, more than half a million americans came to mexico — of those, almost 50,000 arrived at mexico city's airport, according to official figures, less than half the number of u.s. visitors who arrived in november last year, but a surge from the paltry 4,000 who came in april, when much of mexico was shut down. since then, numbers have steadily ticked up: from june to august, u.s. visitors in mexico more than doubled. it's unclear how many are visiting and how many are permanently relocating — or even just taking advantage of the six-month tourist visa that americans are granted on arrival. some may be mexicans who also have american passports and are visiting family. but on the streets of mexico city's hipster neighborhoods these days, it sometimes seems as if english has become the official language. the surge in visitors, however, comes as mexico city enters a critical phase of the pandemic; cases have increased, and hospitals are stretched so thin that many sick people are staying home. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention have also advised americans to avoid all travel to mexico. mexico city's health care system is basically overwhelmed, xavier tello, a mexico city health policy analyst, said via whatsapp message.

officials warn of renewed fraud around stimulus payments. credit... eric gay/associated press state and federal officials are warning consumers about potential fraud involving the coronavirus stimulus payments that are now being distributed by check and direct deposit. the better business bureau said wednesday that people receiving the payments should beware of calls or text messages seeking personal information that could leave their accounts vulnerable. callers might imply they are government employees, and text messages might direct consumers to click on a link leading to requests for personal information. while many americans have already received the second round of aid, many others are still waiting for their money. the bureau said it had heard from numerous consumers complaining they had been contacted by potential fraudsters. this is not the first time officials have warned of fraud linked to the pandemic. in april, the federal bureau of investigation issued a warning about scammers looking to sell false coronavirus tests, cures, treatments and vaccines. similar alerts were issued in june, including the f.b.i. 's warning of scammers' using advertisements for fraudulent covid-19 antibody tests as a way to obtain information they could use for identity theft or medical insurance fraud. the federal trade commission also alerted consumers about scammers pretending to be contact tracers, as did the internal revenue service about frauds involving government stimulus payments. attorneys general in several states, including west virginia and florida, added their warnings to the chorus on tuesday.
here's what it would take to impeach trump in 12 days. past presidential impeachments have typically been drawn-out affairs with investigations, hearings and weeks of public debate. credit... pete marovich for the new york times the threat to impeach president trump in his final days in office raises political, constitutional and logistical questions rarely contemplated in american history: no president has ever been impeached twice or after already losing re-election. here are four key things to know: there is nothing preventing a second impeachment. the house impeached mr. trump in december 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress related to his attempts to pressure ukraine to smear joseph r. biden jr., and the senate acquitted him. no american president has ever been impeached twice. but there appears to be nothing in the constitution stopping congress from impeaching again on a new set of charges. the timing is tight, but not impossible. past presidential impeachments have typically been drawn-out affairs with investigations, hearings and weeks of public debate, but that is not required. if democrats and some republicans are in agreement, they can bypass the house judiciary committee and move in a matter of days to draw up charges and proceed directly to a debate and vote on the floor of the house. then, if the house votes to adopt articles of impeachment, they can immediately transmit them to the senate, which must promptly begin a trial. the impeachment process could continue after mr. trump leaves office.

since that executive order, some presidents have claimed the authority to circumvent the ban when they deemed it necessary. ronald reagan, reportedly claiming to act in good faith and within the context of an approved operation, launched a failed attack on the lebanese cleric mohammed hussein fadlallah. the clinton administration, in considering plans for targeting osama bin laden, determined it would be an act of self-defense, and therefore not an assassination.
he helps them come up with battlefield plans, and he dispatches his underlings to go and train and fund and form these groups, providing them with weapons, providing them with money, and providing them with strategy. and he gains this reputation of being the shadow commander, the man who's everywhere but nowhere. if general suleimani is present on the ground, then iran is present.

solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: they eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. but markets don't always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.
so let's be clear. trump's ideology is not an impeachable offense. however much you may disagree with trump's tax policy — and i disagree vehemently — it is not a reason to remove him from office. nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. these issues are not the treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors that the founders intended impeachment to address.

no, there is no evidence that antifa activists stormed the capitol. a sign that was posted inside the capitol after a pro-trump mob broke in on wednesday. credit... jon cherry/getty images in thousands of posts on twitter and facebook, members of the far right pushed the unfounded claim that the pro-trump mob that stormed the capitol on wednesday, carrying trump flags and halting congress's counting of electoral votes, was made up of liberal activists posing as a pro-trump community to give it a bad name. several posts shared by thousands of people held up photographs as evidence that antifa supporters were behind the unrest. but those images did not, in fact, show antifa involvement. instead, some of the photographs, and the information contained in them, suggested ties to far right movements. even president trump acknowledged that the people who supported him — not liberal activists — had invaded the capitol. at one point on wednesday he told the mob that we love you. among the most popular figures pushing the conspiracy theory were the commentator candace owens, the georgia lawyer l. lin wood and juanita broaddrick, a nursing home administrator who in 1999 publicly accused president bill clinton of raping her in 1978. other prominent figures spreading the rumor included ken paxton, the attorney general of texas; sarah palin, the former vice-presidential candidate; and representative mo brooks, an alabama republican.

and while running big deficits might have once stoked fears about inflation — as too many dollars chased too few goods — price gains have been too low for comfort for years. add to that the emergency needs prompted by the pandemic, and even the fed's leader, who had long warned about the nation's debt load, has said this is a reasonable time to spend money.
presidents george w. bush and barack obama had considered taking out general suleimani but rejected it — not for lack of nerve, but for fear of undue escalation and an unnecessary war with iran. the fundamental facts on the ground have not changed, and in the kind of robust interagency, national security decision-making process that the national security council staff is supposed to supervise, such concerns would have been systematically raised, dissected and discussed, and a consensus reached to inform presidential action. no such process seems to have occurred here.

so this response that we saw at the funeral on monday — are you saying that the united states may not have expected this? because it sounds like the u.s. understood one aspect of suleimani's role in iran, as the leader of this military strategy, but perhaps they didn't understand something that's equally as important, which is what he meant in the hearts of iranians.

you might expect that paul collier, a noted development economist at oxford who has devoted most of his professional life to the uplift of the global poor, would see himself as a citizen of the world. but that's not quite right. collier grew up in sheffield, a once-flourishing english steel town that provided working-class families like his own with a modicum of prosperity and stability, and that has since struggled in the face of import competition and the loss of many of its most ambitious citizens to london and other dynamic cities. he attributes his prodigious accomplishments in no small part to the cooperative character of the community, and the nation, in which he was raised.

to protect the state capitol, washington state activates the national guard. the washington national guard, activated in seattle during protests over george floyd's death in june, has been called into action by gov. jay inslee of washington state to protect the capitol in olympia. credit... ruth fremson/the new york times gov. jay inslee of washington state said friday that he had activated the national guard to help secure buildings at the state capitol. right-wing groups have scheduled events at the capitol around the start of the legislative session next week, although some organizers have backed away from a declared plan to enter and occupy the building. mr. inslee said the state needed to do whatever it could to ensure that lawmakers are able to work without fear, intimidation or harassment. any illegal intrusion of the capitol, state buildings or restricted areas will not be tolerated and strictly enforced, mr. inslee said. as a pro-trump mob descended on the united states capitol earlier this week, another group breached the fence surrounding the washington state governor's mansion in olympia. state troopers later dispersed that crowd. the state capitol has been the scene of other volatile protests in recent months, often around coronavirus restrictions that mr. inslee has put in effect. mr. inslee said he was authorizing up to 750 members of the national guard and a large number of washington state patrol troopers to be on hand. that's in addition to the regular security on the capitol campus.

while national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. for starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. as a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.
more than 17 million people near beijing are under stay-at-home orders. workers carried coronavirus test samples in shijiazhuang, china, the capital of hebei province, on friday. credit... mu yu/xinhua, via associated press the chinese authorities have imposed a stay-at-home order on more than 17 million people in two cities in the northern province of hebei, an effort to stop the country's worst coronavirus flare-up in months from spreading to nearby beijing, the capital. officials in the two cities, shijiazhuang and xingtai, told residents on friday to stay at home for seven days to prevent further spread of an outbreak that has caused 349 reported infections in the past week, mostly in shijiazhuang. residents of shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million that is scheduled to host several events for the 2022 winter olympic games, were barred earlier this week from leaving the city. major highways have been blocked, train and bus stations closed and most flights canceled. on saturday, subway, bus and taxi services were also suspended. millions of people across hebei have been tested in recent days, while people who recently traveled to shijiazhuang and xingtai are being scrutinized. chifeng, a city in the northern region of inner mongolia, announced on friday that it was shifting to wartime footing after discovering that more than 3,600 people from the two hebei cities had visited in recent days. the stay-at-home order on friday came suddenly, leaving some residents without time to stockpile food.

the possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the democratic race. mr. trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the united states from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a republican because of the perception that he would pursue an america first policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.

the most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. despite the war powers act and the larger lessons of vietnam, congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. in response to the terrorist attacks of sept. 11, congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave president george w. bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.

the share of american women who are working has stalled, researchers say, hurting families' incomes and the country's economic output, even as that share has continued to climb in other rich countries. as employment has improved since the last recession, men have benefited more than women. economists have pinpointed the lack of family-friendly policies as a big reason. in canada, by comparison, some parents can stretch out their paid leave over 18 months, and in britain, many parents can take one year. both nations also provide subsidized child care.
as long as the neutral interest rate — the setting at which fed policy neither stokes nor slows growth — remains from 2 percent to 3 percent counting inflation, the fed should be able to rely on tactics like snapping up bonds and promising to keep rates low in the event of another recession. but the neutral rate has been creeping lower for decades, dragged down by powerful and slow-moving forces like population aging. should it continue to fall, the tricks mr. bernanke and his fed used to coax the economy back from the brink in the 2007 to 2009 recession might prove insufficient.
let's explain it to him. it's called nepotism, and it's clearly outlawed under the city charter, new york's equivalent of a constitution. right there in chapter 68 it forbids public servants to use their position to obtain any financial gain, contract, license, privilege or other private or personal advantage, direct or indirect, for the public servant or any person or firm associated with the public servant. ms. mccray, married to mr. de blasio since 1994, surely qualifies as a person associated with a public servant.
it basically worked. we've had four long economic booms since then. but there was an interesting cultural shift that happened along the way. in a healthy society, people try to balance a whole bunch of different priorities: economic, social, moral, familial. somehow over the past 40 years economic priorities took the top spot and obliterated everything else. as a matter of policy, we privileged economics and then eventually no longer could even see that there could be other priorities.

the woefully underfunded parole system fell in line with the jail-first agenda. parole officers, who were buried under massive caseloads, sent parolees back inside for technical violations, like failing drug tests, missing curfew or socializing with friends they had been forbidden to see. with nearly five million people in the nation under supervision — more than twice the number housed in prisons and jails — the parole and probation systems have become what corrections researchers now describe as a significant driver of recidivism.

when the minimum wage goes up for everyone, it is not so easy for employers to substitute better-skilled workers because the new minimum would not offer a more attractive wage. in many cases, more highly skilled workers see their wages rise after minimum-wage increases to keep them above the new minimum, making it all the more difficult to lure them away.
strong economic growth fueled the fed's decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018, into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. the rate, which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier, now sits at the lower end of the range that fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of neutrality, meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth.

what he called crazy predictions on covid — the united nations said in april that up to 3.3 million africans would die from it, for example — meant that harsh lockdowns were imposed. the economic and social effects of these would be felt in africa for decades, dr. job said. families often don't know they are expected to report deaths, or even if they do, there is little incentive to do so. many families bury loved ones in the yard at home, where they don't need a burial permit, let alone a death certificate. among a number of reasons the covid-19 caseload might be vastly underreported in many countries are stigma, an inability to get tested and the fact that the threshold for reacting to any disease is high. every time somebody says, 'i'm so glad africa has been spared,' my toes just curl, said maysoon dahab, an infectious disease epidemiologist at king's college london.

many countries have already restricted travel from the united states because of its staggering number of infections — the most in the world. california and colorado have also found cases involving the variant. none of those infected in the united states had traveled recently, so the new strain is clearly circulating, though at unknown levels. the variant, known as b.1.1.7., has not been known to lead to more severe cases of covid-19, but its circulation is likely to portend more infections and more hospitalizations at a time when many countries are already battling surges in caseloads and anticipating more from holiday gatherings and travel. the list of countries that have identified infections with the variant has been growing rapidly, and as of friday includes — besides the united states, britain and turkey — australia, belgium, brazil, canada, chile, china, denmark, finland, france, germany, iceland, india, ireland, israel, italy, japan, jordan, lebanon, malta, the netherlands, norway, pakistan, portugal, singapore, south korea, spain, sweden, switzerland and the united arab emirates, as well as taiwan, a self-governing democracy that beijing claims as part of a unified china. in south africa, a similar version of the virus has emerged, sharing one of the mutations seen in b.1.1.7., according to scientists who detected it. that variant, known as 501.v2, has been found in up to 90 percent of the samples whose genetic sequences have been analyzed in south africa since mid-november. the british authorities said they have detected two cases of the variant identified in south africa.

over the next year, large areas of the countryside became depopulated. besides registered and unregistered refugees who fled from their villages, the displaced included peasants who simply moved to another hamlet or area in a hamlet, or who moved to an open field, away from the clumps of trees and vegetation targeted by bombing and shelling. as an added precaution, they began to wear white clothing instead of the usual peasant black pajamas that americans had come to associate with the viet cong, to avoid getting killed. in addition, there were also temporary refugees who moved in or out of a village for a few weeks at a time, or who would come back to their land occasionally to salvage what they could from their orchards.

general suleimani was not a particularly elusive target. unlike bin laden or al-baghdadi, he moved about quite freely in a number of countries, frequently popping up meeting with iranian allies or visiting front-line positions in syria, iraq and lebanon. he traveled with an air of impunity. his fans distributed photographs of him on social media, and he occasionally gave interviews. one former senior american commander recalled once parking his military jet next to general suleimani's plane at the erbil airport in northern iraq.
rime abdel nabi, who teaches arabic at two public high schools, as well as at sorbonne university in paris, said public school principals were reluctant to open classes, saying, 'no, we don't have enough arabs here, or 'no, we don't want to attract arabs.'
the scale of the victory in uttar pradesh's legislative elections was all the more stunning because it followed mr. modi's politically risky decision to eliminate most of india's cash. the vote was seen as a referendum on the prime minister, who campaigned vigorously in recent days in uttar pradesh, which, with a population of more than 200 million, would be the world's sixth largest country if it were independent.
white house officials resign, with more expected to follow. the defections of former trump loyalists started earlier in the day, after a mob of his supporters gathered in washington on wednesday. credit... joseph prezioso/agence france-presse — getty images in the hours after president trump took to social media to openly condone the violence at the capitol, he found himself increasingly isolated as white house officials began submitting their resignations, with more expected to follow suit. stephanie grisham, the former white house press secretary who served as the chief of staff to melania trump, the first lady, submitted her resignation after the violent protests. ms. grisham has worked for the trumps since the 2016 campaign and is one of their longest-serving aides. rickie niceta, the white house social secretary, also said she was resigning, according to an administration official familiar with her plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. and sarah matthews, a deputy white house press secretary, also submitted her resignation, saying in a statement that she was deeply disturbed by what i saw today. more resignations were expected. mr. trump was strangely silent on wednesday night, as lawmakers on capitol hill reconvened to resume counting electoral votes and roundly denounce the violence. his twitter feed was suspended after he made baseless claims about election fraud and openly condoned the violence of his supporters. and he was isolated in the west wing, where the aides who did not quit on the spot also steered clear of him to avoid his line of fire.
he also guided the new york fed through the asian financial crisis in 1997 and the institution's preparations for guarding against a so-called y2k computer-driven market failure at the onset of the year 2000. he spent the last day, and night, of 1999 at fed headquarters to ensure there were no glitches.
but other believers contested those claims and appeared resigned to postponing their day of reckoning yet again.
the vast majority of the nation's 55 million independent workers — more than one-third of the country's work force — are creating income from a wide variety of sources. they're graphic designers and domestic workers, accountants and writers, adjunct professors and day laborers.
but it was an unusual admission from mr. gerecht, who has regularly criticized the president, dating to the 2016 campaign, when he was among the dozens of republican foreign policy insiders who added their names to a letter denouncing mr. trump as unfit to lead the nation and collectively came to be known as never trumpers.
this indicates that the key n501y mutation, which is found in the emerging u.k and south africa variants, does not create resistance to the pfizer-biontech vaccine induced immune responses, the companies said in a press release.
on thursday, afghan officials contested mr. trump's account — which was also at odds with the state department's office of the historian and historians, generally.
in direct, forceful language, mr. biden called the scenes of chaos in the halls of congress a dark moment in the nation's history, appealed for calm and made clear that he held mr. trump accountable for instigating violence that left members of both parties and allies around the world appalled.
but he also moderated those threats by leaving out the specifics. mr. kim did not explicitly say that he was formally lifting the test moratorium or that he was terminating diplomacy. instead, he said his efforts to expand his nuclear weapons capabilities could be adjusted depending on the u.s. future attitude.
david laude, a former senior vice provost in charge of student success at u.t., told me the school's culture was opposed to four-year graduation rates. but after a texas-size donnybrook that pitted gov. rick perry, who was fixated on cost-cutting, against the president at the time, william powers, a deal emerged in 2013. the texas board of regents approved a tuition increase, gave the university $12 million and agreed to invest in programs to help students succeed. the university had already begun drawing up plans to graduate more students on schedule, but mr. powers raised the stakes by pledging that 70 percent of the class of 2017 would graduate in four years.
all of the border things that we'll be building will be done right here in the good old usa by steel companies that were practically out of business when i came into office as president. and now, they're thriving. later, he said, the steel industry was almost dead.
your editorial is correct that a proposed state constitutional amendment would automatically restore voting rights to the vast majority of floridians who are disenfranchised because they are felons, but it is quite wrong in asserting that this is a pointless policy that is explicitly racist.
still, core bond funds' struggles have been unsettling. and with a strong-enough economy spurring the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, bond investors may need to reduce expectations.
i don't think it changes the larger analysis, mr. gerecht cautioned, arguing that mr. trump remained a major disappointment on foreign policy issues like his criticism of nato allies and his lack of support for western democratic values throughout the middle east. but, mr. gerecht added, on iran, which is the most important one in the middle east, he is getting that one more or less right.
postwar britain was, in collier's affectionate account, a society undergirded by a dense web of reciprocal obligations, which in turn gave rise to a strong sense of shared identity. a widespread belief that the fates of the cities and the provinces were tied together, and that the affluent and established had a stake in cultivating the talents of young strivers like himself, justified large increases in public investment. it also infused the sensibilities of many corporate executives, who tempered the pursuit of short-term profit with a concern for the long-term prosperity of the communities they served.
so reads a paragraph in an email sent on jan. 9, 2020, at 2:08 a.m. the author of the email was steve kenny, the senior editor for nights at the new york times; sui-lee wee and donald g. mcneil jr. are times reporters.
the best biology textbook in the 1950s, for example, would still not have the accuracy, depth and complexity of one published in 2017. a doctor who graduates today knows and learns many more techniques and medicines than someone who graduated years ago, mr. freeman said. and we don't really build that in.
i am very disappointed that this article described the shooting as a possible hate crime instead of calling it a possible terrorist attack. terrorist attacks by alt-right or white supremacists have consistently been downplayed relative to terrorist attacks by muslims. our journalists and politicians need to start treating them as equal evils. if our alt-right government doesn't want to treat this terrorist attack as a terrorist attack, that doesn't mean that the nytimes should do the same. jason dumelie, new york, n.y.
in the final chapter, i propose a series of steps that i believe we must take in order to safeguard the jewish future. we must change the nature of american jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. these changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. we must adopt a new, more positive, jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. but first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. the famed yiddisher cup (khop)---jewish head--is only half full: the typical jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of judaism. we must begin to fill the yiddisher cup with the kind of useful jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. to do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our jewish youth.
with donald trump in the white house and republicans in control of the senate, there was no chance of striking faircloth from the books. but a biden presidency with a democratic senate — or even a bare republican majority that hinges on a few persuadable moderates, like susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska — could offer an opportunity for a legacy-defining initiative.
but far more american voters are either jacksonians or jeffersonians. the jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, america retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and america's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (no blood for oil is the defining jeffersonian attitude toward all our middle eastern misadventures.) the jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (more rubble, less trouble is the essential jacksonian credo.) since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in washington, d.c., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize jacksonian or jeffersonian sentiment to achieve hamiltonian or wilsonian ends.
he was a champion and a fighter, she said. but my memories are of a father who had to live life with this daily reminder of how we had failed in terms of our health care. i don't want another little girl out there to have her father suffer a stroke that is debilitating and life-altering in that way.
facebook and twitter temporarily locked president trump's accounts this week after he inspired the rampage on the capitol, and they are considering permanent bans.
the deal, china's largest foreign takeover ever, is nearing completion after more than 15 stressful months during which its success often looked in doubt. while chemchina quickly amassed huge bridge loans so it could pay syngenta stockholders, it was less obvious what the longer-term funding structure would look like. the deal-hungry buyer already had a stretched balance sheet, limiting its own ability to contribute equity.
under the policy, detailed in articles in the times of london last week, four british women were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in somalia where, they said, they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. the women's families had sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.

in 2012, united's paying $34 million for a 29-year-old in the final year of his contract was considered the height of decadence. ferguson pressed for it, for once, because he did not care about resale value, or the club's policy of bringing in younger players. he wanted someone who would make an immediate impact, deliver instant success. he wanted to go out at the top. it was a short-term solution to a short-term problem.
credit... west virginia public broadcasting we're going in, he says, at one point turning the camera to show himself wearing a helmet. in a statement on facebook on wednesday evening, mr. evans said that he had traveled across the country to film many different events, and that earlier he had had the opportunity to film at another event in dc. i want to assure you all that i did not have any negative interactions with law enforcement nor did i participate in any destruction that may have occurred, he wrote. i was simply there as an independent member of the media to film history. the speaker of the west virginia house of delegates, roger hanshaw, said in a statement on wednesday night that he had not spoken to delegate evans about today's events, though he said he saw what was posted on social media. mr. hanshaw, a republican, added that storming government buildings and participating in a violent intentional disruption of one of our nation's most fundamental political institutions is a crime that should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. mr. evans was not the only republican state lawmaker drawn to washington to oppose the electoral college counting. a former pennsylvania legislator, rick saccone, posted an image on social media of himself and a current state senator, doug mastriano, who led a panel last year airing baseless claims of voter fraud in pennsylvania, and is a regular guest on the conservative television station newsmax.
mr. russo said mr. biden would be transparent about his finances if he ran. he will make available his tax returns, financial interests and other information that used to be — and should once again become — commonplace, he said, referring to mr. trump's defiance of a four-decade tradition of voluntary disclosure by presidents and many candidates.
mr. biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat mr. trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that mr. biden was making racist remarks. in fact he was emphasizing the need to change our culture around violence toward women.
there must be laws that limit self-dealing, executive privilege, sale of presidential pardons, and claims of absolute immunity from investigation and prosecution.
coax people who had dropped out of the labor force to look for work.
this endeavor took human-centered design as its starting point, and schleuning's use of smushy is appropriate. human-centered design means designing for people by first understanding what they actually need. in the case of the v.a., not having the input of staff members and the veterans themselves would have made this project untenable.
in 2016, mr. xi put mr. luo in charge of cleaning up shanxi province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. mr. luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.
amber schleuning, deputy director of the v.a. center for innovation and a fourth-generation veteran, never thought she'd work at the v.a. but she began to hear from others she served with, her dad (also a veteran) and his friends about the problems they were having interacting with the system.

during the 2018 cycle, mr. biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. at a book-related talk in missoula, mont., in early december, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself the most qualified person in the country to be president.
saudi arabia and russia split on oil production quotas. riyadh will cut its target by one million barrels, while moscow will modestly increase its target. the changes, which will ultimately lead to a reduction in the global oil supply, reflect continued tensions among top petroleum producers.
successful fund-raising is one of the messages that you want to have available to you as a candidate in iowa, because it's an indicator of the ability to sustain a campaign as long as is necessary, said jerry crawford, who has led several democrats' iowa operations.

andrew j. bacevich, a trenchant critic of american foreign policy and the author of several studies of international affairs, begins his latest book, the age of illusions, with a quote from harry angstrom, the protagonist of john updike's rabbit novels. without the cold war, angstrom asked, what's the point of being an american?
new york state law does not explicitly forbid sexual contact between police officers and people in their custody, though it forbids such conduct by correction and parole officers. the new york state assembly last week passed legislation to prevent police officers from escaping legal consequences of an alleged sexual assault by saying arrestees consented, and the state senate is now considering the same measure. the new york city council is also considering legislation that would make it a misdemeanor crime for police officers to have sexual contact with people in custody.
for korean new yorkers of a certain age, there's a good chance they've heard the phrase let's go to circle (or seokeul-e gaja in korean). the raucous club circle has played an outsize role among young korean-americans for 10 years, though it was largely unknown outside of asian-american circles.
it's a very weird and conflicted feeling, said jared bernstein of the center on budget and policy priorities, who worked in the obama white house. on some level i should be happy, and i am sort of happy right now, but with some nontrivial caveats.

now, however, mr. logan says he — and by extension, the 6,000 members of the council of school supervisors and administrators — has lost confidence in the de blasio administration. in a column to be published in the union's newsletter this month, mr. logan writes of the education department, sadly, in the timeworn tradition of the d.o.e., there are so many cooks running around in the kitchen, the chefs don't know what kind of dish they're concocting. so many different mandates have been thrown at these schools, he writes, that all we have is a recipe for disaster.

striking down faircloth, though, is worth a fight. the amendment was passed in 1998, when republicans controlled congress and president bill clinton had soured on public housing. unfairly characterized as mere dens of sin and vice — and increasingly neglected as whites moved out and poorer, nonwhite residents moved in — public housing was largely viewed as a liberal failure, with democrats and republicans both cheering on its destruction. instead, politicians argued that section 8 housing vouchers were sufficient, even though landlords were able to discriminate against tenants who received such federal housing assistance.
the recent price data give little hint that this undershooting of our target will end any time soon, ms. brainard said of inflation at the time, according to the transcript. that, paired with risks from a slowdown overseas, made her place somewhat greater weight on the possible regret associated with tightening too early than on the possible regret associated with waiting a little longer.
to those who say that jewish fund-raising, charity, and defense organizations are the answer, i say, work on, raise money, build buildings, elect officers, bestow honors, monitor anti-semitism, support israel. but do not count on it to ensure the jewish future, because maybe the next generation will not be as attracted to these institutions as the post-holocaust generation was.
but a report published by u.s. pirg's education fund affiliate, examining relief given by the 10 top insurers in each state, found that most hadn't given customers more than half of one month's premium. over all, they were pretty stingy, ms. murray said.
democrats stepped up their criticism of intelligence that the administration provided immediately after the drone strike last week that killed maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the leader of iran's islamic revolutionary guards corps. the administration's formal notification to congress, which remains classified, provided no information on future threats or the imminent attack, officials who have read it said.
right. because in the minds of u.s. officials, suleimani is very much responsible for those actions.
it is a truth too seldom acknowledged that books mark their authors for life. authors, of course, mark the completion of their books: a party, a bauble, for the lucky few, a check. yet the wages of a book go deeper than royalties or celebration. so it was that on a saturday morning last year, just shy of my 54th birthday, i found myself at a trendy tattoo parlor on the lower east side, waiting for my artist to arrive. the plan: she would ink onto my forearm a detail from a painting by the boston-born artist john singleton copley, whose biography i had recently written. i spent the better part of a decade in the close company of that fascinating, vexing man, dead some 200 years yet far more alive to me than most of my neighbors. now he and i were both moving on. a remembrance seemed in order. a life should leave / deep tracks, as the poet kay ryan writes.
grounded by the pandemic, our correspondent discovers the world in her kitchen in bangkok. shoppers peruse the longan fruit for sale at the talaad thai wholesale market in bangkok, thailand. credit... amanda mustard for the new york times bangkok — of all the senses, taste, inextricably linked to smell to awaken flavors, is the perhaps most evocative in its ability to conjure memories of time and place. i am fortunate to have roamed the world, both for work and play, and my kitchen holds the bounty of this wandering, letting me relive a globe-trotting that has halted with the pandemic. my freezer is packed with sumac from istanbul, sichuan peppercorn from chengdu and chai masala from jodhpur. the cupboard has orange flower water from malta, sardines from portugal, hot sauce from belize and first flush tea from sri lanka. and that's not even taking into consideration the plenitude of thailand, a country of 70 million people who can enjoy multiple types of eggplant and innumerable varieties of shrimp paste. if we cannot physically travel, at least my family can do so with each meal, and we are lucky to be able to explore continents at the table.
even if there is a recognition that mr. trump's tweets may be largely intended to let off steam or reassure his domestic base, there is an increasing sense that the credibility of the administration, and the presidency itself, is being eroded.
another former ambassador, eric rubin, who was the chief envoy to bulgaria under mr. obama and mr. trump, and is now the president of the union that represents career diplomats, noted that the world is watching the transition process — in part to see if the united states will return to an era of domestic politics ending at the water's edge. that has been a mantra of american foreign policy for much of the last 75 years.
any inclination to warmly welcome the gentlemen of muirfield into the 21st century is tempered by the fact that 123 members — even confronted with a boycott of their storied course by the royal and ancient, the organizer of the british open — stubbornly thumbed their noses at what passes for progress in the rest of the civilized world by voting against admitting women.
in seeking to influence the executive branch, the president is not without help. he relies on what the political scientist john hart called the presidential branch — which consists of almost 2,000 staff members, several hundred under the white house proper and the rest in a variety of management organizations (national security council, council of economic advisers, office of management and budget) within the executive office of the president.

chinese officials appear set to offer a mix of concessions, including reducing some tariffs on american goods, as they try to defuse trade tensions ahead of a march 2 deadline, when tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. an american delegation of midlevel trade officials will begin two days of talks with their counterparts on monday in beijing, led by jeffrey gerrish, the deputy united states trade representative, and david malpass, the treasury department's under secretary for international affairs.
i think it's difficult for most people in the united states and outside of iran, and perhaps the region, to grasp the unique place and role that general suleimani played in iran and in regional politics. he was singlehandedly the most revered and influential character in iran.
yet when mr. bush received his yale diploma in 1968, he had third-rate grades, second-rate accomplishments and no firm career prospects. there was, however, one area where he had excelled: he had a huge number of very close friends, and long after course grades were forgotten, those friends would still stand by him, reach into their pockets for him and help propel him into politics.
the additional aid, of €95 million, has not been previously reported, and is a jarring example of the quandary facing the european union as it scrambles to drastically curb migration.
there have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control, but only glancing disagreements about the role of the united states abroad and the proper way to resolve american military engagements in the middle east and central asia.
republicans have often worried out loud about the deficit while passing policies that will have the effect of expanding it. for instance, tax cuts that cleared congress earlier in mr. trump's administration were expected to increase the deficit by $1.9 trillion in the decade through 2028, based on a congressional budget office analysis.

a jew today can live in any neighborhood, even those that were formerly restricted. jews live alongside white anglo-saxon protestants in the most exclusive neighborhoods throughout the country--grosse pointe, greenwich, fifth avenue, beacon hill. and they have been welcomed into the best families, including the roosevelts, kennedys, cuomos, and rockefellers. economically, socially, and politically, we have become the new wasps, as a perusal of the sponsor list of any major charitable or cultural event will show. indeed, terms such as j.a.s.p. (jewish anglo-saxon protestant) and w.a.s.h. (white anglo-saxon hebrew) have become current in some circles to denote the full social acceptance that jews increasingly enjoy.
this is the united states of america, and this is what we have to go through, because trump has called on homegrown terrorists to come to the capitol and invalidate people's votes. lawmakers were determined to resume their work in the capitol on wednesday night, if possible, mr. crow said. we want to go back and finish the business of the people to show that we are a democracy, and that the government is stronger than any mob, he said. eric schmitt, nicholas fandos and
help me understand this idea, because the strategy that you have described over the past decade of violence and provocation that suleimani oversaw and he came to personify, it doesn't feel protective. why did it feel that way to iranians in a way that the u.s. might not have understood?
until now, the main person doing any explaining since the strike on general suleimani has been mr. pompeo. vice president mike pence is scheduled to give a speech on monday describing the administration's iran policy at the foundation for defense of democracies, a group that has led opposition to the tehran government.
the letter from ms. pelosi came as momentum for impeachment was rapidly growing on friday among rank-and-file democrats across the party's ideological spectrum, and a handful of republicans offered potential support. representative katherine clark of massachusetts, the no. 4 democrat, said that if vice president mike pence would not invoke the 25th amendment to forcibly relieve mr. trump of his duties, house democrats were prepared to act on impeachment by the middle of next week. but in a noon phone call, some others cautioned that democrats needed to pause to consider the implications, and ms. pelosi told her colleagues she planned to speak to president-elect joseph r. biden jr. about the matter later on friday afternoon. during an appearance in wilmington, del., on friday, mr. biden did not weigh in on plans to impeach mr. trump, saying, what the congress decides to do is for them to decide. but mr. biden had harsh words for mr. trump. he has exceeded even my worst notions about him, he said. he's been an embarrassment for the country. and he added, he's not worthy to hold the office. an aide to ms. pelosi said that she still had not heard from mr. pence, despite putting intense public pressure on him to act. but mr. pence was said to be opposed to doing so, and she was making plans to move ahead.
mr. trump reinforced his solidarity with the movement by sending a twitter post saying, the #marchforlife is so important. to all of you marching — you have my full support!

mr. netanyahu would probably be the first to admit that history has been unkind to inexperienced israeli leaders. there are calmer countries, in which one can have less experience and learn on the job. there are countries that don't have an array of enemies seeking their destruction, that aren't situated in a treacherous region and that don't face a constant barrage of crises. and then there is israel. here, the prime minister must hit the ground running or face calamity.
jan. 5, 2021, 11:44 p.m. et jan. 5, 2021, 11:44 p.m. et large numbers of votes in dekalb county arrive in the democrats' column. a polling location in dekalb county. the county, which includes part of atlanta, is one of the largest in georgia and is heavily democratic. credit... audra melton for the new york times dekalb county, a democratic stronghold near atlanta, just reported a large batch of votes, moving the rev. raphael warnock into the lead over senator kelly loeffler and putting jon ossoff a fraction of a percentage point behind david perdue. mr. warnock is now ahead by about 35,000 votes, or over three-quarters of a percentage point, while mr. ossoff trails by several hundred votes. he is likely to move ahead of mr. perdue as more ballots are counted. the latest batch — more than 150,000 votes — was a majority of the roughly 171,000 early votes that georgia election officials had said remained to be counted in dekalb county. (there was, briefly, some confusion when a county official told cnn that the number was 117,000; a top state election official, gabriel sterling, subsequently confirmed that the county official had accidentally transposed the 1 and the 7.) in addition to the roughly 19,000 early votes now remaining, mr. sterling said dekalb county still had about 12,000 election day votes left to count. he also said there were roughly 7,000 early votes left in coffee county, which is heavily republican.
that variant has been in the united states for three months and also accounts for fewer than 0.5 percent of cases, so it is unlikely to be more contagious than other variants, according to a c.d.c. scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. all viruses evolve, and the coronavirus is no different. based on scientific understanding of viruses, it is highly likely there are many variants evolving simultaneously across the globe, mr. mcdonald, of the c.d.c., said. however, it could take weeks or months to identify if there is a single variant of the virus that causes covid-19 fueling the surge in the united states similar to the surge in the united kingdom. carl zimmer contributed reporting from new haven and noah weiland from washington d.c. (correction: jan. 9, 2021 — an earlier version of this article misidentified the news outlet that first published the report of a possible new variant. it was cnn, not cnbc.)

it is true that yale did not explode until after the class of 1968 had graduated. but it is very odd to describe yale in 1967-68 as a fairly placid period, as mr. bush does.

lawmakers fear a coronavirus outbreak after sharing close quarters in lockdown. rep. susan wild, democrat of pennsylvania, on the floor of the house early thursday debating objections to confirming the electoral college vote from pennsylvania. credit... house television, via associated press a day after members of congress were relocated to secure locations as a mob of trump supporters stormed the capitol, raising fears about widespread transmission of the coronavirus, a house member revealed on thursday that he had tested positive for the virus. representative jake laturner, republican of kansas, announced on twitter — hours after sharing space with colleagues on the house floor throughout a late-night session to confirm president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s electoral college victory — that he had received a positive test, prompting further concern that the virus might have spread more widely. while in lockdown on wednesday, representative susan wild, democrat of pennsylvania, told cbs news by phone that about half of the people sheltering in the secure location in the capitol complex had refused to wear masks, even though masks were made available. when asked which lawmakers had declined to cover their faces, ms. wild said they had been people from the republican delegation. it's what i would call a covid superspreader event, she said. it's exactly the kind of situation that we've been told by the medical doctors not to be in, you know — close proximity — especially with people who aren't wearing masks.

trump replaces the top federal prosecutor in atlanta, who quit abruptly. bobby christine, right, the u.s. attorney for the southern district of georgia, will also serve as the acting u.s. attorney for the northern district. credit... sean rayford/getty images president trump ordered a u.s. attorney in southern georgia to serve simultaneously as the top federal prosecutor in atlanta, the justice department announced on tuesday, a day after the official previously in the atlanta post left abruptly after mr. trump pressed georgia elections officials on unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud there. the acting u.s. attorney, bobby christine, announced his role in a news release, saying that he would serve, effective immediately, as u.s. attorney in both the southern and northern districts of georgia. on january 4, 2021, by written order of the president, bobby was named acting u.s. attorney for the northern district of georgia, the news release said. mr. trump nominated mr. christine and his predecessor in atlanta, byung pak, to serve as u.s. attorneys in 2017. mr. pak said in a short email to his office on monday that he was resigning immediately because of unforeseen circumstances, and his spokesman gave no further explanation. a spokesman for the justice department in washington did not respond to an email seeking comment on whether the acting attorney general, jeffrey a. rosen, had asked mr. pak to leave or mr. christine to oversee the atlanta office.
a new labor department rule would classify gig workers as contractors. construction is among the industries that may be affected by a labor department rule on criteria for employee status. credit... james tensuan for the new york times the labor department on wednesday released the final version of a rule that could classify millions of workers in industries like construction, cleaning and the gig economy as contractors rather than employees, another step under the trump administration toward endorsing the business practices of companies like uber and lyft. companies don't have to pay contractors a minimum wage or overtime and don't have to pay a share of contractors' social security taxes or contribute to unemployment insurance on their behalf. by contrast, companies that hire employees must provide them with those benefits and protections, which can raise labor costs 20 to 30 percent, according to estimates from industry officials. this rule brings long-needed clarity for american workers and employers, the labor secretary, eugene scalia, said in a statement, adding that the rule makes it easier to identify legitimate employees while recognizing and respecting the entrepreneurial spirit of workers who choose to pursue the freedom associated with being an independent contractor. the rule is scheduled to take effect on march 8, which will allow the incoming biden administration to postpone it and perhaps set it aside.

on friday, public health england released a new study of b.1.1.7 in which researchers estimated that the variant is 30 to 50 percent more transmissible than other forms of the virus. the viral lineage leading to b.1.1.7 has accumulated 23 mutations. of particular concern to scientists are eight mutations that affect the gene for a protein called spike on the surface of coronaviruses. that's because the viruses use the spike protein to grab onto human cells. it's possible that one or more of them help b.1.1.7 invade cells more successfully. one of these mutations, known as n501y, is particularly worrisome. experiments have demonstrated that it enables the virus to bind to cells more tightly. and it has also arisen in other lineages of the coronavirus, including a variant identified in south africa in december. that variant, called b.1.351, rapidly spread through the country, and has spread to a dozen other countries so far. researchers at the university of texas medical branch ran an experiment to see if the pfizer-biontech vaccine worked against viruses with the n501y mutation. they found that in cells in the lab, the mutant virus could not infect human cells mixed with antibodies from vaccinated people. the antibodies latched onto the coronaviruses and blocked them from grabbing into cells. despite the n501y mutation, the experiment showed, the vaccine-generated antibodies were still able to latch onto the viruses.

g.m. said auto sales fell in 2020 but were up in the final three months of the year. sales of chevrolets and other makes in the fourth quarter offset a 10 percent drop in sales of buicks, general motors reported on tuesday. credit... david zalubowski/associated press general motors said its vehicle sales in the united states fell 12 percent in 2020, but increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, a hopeful sign for the auto industry at the end of a difficult year. the automaker reported solid performances from its chevrolet, gmc and cadillac brands in the final three months of the year. they offset a 10 percent drop in sales of buick vehicles. overall, g.m. sold 2.5 million cars and light trucks in 2020, down from nearly 2.9 million a year earlier. auto sales fell sharply last spring as consumers stayed away from dealerships because of the coronavirus pandemic. g.m. and other automakers were forced to halt production for most of the second quarter when government officials forced many businesses to shut down to stop the spread of the virus. but sales rebounded once factories restarted in part because of pent-up demand for cars and trucks. some americans bought cars in order to avoid mass transit and shared rides. it helped that people had more disposable income because they were spending less on travel, dining and entertainment. g.m. said its strong sales momentum continued through the end of the year.

in chapters 2, 3, and 4, i develop my thesis that the nature of anti-semitism is changing in fundamental and important ways: mainstream anti-semitism--as traditionally practiced by churches, states, corporations, universities, and other elite institutions--is coming to an end; today's jew-haters are largely marginalized and powerless. this change means that although anti-semitism persists and must continue to be monitored, it has far less daily impact on the lives of american jews than in the past. thus we must define our jewish identity in different and more positive ways than we did the past.

twitter first attached a warning label to the tweet that said it made a disputed claim about election fraud before removing the tweet atogether, claiming it violated the twitter rules. in a follow-up message, twitter said it was suspending the president's twitter feed for 12 hours — and possibly more if he did not delete his message — and threatened a permanent suspension if mr. trump violated its rules in the future. in doing so, the platform took away the president's favorite method of communicating with his supporters directly, one he has used often since the election to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. then, around 8:30 p.m. wednesday night, a facebook spokesman said officials had identified two policy violations against president trump's page, and as a result, would block him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. even as former administration officials and democratic leaders called on the president to tell his supporters to go home, mr. trump for hours did little to discourage them from storming the building. instead, he issued two perfunctory tweets in which he asked them merely to remain peaceful. remember, we are the party of law & order — respect the law and our great men and women in blue, he wrote, after shocking scenes of broken windows and waving confederate flags in the capitol had been playing on television for hours.

though routine veterinary visits might cost pet owners only a couple of hundred dollars per year, a serious condition can be very expensive. a dog's kidney transplant can run $25,000, and a cat's cancer treatment can cost $10,000 or more. even if such high costs are extremely rare, it is not as uncommon for a pet owner to encounter a $2,000 to $4,000 bill at some point, particularly near the end of a pet's life.

what's interesting about mr. trump's digital efforts is that even though he is always online, he is not extremely online. rather than fully engaging with the platforms and employing their nifty audio and video tools, he has stuck to text, using his own set of locutions and his own distinctive voice. while at first this made him seem, to many supporters at least, more authentic than the average politician, it is now making him look more and more like a giant cartoon bobblehead. the internet is not making him more of a person.

read the draft of a leading article of impeachment against trump. as congress prepared to certify the victory of his successor on wednesday, president trump railed against the election and helped set in motion hours of violence. credit... pete marovich for the new york times a draft copy of an article of impeachment against president trump circulating on friday charges him with incitement of insurrection, saying that the president had made statements that encouraged his supporters to commit violence against the government of the united states. incited by president trump, a mob unlawfully breached the capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced members of congress and the vice president, interfered with the joint session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results, and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts, reads the draft, which was obtained by the new york times. another similar set of articles was also circulating among house democrats, but the one drafted by representatives david cicilline of rhode island, jamie raskin of maryland and ted lieu of california had garnered the most support. the four-page document also cites a pattern of behavior leading up to this week's riot, pointing to mr. trump's efforts to subvert the results of a free and fair election, including his call last week pressuring a top georgia election official to find him more votes.
the president faces a year in which a bitterly divided congress and a swirling russia scandal could rob him of any high-profile legislative successes. he is sure to play up the benefits of the landmark tax cuts that he helped push through last year, as he did at the white house on wednesday in an appearance with families who will benefit from the plan. but his proposal for a $1.5 trillion building program to fix the nation's roads, bridges, airports and other structures generated little enthusiasm, and he offered few other major concrete ideas for legislation.
in the decades since 1975, all three major interpretations have persisted. some writers and historians have embraced president ronald reagan's view that the war was a noble cause that might have been won. that position has failed to persuade most specialists in the field, in large part because it greatly exaggerates the military and political virtues and success of the united states and the government of south vietnam. it also falls short because it depends on counterfactual claims that victory would have been achieved if only the united states had extended its support for diem (instead of greenlighting his overthrow), or tried a different military strategy, or done a better job winning hearts and minds. however, the war as it was actually conducted by the united states and its allies was a disaster by every measure.
the thesis of this book is that the long epoch of jewish persecution is finally coming to an end and that a new age of internal dangers to the jewish people is on the horizon. institutional anti-semitism is on its last legs as governments, churches, universities, and businesses embrace jews. no jew today needs to convert in order to become a professor, a banker, or a corporate ceo. although anti-semitism persists in many quarters, today's overt anti-semites--the skinheads, militias, holocaust deniers, and farrakhan followers--have become marginalized. they continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most jews, as anti-semites in previous generations did. today's marginalized anti-semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry. we no longer look up to anti-semites as the elites in our society who determine our fate. we look down on anti-semites as the dregs of our society who make lots of noise but little difference.

but alongside the civil war interpretation, a more radical critique developed — the view that america's enemy in vietnam was engaged in a long-term war for national liberation and independence, first from the french and then the united states. according to this position, the war was best understood not as a cold war struggle between east and west, or a vietnamese civil war, but as an anticolonial struggle, similar to dozens of others that erupted throughout the third world in the wake of world war ii. when the french were defeated by vietnamese revolutionaries (despite enormous american support), the united states stepped in directly to wage a counterrevolutionary war against an enemy determined to achieve full and final independence from foreign control.

so general suleimani was instrumental in elevating iran's strategy in the region through the proxy militia groups that it had created. and he started in lebanon, where iran had already created two shia militia groups, amal al-islami and hezbollah, and he helped them in their fight with israeli soldiers that were occupying lebanon, and later on in the battles that hezbollah and lebanon fought. general suleimani also becomes very involved with palestinian militant groups — hamas, islamic jihad — who also see an alliance between their ideologies and islamic republic of iran.
it's no mere coincidence that jeffrey r. brown, the dean of the gies college of business, at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, is also a scholar of risk management. at his first faculty meeting four years ago, brown fretted that his school had become, like many american universities, overly dependent on a single source of money — roughly a fifth of tuition revenue came from chinese students. i saw our reliance on china as a risk, says brown, noting that 800 or so of the university's nearly 5,800 chinese students attend the business school. at the time, i was concerned that china could pull the plug on students coming to america. but then the u.s. political landscape shifted, and we were vulnerable to changing visa and immigration policies here, too. both were threats we could not control.

as the d.c. police clear the capitol grounds, the mayor extends a public emergency. pro-trump supporters clashed with police officers and national guard troops on wednesday, as the authorities worked to remove them from the capitol. credit... kenny holston for the new york times the mayor of washington extended a public emergency on wednesday night as the local police worked to secure the area around the capitol. everyone needs to clear the capitol ground and remove themselves back to their homes states, or wherever they're staying, and let the police do their jobs, mayor muriel bowser told reporters late wednesday evening. ms. bowser also issued an order extending the district of columbia's public emergency for 15 days. the order said that people who came to washington for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction had fired bricks, bricks, bottles, guns and chemical irritants. their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the capitol, it said. a number of regional police departments, as well as the national guard, helped the metropolitan police department establish a perimeter around the capitol to help enforce an overnight curfew that took effect at 6 p.m., said robert j. contee, the department's chief. chief contee added that some of the capitol police officers who were injured during demonstrations on wednesday were still on duty. although they are injured, they are still working — they're working very hard to regain control of the capitol, he said.

what i expect people will find is that the algorithms are primarily exposing the desires of humanity itself, for better or worse. this is a sugar, salt, fat problem. the book of that name tells a story ostensibly about food but in reality about the limited effectiveness of corporate paternalism. a while ago kraft foods had a leader who tried to reduce the sugar they sold in the interest of consumer health. but customers wanted sugar. so instead he just ended up reducing kraft market share. health outcomes didn't improve. that ceo lost his job. the new ceo introduced quadruple stuffed oreos and the company returned to grace. giving people tools to make their own decisions is good but trying to force decisions upon them rarely works (for them or for you).

several such councils disbanded after mr. trump declined in 2017 to condemn violence by white supremacists in charlottesville, va., and said there were very fine people and blame on both sides. with the president's increasing efforts to subvert the election, organizations have grown bolder. on monday, for example, 170 business leaders signed their names to a statement, organized by the business advocacy organization partnership for new york city, urging congress to certify the result of the presidential election, though some prominent members were missing. on wednesday, as a mob stormed the capitol, organizations not known for vocal statements seemed to no longer worry about the political ramifications of speaking up against mr. trump. the research group high frequency economics suspended regular publication of its research notes for the first time since the sept. 11, 2001, attacks and sent a note to its clients: we at high frequency economics are disgusted by the role of the president of the united states in inciting this riot, and we are saddened that he cannot find the character to stand up in front of the mob he has created, quell the violence and send everyone home. and the business roundtable, a group of chief executives, including mr. dimon, from some of the nation's largest companies, was direct as to the cause of the violence. the chaos unfolding in the nation's capital is the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election, the group said. the country deserves better.

the big dip in mortality shown in the trial of about 800 patients has caught some experts by surprise. other studies testing the effects of tocilizumab and sarilumab have ended in disappointment, showing little to no benefit in people hospitalized for covid-19. because all treatment trials are run with their own quirks and patient populations, it's difficult to compare across different studies, said dr. emma kaplan-lewis, an infectious-disease physician at nyc health + hospitals who has helped to conduct trials on tocilizumab, including one that showed no improvement in patient survival. she was not involved in the new study. my general impression is that tocilizumab and sarilumab do work for some patients, dr. kaplan-lewis added. but there is a sweet spot — it's not for everybody, at all times. while many treatments for covid-19 target the coronavirus itself, drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab work to quiet the immune system which, when triggered by an infection, can overreact and start to destroy the body's own tissues. this immunological friendly fire is thought to fan the flames of many of the most serious cases of covid-19. although the new study has not yet been vetted by experts for formal publication, its findings were compelling enough to prompt a shift in guidance in britain, where officials have partnered with roche, a manufacturer of tocilizumab, to keep hospitals stocked with the drug.

second, mr. bush is determinedly nonintellectual. he never seems to want to play with ideas and hold them up to the light; he drops names like nolan ryan, not kierkegaard.
so last week, i drove out to raymond island in the southeastern part of the country to meet a woman named susan pulis, who's been going to great lengths to save these animals whose lives and habitats are being destroyed. and i show up to this house on the island. susie's staying at a friend's place. the house is in disarray. her daughter's there. her friend's there. there's a lot of things going on, kind of a manic energy. and there's this smell of hay and animals. and i go in and have a look in the living room, and there are all these joeys, baby kangaroos.
in just a few decades, china has gone from a nation plagued by food shortages to one buffeted by soaring obesity and chronic diseases tied to poor diet. more than 42 percent of adults in china are overweight or obese, according to chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. in chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.
since coming to power in late 2012, mr. xi has warned taiwan against any shift toward independence and repeatedly met with taiwanese politicians from the kuomintang, the party that ruled china before the communist party and that now favors closer ties with beijing. but mr. xi's address was his first major speech as president devoted to taiwan, said bonnie s. glaser, an expert on chinese foreign policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington.

many jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. the story about professor daniel chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. chwolson, a russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from judaism to russian orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-semitism. this led a jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: out of conviction, the great man said. what conviction? his jewish friend inquired. chwolson responded: out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in st. petersburg than a hebrew school teacher in shklop. yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most jews resisted it. clearly, those jews--who sacrificed so much--remained jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. more than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. there are substantive principles that jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. for jews who define their jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: it is god's will. for the large number of jews who are skeptical about being god's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. it is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many jews, their jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.
i've been asked this question a lot in the last two weeks by people planning trips to krakow, where i've lived for 17 years after growing up in new york and then spending seven years in israel. they are worried about the holocaust bill recently passed by the polish government and the war of words that erupted in response on the international diplomatic level, as well as among the polish public and the global jewish community.
you trust your vet as you would trust your doctor to do what is best, especially when an emotional decision is being made. both human and pet health care are accompanied by strong emotions, making it hard to rationally weigh the value of options. moreover, the need for care, whether it is for a pet or a human, is difficult to predict and often urgent, again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals.

covid-19 has deepened the challenges of adopting through the foster care system. floyd scott at home in the dalles, ore., where he lives with his adoptive family along with his siblings, mesha and jermain. credit... michael hanson for the new york times the last step in the long journey to adopt a child through the foster care system is the courtroom finalization. it's traditionally provided an important opportunity for loved ones to gather and pose for pictures as a judge blesses the creation of a new forever family with a smack of the gavel. but, like so many other things in the covid-19 era, this tradition has gone virtual. we finalized our adoption over the phone, said celeste scott, who last may adopted her three youngest children — who were 4, 5 and 6 when they first came to live with her in the spring of 2019. it was kind of anticlimactic. still, scott, of the dalles, ore., knows she is fortunate to have finalized the adoptions at all. if she lived elsewhere in the country, she could very well still be waiting. the pandemic has created new challenges in the foster care system and worsened old ones — creating delays in placements and adoptions and forcing some older youth to exit the system amid a public health and economic crisis. the child welfare system is extremely complex and can vary widely by state, and even by county, said celeste bodner, executive director and founder of fosterclub, an advocacy organization for foster youth.

so australia has always had this really intimate relationship with coal. we're the world's largest exporter of it. most of it gets sent to growing economies in asia. the government is highly supported by the coal industry, and both parties take donations from the coal industry. so there's this intimate connection between coal and government in australia. it's a part of our identity and has been for a long time. but increasingly, there's this climate war growing in australia, where, because we're one of the most vulnerable developed nations to the impacts of climate change, people are increasingly growing tired of this connection to coal.
she would return each day with a car filled with food — fresh vegetables, packaged meals, bread, frosted cakes — and keep just enough for her family and then take the rest to her needy neighbors. i spent two days with ms. cazimero and her family over the summer, the first stop on a cross-country trip to chronicle the crisis of food insecurity unleashed by the pandemic. by the time fall arrived, ms. cazimero decided even that wasn't enough. so she and her mother and brother, with money from the sale of her mother's house, leased a 5,000-square-foot space that she turned into a co-op for local business owners who had lost their stores, or individuals who had lost their jobs, to set up shop. junktion 101 was born, with some 30 stalls selling everything from clothing to handicrafts to antiques to home goods. and she started her own food distribution operation, collecting donations and buying food with some of the proceeds from the co-op. the venture soon attracted the attention of the local news media, and before she knew it people were lining up. just like how you and i waited in line? she reminded me. well, people wait in line now, and i get to hand them the box. for the holidays, she organized turkey dinners for families and a toy drive for children, even as there were fewer gifts under the tree in her own house.
mr. brewster, who has represented a region outside pittsburgh for a decade, defeated nicole ziccarelli, a republican, by 69 votes. she is challenging the results in federal court. at issue are several hundred mail ballots that did not have a handwritten date on their outer envelopes. ms. ziccarelli lost a challenge in state court. jake corman, the president pro tem of the state senate and a republican, told reporters on monday that his party believed it had to wait for the outcome of the legal challenge before filling the seat. our goal is to get it right, not get it fast, he said. but democrats characterized it as a naked power grab. this idea of having one party decide who is the real victor is a dangerous precedent we're seeing played out on the national stage, mr. fetterman said. jennifer kocher, a spokeswoman for the senate republicans, accused democrats of creating chaos. today, the order and decorum of the senate were hijacked by lt. gov. john fetterman and members of the senate democrat caucus, who failed to adhere to senate rules, she said.
mr. trump was ready to aggressively attack a democratic field he and his advisers viewed as weak across the board. few if any of the president's top campaign aides were looking to change the channel.
the drone strike came at a charged time for mr. trump, who faces a senate trial after being impeached by the house largely along party lines last month for abuse of power and obstruction of congress. while advisers insisted politics had nothing to do with the decision, the timing was bound to raise questions in an era marked by deep suspicion across party lines.
for example, there's been a striking shift in how corporations see themselves. in normal times, corporations serve a lot of stakeholders — customers, employees, the towns in which they are located. but these days corporations see themselves as serving one purpose and one stakeholder — maximizing shareholder value. activist investors demand that every company ruthlessly cut the cost of its employees and ruthlessly screw its hometown if it will raise the short-term stock price.
this remarkable story is all too typical of how so many jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about jewish survival. without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be jewish. we need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our jewishness. the chosen people must be denied choices if judaism is to survive. if jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.

scientists know little about what causes anosmia or how to cure it. but cases are piling up as the coronavirus sweeps across the world; by some estimates, the pandemic may leave millions with a permanent loss of smell and taste. the prospect has set off an urgent scramble among researchers to learn more about why patients are losing these senses, and how to help them. many sufferers describe the condition as extremely upsetting, even debilitating, all the more so because it is invisible to others. i feel alien from myself, one sufferer wrote in facebook group for covid patients with anosmia. it's also kind of a loneliness in the world. like a part of me is missing, as i can no longer smell and experience the emotions of everyday basic living. loss of smell is a risk factor for anxiety and depression, so the implications of widespread anosmia deeply trouble mental health experts. researchers have found that olfactory dysfunction often precedes social deficits in schizophrenia, and social withdrawal even in healthy individuals. and many people who can't smell will lose their appetites, putting them at risk of nutritional deficits and unintended weight loss. from a public health perspective, this is really important, dr. datta said. if you think worldwide about the number of people with covid, even if only 10 percent have a more prolonged smell loss, we're talking about potentially millions of people.

he had, however, made it clear in recent months both to zorc and hans-joachim watzke, dortmund's chief executive, that he did not intend to extend his contract — due to expire in 2020 — at signal iduna park. instead, he had set his heart on moving to england, something related to his american background, according to zorc. against that background, we have decided to accept an extremely lucrative bid from chelsea, zorc said.
mr. trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
history gives little guide on this question, but michael j. gerhardt, a constitutional scholar at the university of north carolina who testified in the last impeachment proceedings, wrote on friday that he saw no reason congress could not proceed. it would make no sense for former officials, or ones who step down just in time, to escape that remedial mechanism, he wrote. it should accordingly go without saying that if an impeachment begins when an individual is in office, the process may surely continue after they resign or otherwise depart. the senate could vote to bar mr. trump from ever holding office again. the constitution says that, if the house impeaches and the senate convicts, the senate can consider disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the united states. this would prevent mr. trump from running for president again in 2024, and could be an appealing prospect not just to democrats but to many republicans who are eyeing their own runs.
from the state's point of view, subsidies have translated into real economic progress. a spokesman for the governor said the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent statewide in november, its lowest level since november 2007, and that new york state had added 759,300 private jobs since mr. cuomo took office. in central new york, the region around syracuse, unemployment has fallen from 8.3 percent before mr. cuomo took office to 4.9 percent in november, according to figures provided by the governor's office. the region has added 9,300 private jobs in the same period.
police, under fire for their response, say they arrested at least 52 people in connection with the capitol mayhem. a police officer detaining a pro-trump protester as mobs stormed the u.s. capitol. credit... shannon stapleton/reuters after a day of mayhem that engulfed the capitol and resulted in the death of at least one woman, the authorities there said that they had arrested at least 52 people as of late wednesday night for a range of offenses. at a news conference, chief robert j. contee of the metropolitan police department said that roughly 47 of the arrests were for violations of the 6 p.m. curfew imposed by mayor muriel e. bowser and unlawful entry. about half of those arrests were made on capitol grounds, he said. the other five arrests were connected to weapons charges, he added. chief contee said his department, which serves the district of columbia, had been in constant communication and coordination with the u.s. capitol police, a federal agency that is responsible for safeguarding congress and congressional buildings. but it was not clear how many arrests the capitol police, which has drawn particular scrutiny, made on wednesday. no one in the department's public information office picked up the phone late wednesday night. throughout the day, as video footage of the violence surfaced, the response from law enforcement drew criticism from those who considered it to be too lenient. one video, for instance, appeared to show capitol police officers moving aside barriers and retreating as the mob flooded through.
in government, that's radical. a quick caveat here: helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration). rather, government can benefit from public-private partnerships that bring some private best practices into public sector work. brooks said: trust is our share price. we don't have market pressure, but we do have to deliver on our promise to care for veterans. we're trying to measure how we're doing with our customers just as the private sector has been doing, so we can quickly make improvements where people are getting stuck.

it has taken us 10 years to get congestion pricing back into the public discourse, and in those years, technology has transformed what is happening on our streets. hailing and microtransit apps have introduced a convenient way to get around town and increased the number of vehicles in the city. the rise of on-demand delivery has made shopping and meals a click to order and given rise to an epidemic of double-parking. had we instituted congestion pricing back then, the shape and use of these services would be wholly different today.

these sites, one in brooklyn and the other in the bronx, will operate seven days a week, day and night. everyone agrees on one thing, we want the maximum number of high priority people vaccinated, mr. de blasio said. sometimes the federal government and the state government need to stand back and let the local government do what it knows how to do best. the governor and the mayor's quarrel on vaccines was on full display on thursday as each official blamed the other this week and aides to both leaders squabbling on twitter over how to most efficiently distribute the vaccine. the mayor's plea has come as some federal officials have urged states not to stick rigidly to centers for disease control and prevention guidelines about whom to vaccinate first. there is no reason that states need to complete, say, vaccinating all health care providers before opening up vaccinations to older americans or other especially vulnerable populations, mr. azar said at a news conference on wednesday. he added that, it would be much better to move quickly and end up vaccinating some lower-priority people than to let vaccines sit around. juliana kim, luis ferré-sadurní and

patrick m. shanahan, the acting defense secretary, has taken advantage of this channel, according to another pentagon official. he has not hesitated to call mr. bolton directly, something that mr. mattis apparently did not do as much. he tended to relay questions through his recently departed chief of staff, kevin sweeney.

several states have taken action against one ministry they say has deceived people about what they are buying. the nature of what we're hearing from consumers around the state is absolutely heart breaking, said kate harris, chief deputy insurance commissioner in colorado, one state that is trying to prevent the ministry from operating there.
mr. bolton's preference, one official said, is to have one-on-one conversations with cabinet members or other senior officials directly, rather than in a group or on a conference call. he maintains more control of the process that way, this person said.
it's the truth, lowercase 't,' that i'm here to talk about today, mr. pompeo said. it is a truth that isn't often spoken in this part of the world, but because i'm a military man by training, i'll be very blunt and direct today: america is a force for good in the middle east. we need to acknowledge that truth, because if we don't, we make bad choices — now and in the future.

health & hospitals, a sprawling system of 11 hospitals, five nursing facilities and more than 70 community-based health care centers and extension clinics, faces many challenges: shrinking state and federal funds, a decline in patient population, a large uninsured and underinsured patient population and a funding gap that is expected to balloon to $1.8 billion by the 2020 fiscal year.
ms. oakley said the decision could increase costs for medicare patients, who are generally responsible for 20 percent of the medicare-approved amount for outpatient drugs covered by the program. most people on medicare have supplementary insurance, like a medigap policy or retiree health benefits, to help pay their share of the bill.
second, the house should quickly draw up and pass articles of impeachment. and then the senate should hold a fair — but immediate and efficient — trial both to remove president trump from office and, as important, to disqualify him from serving in public office in the future. precedent suggests that the senate would likely need to hold two separate votes on removal and disqualification, although the disqualification vote may require only a simple majority to be approved, as opposed to the two-thirds vote necessary for removal from office.
jim mattis, trump's former defense secretary, calls out president for fomenting 'mob rule.' supporters of president trump outside the capitol on wednesday. credit... alex edelman/agence france-presse — getty images former defense secretary jim mattis accused president trump of instigating the assault on the capitol on wednesday and said he should be ostracized. today's violent assault on our capitol, an effort to subjugate american democracy by mob rule, was fomented by mr. trump, mr. mattis said in a statement. his use of the presidency to destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens has been enabled by pseudo political leaders whose names will live in infamy as profiles in cowardice. mr. mattis, who resigned in december 2018 after mr. trump's abrupt decision to order the withdrawal of about 2,000 american troops from eastern syria without consulting allies, said that the country's resilience would see it through the tumult. our constitution and our republic will overcome this stain, and 'we the people' will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect union while mr. trump will deservedly be left a man without a country, mr. mattis said. he had issued a withering critique of the president's leadership in june during growing protests across the country. donald trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the american people — does not even pretend to try, mr. mattis wrote in a statement at the time.

but even as it moved to establish the refuge, the eisenhower administration recognized the need to balance resource development and conservation in the arctic. approximately 20 million acres of federal lands on the north slope to the west — which included what would become the prudhoe bay oil fields — were given to the new state of alaska in exchange for leaving the refuge undeveloped. this transfer paved the way for decades of oil and gas development on state lands across thousands of miles of the arctic.
senate sergeant-at-arms resigns following house's top security official stepping down. michael c. stenger had been the senate sergeant-at-arms since april 2018. credit... win mcnamee/getty images three top security officials on capitol hill are stepping down a day after a mob of pro-trump supporters stormed the capitol, congressional leaders said on thursday. speaker nancy pelosi of california announced during her weekly news conference that paul d. irving, the house sergeant-at arms, intended to resign from his position, and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, said thursday evening he had accepted the resignation of michael c. stenger, the senate sergeant-at-arms. news of mr. stenger's resignation came after senator chuck schumer of new york, the minority leader, said he would fire mr. stenger as soon as democrats took the majority. steven sund, the capitol police chief, will also leave his position on jan. 16 after ms. pelosi called for his resignation, saying mr. sund, he hasn't even called us since this happened. mr. sund, in his letter of resignation, said he would use his remaining paid sick leave — 440 hours, about 55 days — after departing. the swift departure of the top three security officials just two weeks before a presidential inauguration reflected bipartisan outrage over the law enforcement failure to prevent a mob of violent protesters from storming the capitol as lawmakers debated the formal certification of president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s victory.
the suit also says that the authority makes unilateral decisions on virtually every important policy matter, and does not consult tenant leaders or residents. federal regulations require that residents shall be involved and participate in the overall policy development and direction of public housing operations. authority meetings with its tenants are usually held to announce policy decisions, according to the lawsuit.

murkowski is the first republican senator to say trump should resign: 'i want him out.' senator lisa murkowski called for president trump's resignation, and suggested she may leave the republican party if it continued to align itself with him. credit... anna moneymaker for the new york times senator lisa murkowski, republican of alaska, called on friday for president trump to resign, denouncing him in unsparing terms and even suggesting that she might leave the republican party if it continued to align itself with mr. trump. i want him to resign, ms. murkowski said in an interview with the anchorage daily news. i want him out. he has caused enough damage. she went on: he's either been golfing or he's been inside the oval office fuming and throwing every single person who has been loyal and faithful to him under the bus, starting with the vice president. he doesn't want to stay there. he only wants to stay there for the title. he only wants to stay there for his ego. he needs to get out. he needs to do the good thing, but i don't think he's capable of doing a good thing. in the long term, ms. murkowski's suggestion that she might leave the republican party — if the republican party has become nothing more than the party of trump, i sincerely question whether this is the party for me, she told the anchorage paper — could prove even more significant than her support for mr. trump's removal.
pennsylvania g.o.p. refuses to seat democratic lawmaker in state legislature. lt. gov. john fetterman of pennsylvania in 2019. this was a corruption of the fundamental democratic franchise in our state, he said on tuesday, after he was escorted out of the legislature. credit... marc levy/associated press the effort by congressional republicans to deny the presidential results found an echo in the pennsylvania legislature on tuesday, when republicans voted not to seat a democratic lawmaker who was elected in november and to remove the lieutenant governor, also a democrat, as the presiding officer of the state senate. on a typically ceremonial day of swearing in members, pennsylvania's senate majority refused to seat senator jim brewster, whose narrow victory was officially certified but is being challenged in court. in a contentious, chaotic session, republicans also voted to remove lt. gov. john fetterman as the senate president and to replace him with the top republican in the chamber. the lieutenant governor refused at first to leave the rostrum, and for several minutes both he and the republican voted into his place tried to recognize motions from the floor. eventually, mr. fetterman stepped away. i was escorted out, mr. fetterman said in an interview minutes later. this was a corruption of the fundamental democratic franchise in our state. he said mr. brewster's win in november was certified by the secretary of the commonwealth and compared the state republicans' actions to president trump's efforts to subvert the outcome of his race.
last quarter may well have been the start of bad times for bonds. peter chiappinelli, a member of the asset allocation team at gmo, points out that bonds moving in the same downward direction as stocks has happened before and will happen again. that bonds are a dampener is not preordained by god, mr. chiappinelli said. as we saw in the '70s and '80s, there are times when stocks and bonds can have a positive correlation, he said, meaning those assets can move in the same direction.

so since i visited susie and there was this little lull in the fires, it's picked back up again, and whatever small amount of rain fell, authorities are saying, really made no difference to the fires that are continuing to rage all along the coast. and we've got weeks, if not months, left of them.
society came to be seen as an atomized collection of individual economic units pursuing self-interest. selfishness was normalized. as steven pearlstein puts it in his outstanding book, can american capitalism survive? old-fashioned norms around loyalty, cooperation, honesty, equality, fairness and compassion no longer seem to apply in the economic sphere.
the country, one of the richest and best organized in europe, has been facing a reckoning during the pandemic; years of economization and systematic overregulation there have caused myriad organizations to work against one another.

i have been married to a man for almost 40 years. he's a good man, but he's not my soul mate. i have wanted to leave him several times. i never did, for the usual reasons: kids, economics, laziness, fear of the unknown. we went on, the kids grew up, and we just settled in. about six years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia. in october 2018, he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. i thought i knew everything about this man but he has surprised me and, moreover, given me a lesson in love. he used to be full of anxieties and anger. now he has distilled himself down to pure love. it's who he is and how his days go. he tells us how much he loves us, he tells people he's supposed to know but has forgotten how much he loves them. it's not just words, it's action; in his eyes, his face, his gestures. he lights up at your presence; he kisses your hand; he tells you how wonderful you look. he dispenses love from a bottomless well. there is no filter, no bargaining for affection. and i stand here, in awe. — mary carroll, copake, n.y.
the costumes — from a pink easter bunny to an ironic butterfly — carried obscure references to stories written about the fictional private detective by the british author sir arthur conan doyle. the winner was an english teacher from germany dressed as the grimpen mire, a fictional british bog mentioned in the doyle classic the hound of the baskervilles. a crew from the reality show cake boss brought in a cake shaped like a bust of holmes.

while mr. warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first democrat to be elected to the senate from georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved ossoff-perdue race and its implications for the next two years in american politics. whichever party wins that race will control the senate, with republicans counting on mr. perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain mr. biden's policy ambitions.
that age limit came into effect after the guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old british teenager who sought help at the british embassy in islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. she had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her british passport before being allowed to return to the united kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.

top officials in new york clash over where police personnel stand in the vaccine line. video transcript back bars 0:00 / 2:00 - 0:00 transcript new york city clashes with state on vaccinating police officers mayor bill de blasio said the state halted new york city's plans to vaccinate large numbers of police department employees, and called on the state to give local governments more flexibility vaccinating residents. yesterday, i told you about new state rules that had come out that we interpreted, we think very clearly, very appropriately, very legally, to mean that we could vaccinate our correction officers, that we could vaccinate our police officers who respond to 911 calls, who have to administer cpr, who have to administer narcan to stop someone from overdosing. the folks who at any moment could be in very close, intimate proximity with another person. and obviously another person who could have covid. we were ready to go and do a huge vaccination effort at department of correction and the n.y.p.d. we were told by the state that they would not allow that. they are allowing a smaller percentage, several thousand n.y.p.d. medical corps members, and we're going ahead with those vaccinations. but we really think the rules couldn't be clearer.

president trump entered the new year facing flare-ups of long-burning crises with two old adversaries — iran and north korea — that are directly challenging his claim to have reasserted american power around the world.
but he had some concerns that in their haste to help family members some family offices might not follow the proper protocols. you want to protect the validity of the studies and you want to make sure you protect the subjects participating in these clinical trials, he said. i'm imagining what happens if i have my billion dollars and i fund a clinical trial for some disease my son has. and then we screen my son and he's not eligible for it. i say, 'hey, i want my son in.'
after we read these types of stories, we might take a step back and nod thoughtfully about how bad it all seems. maybe we install an ad blocker. many people shrug it off as an inevitability of modern life. the tools that monitor ad trackers are growing increasingly available and (sometimes) user-friendly. it's worth installing them.
it turns out, it's not where we go to church (or don't) that determines our opinion on climate. it's not even our religious affiliation. hispanic catholics are significantly more likely than other catholics to say the earth is getting warmer, according to a 2015 survey, and they have the same pope. it's because of the alliance between conservative theology and conservative politics that has been deliberately engineered and fostered over decades of increasingly divisive politics on issues of race, abortion and now climate change, to the point where the best predictor of whether we agree with the science is simply where we fall on the political spectrum.
in november, the administration removed the person responsible for the next edition of the report and replaced him with someone who has downplayed climate science, though at this point it seems to be too little, too late. but the efforts started back in 2018, when officials pushed out a top official and leaned on scientists to soften their conclusions — the scientists refused — and then later tried to bury the report, which didn't work either.
the proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. the new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the affordable care act. they would, for example, not have to provide certain essential health benefits like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.

he rose to vice chairman before retiring in 1989 at 55. he arrived at the new york fed after another serendipitous encounter: sitting next to e. gerald corrigan, the institution's president at the time, on a plane in 1992. mr. corrigan soon asked him to join the new york fed as head of markets. a year later, he was named president.
the divide illustrates why democrats are working to focus public attention on the painful costs of the partial government shutdown — vulnerable families going without food assistance, farmers forgoing crop payments, national parks trashed — and mr. trump's recklessness in courting it, rather than delving into the specific details of erecting a barrier on the southwestern border.
the compassionate lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. the novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the small of things, hands, wounded children — all designed to elicit sympathy. stock characters crowd the narrative. one of them, grace's world-weary colleague mitchell hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (there can be a gap between policy and practice) to border services (the agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country's official boundaries).
dr. robert a. chapman, a medical oncologist at henry ford health system, described the administration's action as an example of reverse robin hood. under the policy, he said, the government took money from hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people and redistributed most of it to hospitals that did not qualify for the program.
but when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get jeffersonians and jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of george mcgovern and george wallace when the vietnam war went bad. and when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual jacksonian in the white house.
the logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters, ms. cancian said. the best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel.
i have been contemplating quitting my job for the past six months or so. i'm finally certain about the decision, but i can't seem to find the right time to tell my boss. it didn't seem right just after the holiday break. then i came down with the flu and missed several days, putting additional stress on my team. plus the company is in the middle of kicking off several big new projects, and my role would be integral. our company is small, and i have a close relationship with everyone, my boss included. i don't think anyone suspects that i am even thinking about leaving. i have had a couple of amazing years here and expected to stay longer. but i'm burned out by long hours for not enough money and don't find creative satisfaction in the work any more. it's starting to affect my personal and professional relationships. i don't want to blindside my boss, but i fear postponing this conversation, as that may just overcomplicate things. i would love some advice. anonymous
the times of london reported on four british women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. the women's families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.
when things do go awry, mr. taylor said, southwest will not take kids out of the airport and will instead keep watch over them through the wee hours. if my 12-year-old had been in that situation even outside its unaccompanied minor service, she would have been free to hang out with the kids whose parents had paid the fee, but could also have left the airport on her own. my wife and i probably would have told her to stay rather than trying to find a hotel room late at night.

mr. hughes is one of the co-founders of facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. he and mark zuckerberg were roommates at harvard, and early on, mr. hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. the social network's colossal success fast-tracked mr. hughes's career. in 2008, he joined barack obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage my.barackobama.com, a robust system that organized obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. in 2012, when facebook went public and the new republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. his tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. later that year, he joined with mr. warren and ms. foster to form the economic security project.
it did not have to be like this. had the united states not become diverted from rebuilding the country by its invasion of iraq in 2003 (which i mistakenly supported), or had different military and development policies been tried, these forces of division might have been overcome. according to the pakistani journalist ahmed rashid, there was simply too much emphasis on the electoral process in kabul and not nearly enough on bread-and-butter nation building — in particular, bringing basic infrastructure and agriculture up to the standards that afghans enjoyed from the 1950s until the soviet invasion of 1979.

the actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). the paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. the result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.

washington — for years, immigration advocates have defined hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children by the sympathetic term dreamers. long irritated by the rhetorical branding, president trump finally came up with his own rejoinder: americans are dreamers, too.
but unlike mr. obama or especially president george w. bush, who gave long, comprehensive speeches explaining their approaches to the wars of the middle east, mr. trump rarely takes the time to lay out his thinking in any depth. instead, he offers americans edgy tweets or clipped sound bites in short encounters with reporters, leaving it to others to outline his strategy, although he plans a statement of his own on wednesday morning.

a flood of commentary followed, with many noting that the mob appeared to be largely white and insisting that they would have been treated far more harshly had they been black or protesting racism. ivanka trump called the rioters american patriots while urging them to stop the violence, in a tweet she later deleted. her brother, donald trump jr., said, this is wrong and not who we are, adding, don't start acting like the other side. in a video posted hours after the attack on the capitol began, president trump repeated the false claim that the election had been stolen, adding but you have to go home now. he added, we love you.

simon & schuster drops senator hawley's book. image senator josh hawley on wednesday. his book, the tyranny of big tech, was scheduled for release in june. credit... drew angerer/getty images simon & schuster said on thursday that it would cancel the publication of an upcoming book by senator josh hawley, a missouri republican and trump ally who challenged the results of the presidential election and was accused of helping incite the mob that stormed the capitol on wednesday. his book, the tyranny of big tech, was scheduled to be published in june. we did not come to this decision lightly, simon & schuster said in a statement. as a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints. at the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support senator hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat. the senator's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. the subject of mr. hawley's book, which was already available for preorder on amazon and other retailers, is not about the election or mr. trump, but about technology corporations like google, facebook and amazon. its cancellation was remarkably swift and raised questions about how publishers will approach future books by conservatives who have supported mr. trump's efforts to invalidate the election. rebukes on twitter aimed at simon & schuster for their plans to publish the book came from several writers and at least one simon & schuster author.

even though mr. ryan says he believes that freedom is the ability to buy what you want to fit what you need, he doesn't want the government to do anything to help people experience that freedom. if he got his way on spending, the programs that allow the poor and struggling to buy food, housing and the other things they need would be utterly debilitated. the rich are the only ones who could be truly free in his vision of the country.
that's bad news. the extra time slows many students' progress toward an advanced degree or a good job. when students stay for an additional year, it costs them or their parents as much as $40,000, and at public institutions, taxpayers foot part of the tab. and with undergraduates lingering, there is also less room for other students to enroll. most important, the longer it takes students to graduate, the more likely they are to drop out.
a vaccine made by a chinese company is said to be effective, and could help fill a gap left by western countries. a worker in september at a factory producing sinovac's coronavirus vaccine in beijing. credit... wang zhao/agence france-presse — getty images brazilian officials said thursday that a coronavirus vaccine made by a chinese company was effective, bolstering the chances of approval for a second chinese inoculation that could be rolled out in much of the developing world. officials in the state of são paulo, where a prominent medical research institute carried out a large study of the vaccine made by the beijing-based sinovac, said the inoculation had an efficacy rate of 78 percent. the vaccine prevented all participants from developing serious and mild complications from the virus, officials said, calling it a highly effective preventive tool. in anticipation of approval, the vaccine, called coronavac, has already been shipped around the world as countries prepare for mass inoculation campaigns. sinovac has sold more than 300 million doses, mostly to low- and middle-income countries, accounting for about half of the total doses that china says vaccine makers were capable of producing in 2020, based on an analysis of company statements and media reports. china has set its sights on supplying the developing world with a covid-19 vaccine, in a push to position itself as a leader in health diplomacy after its failures in the early days of the outbreak.
as someone who grew up in a small town in middle america, i have a (hopefully) straightforward question: why is this shooting not be discussed as a potential act of domestic terrorism (or more provocatively nativist extremist terrorism)? when immigration is the major political issue of the day, and the statements made by this individual clearly reflect an attempt to inspire fear that would affect a group of people, and when the connection between that group of people and a current hot-button political issue is pretty obvious, why is this not an act of terrorism? imagine all the circumstances of this were reversed: if the same act had been committed by a person from another country, who was a member of a racial/religious group that was in the minority in america, and this person had targeted white americans and shouted death to your country instead of go back to your country this would be on the front page as an act of likely terrorism. so why is this being treated so differently? obviously, i care because the victim could easily have been me or my children. vikaas sohal, san francisco
he gave his own first sermon at the age of 11 and, after graduating from morehouse college, went on to union theological seminary in new york, where he also worked as a youth minister at the abyssinian baptist church, where another preacher-turned-politician, adam clayton powell jr., once led. for more than 15 years, he has spoken from ebenezer baptist church, once the home of the rev. dr. martin luther king jr., preaching about politics from the church pulpit. he has said some of his sermons are designed to make people uncomfortable, urging black churches to be more accepting of gay people and criticizing them for being shamefully slow to focus on gender inequality. in his book, the divided mind of the black church, he criticized white churches for being participants in slavery, segregation and other manifestations of white supremacy. mr. warnock, speaking before dawn on wednesday, told voters that he was honored by the faith they had shown in him. may my story be an inspiration to some young person who is trying to grasp and grab hold of the american dream. matt stevens and

if entry into skull and bones opened mr. bush to accusations of snobbery, it also meant association with a community of gifted people with whom mr. bush would form lifelong friendships -- and mr. bush's strategy at yale was clearly to build great friendships, more than a great transcript. it was also a perfectly reasonable strategy, for one could argue that yale graduates in the 1960's got further on the networks they made than on the grades they earned.

they do not quarantine upon arrival in indiana; an official previously argued in a court filing that quarantining would be costly, and would extend their absences from their home institutions. but they interact with dozens of the complex's employees who assist with executions. a bureau of prisons official disclosed that, after one execution, eight team members had tested positive for the virus. the two men scheduled for execution next week both tested positive for the virus last month, along with many others held on death row at the terre haute complex. the bureau of prisons has reported 112 active cases of coronavirus among inmates there, and 1,051 prior infections, with four deaths. the other prisoner scheduled for execution next week, lisa m. montgomery, is not housed at the all-male facility in terre haute with the vast majority of death row inmates, but at the federal medical center carswell in fort worth, texas. two of her lawyers contracted the coronavirus after visiting her there, and a federal judge temporarily blocked her execution from proceeding. in her ruling on friday, judge magnus-stinson specified that, for executions to proceed, staff participants at them must wear masks and be required to be tested daily for two weeks if they come into close contact with another person at the complex, before interacting with any inmates. she also required the bureau of prisons to maintain contact logs and said contact tracing must happen after any positive test results.

london — for months, prime minister boris johnson has been whipsawed by the forces of the pandemic, caught between an opposition that accused him of acting too late and lawmakers in his own party who complained that he had gone too far in locking down britain's economy to curb the coronavirus.

internet sleuths are trying to identify capitol hill rioters. a mob acting in president trump's name stormed the capitol on wednesday. credit... jason andrew for the new york times an amateur army of internet sleuths has been identifying the people involved in the riot on capitol hill on wednesday. they began by homing in on the name tags and corporate logos on the rioters' t-shirts and backpacks. within hours, they were analyzing facial features and bread crumbs left on social media. they identified the friends, family members and colleagues of dozens of people who had appeared in live videos. and they began to hand over the results of their digging to the authorities. accounts have encouraged followers to send tips to the f.b.i. and users have indicated in the comments of some tiktok videos that they have done so. tiktok user maria b identified at least 10 members of the mob to her more than 138,000 followers. these two guys stormed the capitol yesterday, she said in one post. i don't know their names yet, but i've been digging around and i will expose them when i find out. another twitter and tiktok user even revealed the identity of her mother, aunt and uncle, all of whom had attended the event. an instagram account called @homegrownterrorists that cropped up on wednesday quickly gained more than 241,000 followers and shared the identities of at least 22 people. on friday morning, the account and its backup page had both been deactivated.

but in recent years, it has become something murkier in definition and more reflective of our highly competitive, 24-7 work lives. the shifting definition and expanding mobility of the office — thanks to remote work and the rise of contractors in the gig economy — is also making the sick day somewhat passé, at least for some jobs.
previous american administrations had resisted striking general suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the united states and iran.

so let's carry on with this hypothetical. say we opened the floodgate of development. what kind of effects could we expect? the economy would grow, and by a lot. according to a recent paper by the economists chang-tai hsieh, from the university of chicago's booth school of business, and enrico moretti, from the university of california, berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the united states' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.

these happy words require a few layers of explanation for nonspecialists. they also open up one of the biggest issues around city ballet today. le baiser de la fée (the fairy's kiss) is a four-scene ballet composed by igor stravinsky in 1928. and mr. b is the choreographer george balanchine, who first staged baiser in 1937. in 1972, he choreographed the score's dance suite, divertimento from 'le baiser de la fée,' for new york city ballet; and in 1974 he added the finale from the complete baiser. this version had no scenery, no fairy and no kiss; it has remained in repertory ever since.
iran's announcement — that its nuclear program will have no limitations in production, including enrichment capacity — was among the biggest consequences so far in the chaotic aftermath of the killing in baghdad of the commander, maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the country's de facto no. 2 official.

setting his sights on the inauguration, biden says impeachment is up to congress. president-elect joseph r. biden jr. declared that it was a good thing that president trump had decided not to attend the inauguration. credit... kriston jae bethel for the new york times with washington in turmoil and lawmakers threatening president trump with impeachment, president-elect joseph r. biden jr. put his focus on friday on inauguration day and the chance to press ahead with his agenda, sidestepping the question of whether mr. trump should once again be impeached. mr. biden declared that it was a good thing that mr. trump had decided not to attend the inauguration on jan. 20 and said the president had exceeded even my worst notions about him. but mr. biden deferred to congress on whether mr. trump should be impeached over his role in inciting the violent mob that stormed the capitol on wednesday. what the congress decides to do is for them to decide, mr. biden said. i think it's important we get on with the business of getting him out of office, he added. the quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th. what action happens before or after that is a judgment for the congress to make, but that's what i am looking forward to, him leaving office. with the pandemic's death toll continuing to grow, mr. biden spoke with urgency about the health and economic crises facing the country, and his plans to take action upon assuming office.
over the past decade, the explosion in the number of international students has turned education, almost by stealth, into one of the most vital american exports. the idea that a student taking classes in iowa city or ann arbor can be counted as an export might seem strange. in economic terms, however, the student's situation is not so different from, say, a japanese company buying american soybeans: foreign money flows into the united states from abroad — except that in this case, the product doesn't leave the country.
of course, this does not describe your situation. i think you are well within your rights to decline to contribute, but there is a decent chance you will pay what amounts to a social cost for doing so: your manager and other colleagues may, even unconsciously, suspect that on some level you're not really a team player. i don't think that's fair, but it can occur anyway.

mr. trump praised the rioters in multiple tweets, including one saying, these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. twitter said in its blog post, after close review of recent tweets from the @realdonaldtrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence. it concluded that mr. trump's tweets since wednesday's attack were likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on jan. 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so. after close review of recent tweets from the @realdonaldtrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https://t.co/cbpe1i6j8y — twitter safety (@twittersafety) january 8, 2021 the move was a forceful repudiation by twitter of mr. trump, who had used the platform to build his base and spread his messages, which were often filled with falsehoods and threats. mr. trump regularly tweeted dozens of times a day, sending flurries of messages in the early morning or late evening. in his posts, he gave his live reactions to television news programs, boosted supporters and attacked his perceived enemies.

to be a good skier requires balance, rhythm and an animal-like ability to respond to constant variations in topography and snow conditions. every meter of trail varies in slope, pitch and smoothness. skis will slide differently over snow that has been shaded or lies on a north-facing slope versus snow in an open, sunny field. and snow changes day by day, hour by hour. skiers must maintain balance over their skis as they glide over what may be a rough or rutted surface or when they hit a patch of snow that is softer and slower. losing balance costs speed, and long practice is needed to attain this skill. but once it is mastered, the skier can speed across the landscape, almost floating above the snow. and on downhills, good skiers preserve their momentum and use it to glide up the next hill. and therein lie the joys of what i will argue is a most elegant and engaging sport. harry read, madison, wis.

why do this with only about two weeks left in president trump's term? because we must defend our democracy for all americans, now. and we must preserve our democracy for future americans. we must ensure a field of potential republican presidential hopefuls in 2024 who have integrity. and we must reassure the world, and especially would-be authoritarian regimes, about what united states policy will be on questions of freedom and self-rule now and in the future.
in her experience, dr. hayhoe has found that the best way to neutralize the partisan charge on climate change is not by appealing to science — which some prominent republicans, such as senator ted cruz, have cast as a competitor to religion — but by emphasizing shared values. for some, this could be the well-being of our community, she writes. for others, our children; and for fellow christians, it's often our faith.

when minnesota made vaping more expensive, they found, smokers kept smoking instead of switching to e-cigarettes. a longstanding decline in adult smoking in the state slowed way down, while smoking in states that hadn't imposed big vaping taxes continued to fall. the researchers concluded that making e-cigarettes more expensive discouraged minnesota smokers from trying them and caused fewer of them to switch away from smoking. by measuring the difference in the trends, the researchers estimated that minnesota caused around 32,000 more adults to keep smoking cigarettes.

the agreement with guatemala, which was signed in july, was described by kevin k. mcaleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security at the time, as a way to encourage families to apply for protections closer to home. the deal made migrants such as hondurans and salvadorans ineligible for asylum in the united states if they had traveled by land through guatemala and did not first apply for asylum there, homeland security officials said at the time.
building up on this successful experience, mr. suleimani spent the last decade replicating the hezbollah model in iraq, syria and yemen, propping up local militias with precision weapons and tactical know-how. in syria, his forces have allied with russia to prop up the regime of bashar al-assad, a project that, in practice, has meant driving over 10 million people from their homes and killing well over half a million. in iraq, as we have seen in recent days, mr. suleimani's militias ride roughshod over the legitimate state institutions. they rose to power, of course, after participating in an insurgency, of which he was the architect, against american and coalition forces. hundreds of american soldiers lost their lives to the weapons that the qods force provided to its iraqi proxies.

the election of the rev. raphael warnock and jon ossoff was a political triumph for the democratic party in a state that has stymied it for decades. it was also a jarring split-screen encapsulation of the politics of progress and grievance that have defined mr. trump's administration and the changing country he is sworn to serve.

a hundred years ago, theodor herzl identified the jewish question of the twentieth century as the literal survival of jews in the face of external enemies committed to our physical annihilation--jew-haters in every nation where jews lived as a minority. his solution--the creation of a secular jewish state--was to change the nature of jewish life in dramatic and unanticipated ways. a hundred years later, the jewish question of the twenty-first century is survival in the face of our internal challenges. herzl also anticipated that this new jewish question might arise if and when our christian hosts were to leave us in peace. this is now coming to pass. the solution to this jewish question also requires the creation of yet another jewish state: a new jewish state of mind!
this demographic is the key to understanding israel's political system because it is the group that all parties need to win over if they want to control the government. a successful political party today has to offer a jewishly flavored israeli patriotism. other parties battling to represent the political center in israel — such as yesh atid and kulanu — succeed in attracting this pool of jewish-israelis.

earlier, the mayor said at a news conference that new york city had 270,000 vaccine doses available for new yorkers who are 75 and older. throughout the week, mr. de blasio, mr. cuomo and members of their administrations have been sparring publicly over the sluggish pace of vaccinations in the city. as of early friday, only 167,949 of 489,325 doses had been administered — about 34 percent, which was lower than the rate across new york state, which was about 50 percent. on thursday, a spokesman for mr. cuomo suggested the city needed to move more quickly to vaccinate them before expanding inoculations to other groups. at his news conference, mr. cuomo said he still believed state and local officials needed to prioritize health care workers. he blamed the slow pace of vaccination on hospitals, saying they had been slow to accelerate the rate at which they were inoculating their workers. in an effort to boost the vaccination rate, the state will allow the vaccine to be distributed outside hospitals, including at private doctor's offices, local health departments, ambulatory centers and pharmacies, all of which will require appointments to distribute vaccines. statewide, 500 pharmacies will be allowed to begin providing vaccines next week, mr. cuomo said. the state health department will also set up a distribution site next wednesday at the jacob k. javits convention center in manhattan, which served as a field hospital last spring.

jan. 7, 2021, 5:48 p.m. et jan. 7, 2021, 5:48 p.m. et when does incitement become sedition? experts say it's complicated. this is not dissent, president-elect joseph r. biden jr. said wednesday. it's disorder. it's chaos. it borders on sedition. credit... doug mills/the new york times president-elect joseph r. biden jr. said wednesday's mob attack on the capitol borders on sedition. the national association of manufacturers took out the qualifier: this is sedition, it said in a statement that accused president trump of having incited violence in an attempt to retain power. and within the first hour of the attack, merriam-webster reported, sedition was at the top of its searches, ahead of coup d'état, insurrection and putsch. to many scholars and historians, the use of the word sedition — defined as incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority — was not misplaced. treason, traitor, terrorism, sedition — these are strong words with specific meanings that are often tossed aside in favor of their buzzword impact, joanne freeman, a historian at yale university, said in an email. but meanings matter. and sometimes, those words apply. but did it apply on wednesday? geoffrey r. stone, a legal scholar at the university of chicago, said that might have been the case. normally, it refers to speech that advocates action or beliefs that are designed to overthrow or undermine the lawful processes of government, he said of the strict definition of sedition. actions like burning down a building, or assassinating someone — those are separate crimes.

when trump won, cambridge analytica tried to take credit so they were back on our radar but just for making [expletive] claims about their own importance. i was glad when the trump campaign manager brad parscale called them out for it. later on, we found out from journalists that they had never deleted the database and had instead made elaborate promises about its power for advertising. our comms team decided it would be best to get ahead of the journalists and pull them from the platform. this was a huge mistake. it was not only bad form (justifiably angering the journalists) but we were also fighting the wrong battle. we wanted to be clear this had not been a data breach (which, to be fair to us, it absolutely was not) but the real concern was the existence of the dataset no matter how it happened. we also sent the journalists legal letters advising them not to use the term breech which was received normally by the nyt (who agreed) and aggressively by the guardian (who forged ahead with the wrong terminology, furious about the letter) in spite of it being a relatively common practice i am told.

in 2016, the authority was supposed to award 10 percent of the $150 million in capital fund construction contracts to businesses who hired people who lived in nycha buildings, were low-income or received housing assistance. only 0.4 percent, or $60,857, of contracts awarded fit that specification. three percent of $66 million in nonconstruction contracts was supposed to be awarded to people and businesses in those categories, a total of $1.98 million, but less than 1 percent, $634,670, was awarded, according to authority records.
the u.s. broke its daily record for new cases for the second straight day. an ambulance crew rushed a coronavirus disease patient into the emergency department at providence mission hospital in mission viejo, calif., on friday. credit... lucy nicholson/reuters the united states broke its single-day record for new coronavirus cases for the second consecutive day on friday with more than 300,000 cases, as public health officials warned the winter surge would only worsen. it was the first time the country had crossed the 300,000-case mark, according to a new york times database. hospitalizations are also at a near-record high — 131,889, according to the covid tracking project — and officials across the nation reported more than 3,890 new deaths on friday, the third-highest daily tally of the pandemic. we believe things will get worse as we get into january, dr. anthony s. fauci, the united states' top infectious disease specialist, said in a radio interview early thursday. it didn't take long for him to be proved right: things immediately got worse. by thursday night, the united states had set a record for daily reported deaths, with at least 4,111, as well as a record 280,292 new infections. those figures were an uncomfortable reminder that while many americans were fixated on the political events roiling washington after a mob stormed the capitol on wednesday, the pandemic hadn't ceased wreaking havoc.
mr. museveni, 76, is campaigning for his sixth term in office, after signing a law in 2018 scrapping the age limit for presidential candidates, which had been 75. he is largely expected to win the upcoming vote. political analysts say that he faces a fragmented opposition, and he won plaudits for championing infrastructure projects — from new factories to hospitals and roads. he has also capitalized on the notion that his government has handled the pandemic competently; uganda has reported only 290 coronavirus-related deaths.
the s&p 500 fell from its highest point of the day, after sliding from that peak in the moments after the capitol was placed on lockdown, but it ended with a gain of 0.6 percent. the dow jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent to a record. trading in other corners of the financial markets showed investors were focused on the economic growth that could follow as democrats push for more federal spending.
washington — president trump and democratic congressional leaders dug in wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a white house meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over mr. trump's demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.
mr. biden said that if there was an imminent threat that warranted this extraordinary action, americans should receive an explanation and the facts to back it up.
the first story takes place in 1812, when napoleon was battling the czar for control of the pale of settlement (the western part of czarist russia), where millions of jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. a victory for napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. a victory for the czar would keep the jews impoverished and miserable. the great hasidic rabbi shneur zalman--the founder of the lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of rosh hashanah to offer a prayer to god asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the jews. everyone expected him to pray for napoleon. but he prayed for the czar to defeat napoleon. in explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: should bonaparte win, the wealth of the jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. at the same time their hearts will be estranged from our heavenly father. should however our czar alexander win, the jewish hearts will draw nearer to our heavenly father, though the poverty of israel may become greater and his position lower.

the details of this report, combined with everything else swirling around in economic policy and the financial markets, make for a more optimistic case. there is an opportunity for 2021 to be the year of a remarkable bounce-back, thanks to monetary and fiscal stimulus; the delayed effects of buoyant markets over the last few months; and above all the prospect of widespread coronavirus vaccination.
the last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed the end of state-sponsored and church-supported anti-semitism. the fall of the soviet union, a nation that, since the time of stalin, had been a major source of international anti-semitism, had a domino effect on ending the state sponsorship of this oldest of bigotries. other nations within the soviet sphere of influence stopped espousing anti-semitism as a matter of government policy. even most arab and islamic countries dropped their overtly anti-semitic policies. as a result, the united nations has changed its tone, condemning anti-semitism and reducing somewhat its pro-arab and anti-israel bias. equally important, the catholic church--the single institution most responsible for the persecution of jews over the past two millennia--approved diplomatic relations with israel, thus annulling its entrenched view that jewish homelessness ... was the divine judgment against jews for rejecting jesus. the american lutheran church explicitly rejected martin luther's anti-semitic teachings.

in late 2010 and early 2011, the u.s. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. you might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.
mr. evans posted video to his facebook page of him filming as he stood among the crowd outside a capitol door and then rushing inside with them. another man, richard barnett, 60, from gravette, ark., was taken into custody and faces three counts. he had posted a picture on social media that showed him sitting at a desk in ms. pelosi's office with his feet up and said he had expected to be arrested. i'll probably be telling them this is what happened all the way to the d.c. jail, mr. barnett told a new york times reporter later that day. a day earlier, federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint accusing a man named mark j. leffingwell of punching a capitol police officer repeatedly in the head and chest, before apologizing. prosecutors also unsealed charges against a maryland resident, christopher alberts, accusing him of illegally carrying a 9-millimeter pistol at the riot. mr. alberts told the police that he had the weapon for personal protection and did not intend to harm anyone.

more than 4 million votes were cast in the georgia runoffs, surpassing the 2016 election. voters enter the tabernacle of praise church international in mcdonough, ga. credit... audra melton for the new york times with control of the u.s. senate at stake, more than four million georgians cast ballots in tuesday's runoff contests, surpassing the number of votes cast in the state during the 2016 presidential race, state election officials said. more than three million of those votes were cast early or by absentee ballot, with more than 1.2 million people turning out at the polls on tuesday, gabriel sterling, a top election official in georgia, said during a news conference late on tuesday night. mr. sterling said that the election day voter turnout was more than we anticipated and that the counting was expected to continue into wednesday. brad raffensperger, georgia's secretary of state, told cnn late on tuesday night that about 200,000 votes were still waiting be counted. as was the case in the november election, election officials said, the votes waiting to be counted came from dekalb and fulton counties in metro atlanta, as well as other areas that favored democrats. the surge in turnout capped a two-month heated runoff in a swing state that had long favored republicans but where the changing electorate, particularly in the suburbs, helped democrats make momentous strides.
barr says trump's incitement of the mob betrayed his office. former attorney general william barr in september. credit... oliver contreras for the new york times former attorney general william p. barr said thursday that president trump betrayed his office by encouraging a mob of supporters to intimidate congress into overturning the election results by storming the capitol, joining former defense secretary jim mattis in blaming mr. trump for the violence. mr. barr, who stepped down from office last month under pressure from mr. trump, said in a statement to the associated press that the president's conduct betrayed his office and supporters and that orchestrating a mob to pressure congress is inexcusable. mr. barr was widely seen as the cabinet member who did the most to advance the president's political agenda, and the statement was unusually strong given mr. barr's praise for the president in his departure letter even as mr. trump pressured the justice department to help his effort to overturn the election results. immediately after a violent mob of mr. trump's supporters stormed the capitol on wednesday, mr. mattis was among the first former cabinet officials to directly blame mr. trump, calling the attack an effort to subjugate american democracy by mob rule that was fomented by mr. trump. former defense secretary mark t. esper and retired gen. joseph dunford, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under mr. trump, also criticized the politicians who had supported mr. trump's claims and spread false information about the election.

he said that mr. trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst. they will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in american history, he said of mr. trump's supporters. that will be their legacy. former president george w. bush, the only living republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the capitol. he did not mention mr. trump by name. it is a sickening and heartbreaking sight, mr. bush said. this is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic. i am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement. read more

the first is the simplest: in financial markets, being brilliant isn't enough. the best traders have to not only understand the fundamentals of the asset they are trading, but also have almost a sixth sense for how the timing and momentum within markets will evolve. you can lose a lot of money having the right idea at the wrong time.
however, a potential employer does not need your permission to try to talk to others it believes might know your work. absolutely, they can call someone else, said donna m. ballman, an employment attorney in fort lauderdale, fla., and the author of stand up for yourself without getting fired. plenty of companies make a point of calling someone else, specifically to get a different perspective.
this president should not hold office one day longer, said mr. schumer, who will become the majority leader with the seating of two new democratic senators elected in georgia this week. the quickest and most effective way — it can be done today — to remove this president from office would be for the vice president to immediately invoke the 25th amendment. if the vice president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, congress should reconvene to impeach the president.
these systems were established across in the united states in the 19th century. the premise was that steering people who commit minor offenses to probation, rather than prison, and shortening prison sentences with parole in exchange for good conduct further the goal of rehabilitation. but that notion fell out of favor after the country embraced mass incarceration in the late 20th century, driving up the prison population from about 200,000 at the start of the 1970s to a peak of 1.6 million at the end of the 2000s.

senator chuck schumer of new york, the democratic leader, has portrayed mr. blair and mr. duffey as two of the four key witnesses he believes the senate should call in mr. trump's impeachment trial, along with mr. mulvaney and john r. bolton, mr. trump's former national security adviser. senator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, has expressed opposition to calling witnesses and again criticized the house investigation on friday.
the most significant finding in our study is that 55 percent of israeli jews belong to a group whose like-minded identity we call jewish-israeli. this runs counter to the conventional wisdom, which holds that israel is divided between left and right, and secular and religious groups. these jews' identity is, in many ways, a new brand of judaism born from mixing a strong affinity for jewish traditions and a national sentiment in a way that makes the two almost indistinguishable. for example, they are jews who keep a kosher home and send their children to serve in the military; they put up an israeli flag on independence day and celebrate their son's bar mitzvah. this is not about religiosity; it is about culture — a culture whose pillars are ancient judaism and modern israelism. this group also shares some core beliefs about politics, including a realization that peace in the middle east won't happen any time soon.
but those who saw the aftermath said the destruction was also random. an exhibition honoring joseph rainey, the first black person to serve in the house of representatives, was left untouched, said a longtime staff member who was inside the capitol at the time of the attack. but nearby a memorial set up to honor former representative john lewis, the civil rights pioneer, was destroyed. a photograph of mr. lewis had been displayed on an easel. it was completely destroyed, torn into pieces, the staffer said. mike baker and
strikingly, the sharp uptick in emissions occurred even as a near-record number of coal plants around the united states retired last year, illustrating how difficult it could be for the country to make further progress on climate change in the years to come, particularly as the trump administration pushes to roll back federal regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions.
too often we hear stories of a watch being stolen from having been left out in the open. even worse is when the watch is not insured. adding watches to a homeowner's policy is simple and in most cases not too costly; most insurers require just a certified appraisal from the dealer who sold the watch to you.

pet policies typically don't cover pre-existing conditions, mr. blyskal said, so premiums are generally lower when your pet is young and healthy. even if you start early, though, you may end up paying more over time, he said, because some policies raise premiums as pets get older. this can increase costs substantially, he said, and cause owners to drop their policies as the animals get older — just when they are more likely to need the coverage. industrywide, the average pet policy is maintained for three years or less, according to an insurer regulatory filing in 2016 in washington state.

bill clinton's presidency marked the end of discrimination against jews in the upper echelons of government. for the first time in american history, the fact that an aspirant for high appointive office was a jew became irrelevant in his or her selection. president clinton--our first president who grew up in an age when anti-semitism was unacceptable--selected several jewish cabinet members, two jewish supreme court justices, numerous jewish ambassadors and other high-level executive and judicial officials. nor, apparently, was jewishness a bar to election to the united states congress, which has ten jewish senators and more than two dozen jewish representatives, several from states with tiny jewish populations. though we have still not had a jew at the top of either party's ticket, it is fair to say that in today's america, a jew can aspire to any office, any job, and any social status.

it's a funny question. america is a young country, but the cold war is a late episode even in our short history. from ben franklin to langston hughes, americans have articulated our distinctiveness in ways that did not implicitly culminate in a twilight struggle with communism. but the central argument of bacevich's book is that, for america's major institutions, its ruling class and the intelligentsia that serves them both, angstrom's question was deeply threatening. too much was riding, psychologically and financially, on the economic policies, military posture and cultural orientation that had outmatched the soviet union. as a consequence, when that pole star suddenly winked out, we didn't consider changing course. we opened the throttle and surged forward in the dark, guided by the illusory stars in our eyes.
