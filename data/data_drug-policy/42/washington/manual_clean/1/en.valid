mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.

in clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. it is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. the only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.

normally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. this requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.

some residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls. a survey from the american college of emergency physicians found that 20 percent of emergency medicine practices laid off doctors this year. it's a strange paradox in the midst of a pandemic when it seems like emergency medicine doctors should be in high demand.

in oregon's case, the acting u.s. attorney, billy j. williams — who is awaiting senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.

my attitude did not change after i began working in a mine closer to home just outside clintwood, va. the company i worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. but the problem was still apparent. we would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
but after sessions announced the new policy, the white house declared that trump was completely in agreement.
may 6 added castro's position on covering undocumented immigrants.
the venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. the ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the american economy, berkshire's warren buffett said in a statement at the time. our group does not come to this problem with answers. but we also do not accept it as inevitable.

coal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the united states. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.

the republican talking points are the things we heard in the general elections, [that the democrats are] radical socialists who want a government-run health-care system, said ken thorpe, professor of health policy at emory university. on almost every ad it's either directly talked about or implied.
this is the approach advocated by biden, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and moderate democrats. yet the republicans spent the last two months pummeling ossoff and warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as medicare-for-all proponents.

we're putting our own lives at risk, our family's lives at risk, emergency medicine physician r.j. sontag, the president of the emergency medicine residents' association, told the post. we're in, frankly, a financially precarious position with a ton of debt and limited income. and the fact of the matter is that employers just aren't hiring.

april 3 added o'rourke positions based on survey returned from his campaign.
a high-profile venture that promised to disrupt health care is disbanding.
a study published in the journal clinical infectious diseases in january found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in u.s. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. the study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.

aug. 15 hickenlooper dropped out of presidential race.
south africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. britain's health minister matt hancock told bbc radio 4's today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the uk new variant. the south africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. john bell, a professor of medicine at the university of oxford and a member of britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.

but in massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, u.s. attorney andrew lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws congress has already passed, and that i will not do.
with 50 seats and a tie-breaking vote from harris, senate democrats would have to get every single one of their members in line — or nab the help of some republicans to pass legislation. and unless there's a budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass, they'd need 60 votes to get around any filibusters.

july 31 added quotes from the first night of the second democratic debate about health care for undocumented immigrants.
with recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. not only has wall street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.
a growing body of research shows that overuse and misuse of antibiotics in children's hospitals — which health experts and patients say should know better — helps fuel these dangerous bacteria that attack adults and, increasingly, children. doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, kaiser health news's laura ungar reports.

in colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim u.s. attorney bob troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.
many of those i worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. they had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. in many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.
nick mullins is a founder of breaking clean, an environmental communications firm. he blogs at thethoughtfulcoalminer.com.
he told fox news host bill o'reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. but as he was campaigning in colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, trump said in an interview with denver's kusa: i think it's up to the states, yeah. i'm a states person. i think it should be up to the states, absolutely.
there really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, fauci, who directs the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said monday. fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.
