We now have, in what I believe is a states' rights area, 93 unelected federal officials determining state decisions, Gardner said.

Among Republicans, the topic is a particularly treacherous one, because it pulls at the seams of the party's coalition — pitting social conservatives against those who stand most strongly for states' rights, libertarians and fiscal hawks who see the burgeoning marijuana industry as a major source of tax revenue.
Meanwhile, Gardner said he is marshaling fellow lawmakers to oppose the new policy. A dozen senators met Tuesday in Gardner's office to talk about what we need to be doing legislatively and the direction we should be pursuing in Congress on this matter, he said.
South Africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. Britain's health minister Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the UK new variant. The South Africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of Britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.
Oregon has long had a tolerant attitude toward marijuana. It decriminalized possession of less than 1 ounce in 1973. And the newly legalized recreational pot industry brought in $85 million in tax revenue last year, said state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.
A Florida state representative is calling for Mar-a-Lago to be shut down after President Trump's private club held a New Year's Eve bash in which attendees did not wear masks in violation of a Palm Beach County mask order, The Post's Lori Rozsa reports . Palm Beach County officials said they were reviewing the complaint from state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat from nearby Lake Worth Beach.
Although marijuana is illegal under federal law, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing recreational consumption. Pot is legal, in some form or under some circumstances, in an additional 22 states.
Will it really hurt us among young voters? It could, Reed acknowledged, but he added: You cannot ignore a federal law on the books. It breeds cynicism. It undermines respect. It undermines confidence in government itself.
Many of those I worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. They had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. Those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. In many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.
Normally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. This requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.
And now House Democrats have tweaked rules around paying for legislation, potentially making it easier for their members to pass bills if they can be reasonably seen as related to the coronavirus pandemic or climate change.
Children's hospitals may be partially to blame to for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
This is the approach advocated by Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Democrats. Yet the Republicans spent the last two months pummeling Ossoff and Warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as Medicare-for-all proponents.
Both Ossoff and Warnock have said they want to expand health insurance incrementally through broadening the Affordable Care Act and creating a government-backed public option plan for Americans, rather than overhauling the whole system with Medicare-for-all or something like it.
In Clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. It is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. The only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. Again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.
It's been a year since the first rumblings of a coronavirus outbreak in China. On Jan. 4, 2020, the World Health Organization tweeted that it was investigating a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The following day the U.S. agency said that China reported its first cases to the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019, and that at least 44 cases had been reported, The Post's Siobhán O'Grady reports
OOF: England is entering a new national lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak driven by a new, more contagious virus variant.
The attorney general is going to find out pretty quickly he's in a distinct minority, not only among the American public, but in the United States Congress, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management and author of the 2016 book Marijuana: A Short History.
Some insist that GOP candidates will not suffer from the new policy if they make clear that they disagree.
During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump sent mixed signals on the issue.
With most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday. In England, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.
Researchers say that the overprescription of antibiotics is fueling drug resistant strains of dangerous bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
AHH: U.S. health officials are rejecting suggestions to defer the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
I was not a user, so they would ask me if I'd turn them in. My typical response: Do what you want to do, but if I catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, I'll make sure you never work here again.
Sessions's directive, issued last week, overturns an Obama-era policy discouraging federal enforcement in states where marijuana is legal. The attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.
Most states have adopted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. But states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.
In Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim U.S. attorney Bob Troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.
How important marijuana becomes as a topic of campaign debate is likely to hinge on how Sessions's directive, issued last week, is implemented by U.S. attorneys across the country, many of whom are serving on an interim basis until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed by the Senate.
A Wisconsin pharmacist tried to spoil 500 doses of a coronavirus vaccine because he believed they were unsafe, according to Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol, The Post's Hannah Knowles reports . The employee of Aurora Health Care removed Moderna vaccine vials from refrigeration, seeking to sabotage the supplies, but charges are still up in the air as investigators seek to determine whether the removal of the doses hurt their viability. At least 57 people received doses that were taken out of refrigeration.
The President believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. That would be his top priority. That is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law.
But the initiative is ending with little to show for its efforts, as health-care costs continued to grow in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. A spokesperson for Haven said that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase would continue to leverage insights gained from the joint-venture. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).
In recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimens that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.
Because vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. This happened, for instance, at a Giant Foods store in Northeast Washington, D.C., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, The Post's Lola Fadulu reports . The decision was in line with guidance from the D.C. Department of Health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.
Haven, created two years ago by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website Monday that it will shutter, The Post's Jay Greene reports.
The United Kingdom has already announced it will prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose of an authorized vaccine, even if it means delaying the booster shot. Limited data suggests the first vaccine dose may offer partial protection, and some prominent public health officials argue it's worth taking the risk to stem the spread of the virus.
OUCH: Young ER doctors who risked their lives in the pandemic are struggling to find jobs.
The venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy, Berkshire's Warren Buffett said in a statement at the time. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.
We're putting our own lives at risk, our family's lives at risk, emergency medicine physician R.J. Sontag, the president of the Emergency Medicine Residents' Association, told The Post. We're in, frankly, a financially precarious position with a ton of debt and limited income. And the fact of the matter is that employers just aren't hiring.
This is a rules package that encourages us to tackle the most pressing issues facing our nation today, McGovern said in a floor speech Monday. It makes reforms to our budget rules so we can deal with these dual challenges through an all-hands-on-deck approach while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
But House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) advanced two major exceptions, which the House approved yesterday. Legislation to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic or public health consequences of the coronavirus pandemic or climate change will be exempted from the pay-as-you-go rules.
A study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in U.S. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. The study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.
The Republican talking points are the things we heard in the general elections, [that the Democrats are] radical socialists who want a government-run health-care system, said Ken Thorpe, professor of health policy at Emory University. On almost every ad it's either directly talked about or implied.
Before going to work as an underground coal miner, I worked for a subcontractor installing large mine-ventilation fans throughout the Appalachian coal fields. My co-workers were a rough sort. Some had worked as underground miners, while others had known only industrial construction or demolition. Several of them abused pain medications.
Mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. Few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. Even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.
The shutdown is the country's third after lockdowns initiated in March and November, The Post's Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Ben Guarino report. Johnson said the new variant of the virus, which has so far spread to at least 30 countries, is thought to be 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible.
With 50 seats and a tie-breaking vote from Harris, Senate Democrats would have to get every single one of their members in line — or nab the help of some Republicans to pass legislation. And unless there's a budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass, they'd need 60 votes to get around any filibusters.
Young doctors, called residents, who specialize in emergency medicine are struggling to find full-time employment even while working on the front lines of the covid-19 response. The doctors, many of whom are saddled with debt from medical school, find themselves in a predicament that would have been unimaginable for them a year earlier, The Post's Ben Guarino reports.
We have a growing, robust industry. You can't put that genie back in the bottle, Rosenblum said. We're not freaking out. One of the keys is a good relationship with your U.S. attorney.
Over the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. A survey conducted in October by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of U.S. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. Among Republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among GOP-leaning voters younger than 40.
Cannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. Politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.
Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are seeking to unseat Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, and give their party 50 seats in the Senate, making Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris the tie-breaking vote. Polls in Georgia close at 7 p.m., concluding a race that has seen record-breaking spending for a nonpresidential election.
A high-profile venture that promised to disrupt health care is disbanding.
So far, the United States has only administered a small fraction of the vaccine doses that have been distributed to states, according to a Washington Post tracker, which looks at vaccine priorities and administration state by state.
The move will likely spur House Democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand Medicare and Medicaid during the pandemic.
My attitude did not change after I began working in a mine closer to home just outside Clintwood, Va. The company I worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. But the problem was still apparent. We would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
Vaccine administration rates vary across states. While Georgia has vaccinated 0.7 percent of its population, South Dakota has vaccinated 3 percent of its population.
With recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into Appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. Not only has Wall Street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.
If a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. It is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.
But after Sessions announced the new policy, the White House declared that Trump was completely in agreement.
Gardner declined to identify the senators, but he said they include Democrats and Republicans who represent states that have legalized marijuana for medical and recreational purposes and states that are considering doing so.
Coal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.
This could make it easier for the lower chamber to pass bills related to the coronavirus pandemic and send them over to the Senate, putting pressure on that body to approve them.
Some may judge me for not turning people in. But before I rushed to judgment, I considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.
But in Massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: Deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws Congress has already passed, and that I will not do.

Early indications are that they could head in significantly different directions, reflecting different priorities.
(Monica Akhtar,Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)
New York confirmed its first case of the new U.K. strain on Monday. The case was identified in a 60-year-old man who had no recent travel history and comes after cases have also been identified in California, Florida and Colorado.
Any significant health-care legislation will likely originate in the Democrat-run House.
A growing body of research shows that overuse and misuse of antibiotics in children's hospitals — which health experts and patients say should know better — helps fuel these dangerous bacteria that attack adults and, increasingly, children. Doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, Kaiser Health News's Laura Ungar reports.
In Oregon's case, the acting U.S. attorney, Billy J. Williams — who is awaiting Senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.
The Georgia elections, if they go the way of Democrats, would expand the ranks of senators backing a public option.
Over the past three decades, I have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. If we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal.
The dearth of jobs is the result of a domino effect: Many people stayed away from hospital emergency rooms this past year, wary of contracting the virus. As patient numbers dropped, emergency departments brought in less money. As a result, cash-strapped employers stopped recruiting new doctors, Ben writes.
Some residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls. A survey from the American College of Emergency Physicians found that 20 percent of emergency medicine practices laid off doctors this year. It's a strange paradox in the midst of a pandemic when it seems like emergency medicine doctors should be in high demand.
This is one more headache, Hudak said, and one more issue that they do not want to be on the defensive about with the voters.
Yet even incremental health coverage expansion won't necessarily be possible in the Senate, even if Ossoff and Warnock win.
Georgia's two Republican Senate candidates careened over the weekend toward a rocky end to their high-stakes dual runoff races, trying hard to avoid becoming collateral damage in a series of raging disputes that have embroiled the GOP, our colleague Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports.
Republican candidates for Congress will answer that question based on what fits their district or state, said Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an evangelical political group that has campaigned against legalization.
But top government health officials dismiss the suggestion. Leading infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui have all recently roundly rejected proposals to alter the timeline of the two-dose vaccine regimen.
He told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. But as he was campaigning in Colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, Trump said in an interview with Denver's KUSA: I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.
There really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. Fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.
Many of the places where marijuana legalization is most popular — in California, for instance, where it has just taken effect — are also areas where Republicans are struggling the hardest to hold onto House seats.
