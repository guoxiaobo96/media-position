House Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.
Ultimately, Trump was the logical consequence of a posture followed for decades at the top echelons of the conservative movement: The batty screeds are silly, but since they help us, we won't work zealously to purge them. Trump's conspiracy-based capture of the GOP has less to do with him and his perspective than with a party that sought and often won the support of people who believe those notions.
On Sept. 18, during a congressional hearing, Marino complained to Leonhart, the DEA administrator, about Rannazzisi's comments on the conference call.

In October 2015, one of the last remaining obstacles to the bill was removed. Rannazzisi was pushed aside at diversion control. With the inspector general's investigation into his comments hanging over his head, Rannazzisi retired from the DEA after a 30-year career.
The diagnosis was surprising: Type 1 diabetes. Alec's blood sugar levels were nearly twice the healthy limit. His family didn't have a history of diabetes, and lanky, 6-foot-3 Alec looked like the picture of health. At 23, he seemed too old for Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes because it often strikes children. But as Alec discovered, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune response that can appear at any age. It is not preventable, and there is no known cure.
He wrote on disclosure forms in July 2015 that he may do cannabis consulting and that he had received income that year for unspecified consulting work.
To public health experts, the delays — and lack of transparency about what, exactly, is wrong with the test — are extremely concerning.
In January, Mike Gill, who had served as the chief of staff to DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, left the agency to join one of the nation's largest health-care law firms. He declined to discuss why the DEA dropped its opposition to the bill or his new job.
— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.
Five of the Taliban's negotiators are former U.S. prisoners of war who each spent a dozen years in captivity in Guantanamo.

The first visit to a primary state by a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate found a candidate still honing her stump speech, with a well-oiled campaign infrastructure and audiences that were still in the tire-kicking phase. It revealed plenty about how Warren, who has been urged to run for president since at least 2013, would approach a real campaign. The caricature of Warren — by mid-December, she was being covered as a flawed and stumbling liberal who had missed her best shot to run for president — did not survive intact. Here's what replaced it.
In inflation-adjusted terms, federal supply-side anti-drug spending ballooned from $2.2 billion in 1981 to $15.3 billion in 2012. You can disregard that crater in 2002 — a temporary change to the drug spending calculation was made that year, resulting in a number of significant spending lines removed from it.

Michael Botticelli, who led the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy at the time, said neither Justice nor the DEA objected to the bill, removing a major obstacle to the president's approval.
An LA Times editor noted this of Republicans' response to Ocasio-Cortez's tax proposal:

WHAT THEY SAID IN PUBLIC Feb. 15, 2007 The United States and our allies will help President [Hamid] Karzai increase the size and capabilities of the Afghan security forces.

Public health experts differ on how quickly that might happen — and when things might start to feel normal again around the country.
The administration's response to the coronavirus is being led by a task force helmed by HHS Secretary Alex Azar and national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien. Some senior White House officials are wary of relying too heavily on producers abroad to ensure that the United States has enough medical and pharmaceutical supplies to respond to the outbreak should it expand here.
Manchin has sided with Trump on tough votes before, such as the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. But voting to acquit the president would be an even more politically charged decision, one that could help him maintain his reputation as a moderate back home but would probably make him a pariah within his own party.

Rather than focusing on bad doctors and pharmacists, Rannazzisi and Barber decided to target the companies feeding the pill mills: the wholesale drug distributors, some of them massive multinational corporations.
The collective snub was the first move in a looming upheaval in how the state's urban sheriffs do their job. In the fall, all seven of the most populous counties elected African Americans as their top law enforcement officer — not only a reflection of the shifting dynamics here, but a sharp break from the nation's historical pattern of picking white men for the position and then keeping them there in perpetuity.
Now according to supply-side drug-control theory, increasing this spending should result in a concomitant increase in drug prices. But look what happened to heroin prices, in inflation-adjusted terms, over the same time period — they dropped like a rock.
One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring! Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
The DEA is now hammering all of us, Ann Berkey, then a senior vice president of McKesson Corp., wrote in a 2014 email to another senior McKesson officer, according to a deposition in the Cleveland case.
That same day, Leonhart, who had supported Rannazzisi's aggressive approach, announced that she was retiring as DEA administrator amid reports that some of her agents had attended sex parties funded by Colombian cocaine cartels.
There really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. We don't have any idea what the level of protection is and what the durability of protection is. It's fraught with some danger when you're making a decision about the regimen you're going to use when you don't really have a considerable amount of data.

Since taking over in 2017, Trump has continued to assert that a wall is needed but has backed away from insisting that Mexico pay for it. He has instead said the money should come from U.S. taxpayers, an idea that has divided Republicans. But many Republicans, some reluctantly, have agreed to follow his lead during the current shutdown.

Currently, she said, a dozen state and local health departments can do the testing, although positive results need to be confirmed by the CDC. She also said she hoped that tests from commercial labs would soon come online.
I found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the Mayflower Hotel that bookended the gala. The judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting Supreme Court justices in their 80s — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. Numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. I counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by Trump — and at least 11 of the names on Trump's expanded list of potential Supreme Court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.

Those filings also showed that the DEA was examining Mallinckrodt's plant in Hobart, N.Y., about 70 miles southwest of Albany.

Every member is making up their own mind, Schumer said in a statement to The Washington Post. They know how I feel.
— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.
I'm not going to have the kind of relationship with him that Democrats have, Manchin said in an interview last month.

In unusually candid interviews, officials who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama said both leaders failed in their most important task as commanders in chief — to devise a clear strategy with concise, attainable objectives.
Another warlord who was a prime beneficiary of U.S. largesse was Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek strongman from northern Afghanistan who now serves as one of the country's vice presidents.
More than most potential candidates for the president, Warren seemed to be ready for the brickbats. The senator from Massachusetts is the first high-profile Democratic contender, with preexisting grass-roots support, a national fundraising network and credible poll numbers in early-voting states. Four years ago, Warren rejected a campaign to draft her into the presidential primary; since then, she has grown more influential in the party, introducing bills that would give workers more control of corporations, shrink the influence of lobbyists and turn the federal government into a generic-drug manufacturer.
This division is much the same as the argument over lockdowns, where Kantians argued for doing everything to save every last soul (through complete lockdowns), while utilitarians argued that a more balanced approach would work better in the long run. That issue is still very much alive. Added to this classic dilemma, there is the scientific problem.

So why the continued focus on supply-side policies? Part of it is that after 40 years, a staunch, no-compromises anti-drug culture is firmly entrenched in places like Comey's FBI and Rosenberg's DEA. Also, substance abuse treatment doesn't fall within the portfolio of law enforcement agencies.
But many public health experts think that in light of evidence that the disease has taken root and spread in Iran, Italy, Singapore and South Korea, it's time to broaden testing in the United States. Infectious disease experts fear that aside from the 14 cases picked up by public health surveillance, there may be other undetected cases mixed in with those of colds and flu. What scares experts the most is that the virus is beginning to spread in countries outside China, but no one knows whether that's the case in the United States, because they aren't checking.
The study, by Alexander Hertel-Fernandez of Columbia University and Matto Mildenberger and Leah C.

Those same problems now afflict the distribution of the vaccine, the miracle of scientific achievement that has the potential to bring the pandemic to an end.

At the current pace it will take a really long time. … I think if we can get our act together and start vaccinating 1 million people a day like President-elect Biden is promising, then we can get to 260 million people getting at least one dose … more or less or by late August or early September.

To be clear — this law does not 'decrease' DEA's enforcement against distributors, said John Parker, a spokesman for the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, which represents drug distributors. It supports real-time communication between all parties in order to counter the constantly evolving methods of drug diversion.
In August 2006, the DEA issued a show-cause order asking McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, why its operations at the company's distribution center in Lakeland, Fla., should not be shut down. The DEA alleged that three McKesson distribution centers filled hundreds of suspicious orders of hydrocodone, such as Vicodin, placed by Internet pharmacies.
Complicating matters for the White House, McConnell has distanced himself from the discussions since Trump turned on the spending bill passed by the Senate last month, which enraged some Republicans who had voted for the measure believing that they had Trump's backing.

The blueprint overall is just that: a starting framework. One promising idea calls for increased pricing transparency, a popular idea among insulin-access activists that has also been gaining ground in state legislatures. The blueprint also recommends bringing more generic drugs onto the market. Right now, the United States has two relatively new follow-on insulins, which are similar to generics, but they are only marginally cheaper. Some experts say more competition is needed to lower prices. In December, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement on policies that will put more generics on the U.S. market, including for insulin starting in 2020, as part of a transition that was written into the Affordable Care Act. We've heard frequent reports of patients rationing insulin, and in some cases dying because they can't afford the injections they need to survive, the statement read. These tragic stories aren't isolated occurrences. And they're not acceptable for a drug that's nearly a century old.

But is it heartfelt? In the eyes of some — with the increasing rate of gun violence and little to no legislation to minimize it — the phrase has come to be synonymous with inaction. Rather than filling theoretical boxes with empty gestures, says artist Jon Krause, those thoughts would better serve our country if applied toward tangible, collaborative solutions.
Trump has said that drug companies are getting away with murder, and he has singled them out on Twitter, but some experts say his administration's blueprint takes a harder line on PBMs than it does on pharmaceutical companies. And though Trump pledged in late May that drug manufacturers would lower their prices — and a few voluntarily did so — none lowered the price of insulin. In July, Novo Nordisk raised its list prices on two insulins another 5 percent.

Sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters in graduation pictures, he recalled. Some were wearing football jerseys. They had their whole lives ahead of them, and then they were gone.
Nicole wanted pharmaceutical companies to start by being more transparent about their prices — to disclose how much it costs to manufacture a vial of insulin and what the profit margin on each vial is. Ultimately, she wanted them to reduce the price. They're going to tell you it's complicated or they can't share that information with you, she said to a reporter. It's not all that complicated. They're choosing to make it complicated. It's just plain greed.
Enter Birkhead, a 58-year-old former semipro football player who had headed the police forces of Duke University and the nearby town of Hillsborough. He cast himself as a representative of the county's inclusive values — a protector of everyone who's here, regardless of their immigration status — and he pledged not to cooperate with ICE unless legally compelled. Winning the trust of Durham's Latinos, he said, meant distancing himself from a federal agency known for tearing families apart.
The debate is playing out as the United States struggles with administering the doses it already has. More than 15 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data updated Monday morning, but only about 4.5 million have been administered.

During a 2006 visit to the eastern city of Jalalabad, Boucher asked Sherzai whether he needed help with any construction projects.
Nov. 4, 2018, issue: Control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance. The makeup of the Senate is at stake. Therefore, Tuesday's election results will be an illuminating moment for the direction of the nation. But, for New Mexico artist Eric Petersen, it's just the latest round of stupefyingly zero-sum gamesmanship between our two major political parties. This illustration was inspired by a very popular video game played by my 11-year-old son in which two opposing teams compete to cover the shared territory with their own color, Petersen said. The U.S. as a functioning entity is being erased by our partisan turf war. Is this what we want?
His office released 87 inmates to ICE last year. That cooperation left many immigrants fearful, particularly in light of the Trump administration's stepped-up enforcement.
The Post has twice investigated the industry's battles with the DEA, first in 2016 and again in 2017 with 60 Minutes. But the full story has never been told because so few of the people involved will talk about it. The list of people who have declined to be interviewed includes former congressman Tom Marino (R-Pa.), who first proposed the bill; former acting DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg, whose agency surrendered to the pressure; former attorney general Loretta E. Lynch, whose department did not stand in the way of the legislation; and, finally, then-President Barack Obama, who signed it into law.
By March 2007, the number of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan had climbed to 50,000. Despite the increase, McNeill said nobody in charge was able to articulate a clear mission and strategy.
Many individual Federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the Federalist Society. Rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. In that sense, the Federalist Society is a talent network and placement agency as well.
Dec. 2, 2018, issue: Sunlight diminishes. Temperatures plummet. We're forced to stay inside. The dawning of this annual ritual is only redeemed for many of us by the figurative warmth of holiday season social gatherings. Unless, of course, there is no one with whom you can share them. In my own work I'm often thinking about loneliness and melancholy, so this assignment didn't feel unnatural, says Chloe Scheffe of her illustration. A fluorescent season of merriment, the ubiquitous presence of social media: They can only paper over the loneliness that's out there. It's incredibly easy, notes Scheffe, to feel isolated in the real world.
Morhaim says he has steered clear of legislation affecting the medical marijuana industry during the current legislative session. Busch has removed him from the House committee that considers bills affecting the health-care industry.

We worked collaboratively with DEA and DOJ . . . and they contributed significantly to the language of the bill, Whitlock wrote in an email. DEA had plenty of opportunities to stop the bill and they did not do so.
Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of holding the government hostage:
In the interview documents obtained by The Post, U.S. and NATO officials partially blamed themselves for the predicament. They said they moved too slowly to build up the Afghan forces during the first few years of the war when the Taliban presented a minimal threat. Then, after the Taliban rebounded, they rushed and tried to train too many Afghans too quickly.
-- Scientists say the high-pitched noise that diplomats in Havana complained about before displaying mysterious neurological symptoms may have been caused by one of the region's insects. The Guardian's Ian Sample reports: [A] fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the UK and the US now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the Indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as Anurogryllus celerinictus. … The identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats' health problems.
Jan. 10, 2021, issue: The time has come: In just a few days, President Donald Trump will have to pack up and leave, whether he likes it or not. Then President-elect Joe Biden's team will have to do a deep clean of the White House — starting with the Oval Office.
March 22, 2020, issue: I started participating in March Madness bracket pools as a kid. I'd do all the necessary research (i.e., watching a lot of SportsCenter) — yet, inevitably, the winner would be someone who knew nothing about the sport. With this image, I wanted a literal interpretation of a bracket pool, complete with a smug winner surrounded by the carnage of upsets and buzzer-beaters, represented by the abandoned pool floats. Then, after the image went to press, the tournament was canceled as the coronavirus pandemic worsened. For me, this quickly put things in perspective. I feel awful for the players, especially the seniors who likely won't play college basketball again.
A Florida state representative wants Mar-a-Lago shut down for violating coronavirus safety restrictions.
On May 11, four days after Nicole's trip to Eli Lilly, President Trump and Azar stood in the White House Rose Garden to unveil American Patients First, the administration's blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs. The president told the crowd, We will have tougher negotiation, more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter. And it will start to take effect very soon.
Gottlieb said his agency developed its computational model to identify the possibility of abuse of designer street drugs for which there is little pharmacological data. The model, he said, can predict how a substance will behave in the body and affect various receptors in the brain based on its chemical structure and its similarity to drugs for which there is data.
Morhaim declined to answer questions from The Post about his business dealings in medical marijuana for months, until the news organization obtained a portion of the dispensary application by Doctor's Orders that touted his involvement.
Ultimately, the DEA and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. Government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company's lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by The Washington Post.
Newly unsealed documents in a landmark civil case in Cleveland provide clues to one of the most enduring mysteries of the opioid epidemic: How were drug companies able to weaken the federal government's most powerful enforcement weapon at the height of the crisis?
In a Lessons Learned interview in December 2016, Khalilzad acknowledged that by refusing to talk to the Taliban, the Bush administration may have blown a chance to end the war shortly after it started.

John Mulrooney,DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney IIHead of the DEA administrative court that handles pharmaceutical cases, he wrote a law review article sharply critical of the new law. the chief DEA administrative law judge, has been documenting the falling number of immediate suspension orders against doctors, pharmacies and drug companies. That number has dropped from 65 in fiscal year 2011 to six so far this fiscal year, according to the DEA. Not a single order has targeted a distributor or manufacturer since late 2015, according to Mulrooney's reports, which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams also defended the numbers, although he declined to comment directly on Trump's statement. From a health perspective, I have no reason to doubt those numbers, Adams said on CNN's State of the Union.
The felony charges were completely political, said Durham Mayor Pro Tempore Jillian Johnson. There was no justification.
At first, in public and in private, the Obama administration leaned on Karzai to fully investigate the Kabul Bank scandal — not only to recover the stolen money but also to demonstrate to the Afghan people that no one was above the law. The episode was seen as a pivotal moment, not just in the anti-corruption campaign but in the war itself, according to the Lessons Learned interviews.
In public, Pentagon officials started to revise their assessments. They still said the security forces were making progress but acknowledged that maybe they had overstated the Afghans' abilities in the past.
Part of the shift can be traced to the contentious national conversation about how law enforcement treats communities of color — from the Trump administration's policy of deporting immigrants without criminal records to high-profile police beatings and killings of African Americans. In North Carolina, those issues were at the core of several urban sheriffs' races.
I believe in private property so strongly I want everybody to have some. (APPLAUSE) Education helps the young. Empowerment lifts the able. But there are those who need much more: children without role models; young people captured by gangs, addiction or despair. Government can spend money, but it cannot put hope in someone's heart or a sense of purpose in someone's life. This is done by caring communities, by churches and charities that serve their neighbors because they love their god. Every day they prove that our worst problems are not hopeless or endless. Every day they perform miracles of renewal. What we need is a new attitude that welcomes the transforming power of faith. In the words of a writer who visited the Mount Haven (ph) section of Bronx, ``The beautiful old stone church is a gentle sanctuary from the terror of the streets outside.'' In city after city, for the suffering and hurting, the most powerful passageway is the door of the house of God. We're going to extend the role and reach of charities and churches and synagogues and mosques, mentors and community healers in our society. As president, I will rally the armies of compassion in neighborhoods all across America. I'll lift the regulations that hamper private and faith-based programs. I'll involve them in after-school programs and maternity group homes, drug treatment programs and prison ministries. And I have laid out specific incentives to encourage an outpouring of giving in America.

But Obama added a last-minute wrinkle that caught many of his senior advisers by surprise. He imposed a timeline on the mission and said the extra troops would start to come home in 18 months.
Saying he was ready to toss in the towel, Rumsfeld added: I don't think it is responsible to the American taxpayers to leave it like it is. We need a way forward. I've worked on it and worked on it. I am about to conclude that it is not possible for the U.S. Government bureaucracy to do the only sensible thing.

And that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. By then Barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (Josh Blackman, a popular Federalist social media force and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.) Barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'You want to do something about this?' I said, 'Sure.' … And he said, 'Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' 
While South Korea has run more than 35,000 coronavirus tests, the United States has tested only 426 people, not including people who returned on evacuation flights. Only about a dozen state and local laboratories can now run tests outside of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta because the CDC kits sent out nationwide earlier this month included a faulty component.
At other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of the base, the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. Take the GOP's relationship with Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson, who won four states in the 1988 Republican presidential primary contest. In 1991, Robertson published The New World Order, holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all. He even suggested that President George H.W. Bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. Still, Republicans wanted votes and donations from Robertson's acolytes, so Newt Gingrich, Oliver North, William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jesse Helms and Dinesh D'Souza all happily spoke at his Road to Victory conferences. Sen. Bob Dole, a pillar of the Republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told Robertson's followers in 1995 that I am proud to stand up here and say that I've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 from the Christian Coalition.
That community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where Federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. The Georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. The Federalist Society is one of our most active student organizations, law school Dean of Students Mitch Bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in March. Of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.
Trump also used Twitter on the first day of 2019 to insult a retired U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sing the praises of an ultranationalist former aide and tell the United States to chill and ENJOY THE RIDE.
The issue came up again after Hurricane Sandy, but the Obama administration was less flexible than the Bush White House, Diament said.

Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, had given the Pentagon permission to use Pakistani airspace and let the CIA track al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistani territory. As a result, the Bush White House was slow to recognize that Pakistan was simultaneously giving covert support to the Taliban, according to the interviews.
With so many Republicans in Congress having been elected since the GOP wave elections of 2010 and 2014, few have experience in withstanding the sort of strong headwinds generated by full control of government and an unpopular president of their own party. Many Republicans appear unconvinced that major Democratic gains are even possible this November. … they are comforting themselves with the memory of Trump's unlikely victory, in defiance of long political odds and expert prognosticators.
Morhaim (D-Baltimore County) promptly did so, sending a letter to his colleagues in which he apologized for bringing the House of Delegates and himself into a negative light in the public media.
Jeffrey Eggers, a retired Navy SEAL and White House official under Bush and Obama, said few people paused to question the very premise for keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
April 19, 2020, issue: I wanted to illustrate the dire nature of our collective situation: that we see images of the destruction wrought by climate change all the time, and yet our world leaders do nothing. Here, a polar bear clings to a melting ice cube, and even though we know it's killing him, we still drink nonetheless.
I think that sometime in the second half of the year there will be enough vaccination in the U.S. and some other countries that we will begin to treat covid-19 more like seasonal flu, which is deadly to large numbers of people but does not overwhelm health care and does not cause us to curtail normal social contact. This is because with enough vaccine in those at high risk of death and hospitalization, transmission may continue (at a reduced level thanks to some immunity in the population from prior infection and vaccine) but the outcomes will be less severe.
The United States again set a record for coronavirus-hospitalizations on Monday, with over 128,000 people receiving inpatient treatment nationwide, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. That figure represents an increase of more than 2,800 patients from the previous day, Antonia Farzan reports. The largest jump was reported in California, where more than 22,000 patients were hospitalized with covid-19 as of Monday, more than any other state. Highlighting the dire toll that the surge is taking, ambulance crews in hard-hit Los Angeles County were told Monday to ration their use of oxygen due to widespread shortages at hospitals. Ambulances have also been directed not to bring patients to the hospital if they have effectively no chance of survival. … Adjusted for population, Arizona, Nevada and Alabama saw the most patients hospitalized with covid-19 on Monday, followed by California.
The House passed the bill by unanimous consent. Not one lawmaker opposed the measure.
Hunt is seeking damages totaling at least Lesnar's disclosed $2.5 million purse, plus a share of the pay-per-view payout from the July 9 event, citing damage to Hunt's reputation, fight career and marketing abilities, as well as lost opportunities to engage in fair competition. Hunt is also seeking lawyers fees and other relief under the guise that the defendants committed fraud and other crimes prosecutable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which Congress passed in 1970 to tie mafia bosses to the corrupt actions of their lower-ranked employees. The law has since been used in a more broad context, allowing individuals to sue any enterprise if they can demonstrate that enterprise has engaged in certain criminal activity.
Mulrooney said in his reports that the judges under him were handling so few cases at the DEA that they began hearing the cases of other federal agencies.
Molina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.
That email was sent in April 2015. One month later, a Quinnipiac poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 18 points.

Oct. 14, 2018, issue: New York Times art critic Howard Devree once compared Jackson Pollock's drip paintings to baked macaroni. So, naturally, when we asked Philadelphia artist Jon Krause, 42, to create a piece about food, a chef slinging pasta made total sense. Broadly, I'd just like to suggest there are many ways to experience the culinary arts aside from a beautiful and expensive plate from a five-star restaurant, said Krause, who made the art using spaghetti and tomato sauce after wet yarn and Silly String didn't work.

Ending pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.
Crocker, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Pakistan from 2004 to 2007, told government interviewers that Pakistani leaders did not bother to hide their duplicity.
The largest fine the DEA has levied against a drug distributor was the $150 million that McKesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers.
Coronavirus testing kits have not been widely distributed to our hospitals and public health labs. Those without these kits must send samples all the way to Atlanta, rather than testing them on site, wasting precious time as the virus spreads, said Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

Working toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen.

Limited data suggests a single shot affords some protection against disease, but it is not known how complete or long the protection lasts. The first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 52 percent effective in the three-week interval before people received the booster shot. U.S. officials have said repeatedly that while it is worth evaluating whether different dosing regimens make sense, they do not think such a strategy is supported by scientific evidence.

Seth Meyers attacked the Republicans in Congress who are actively trying to destroy democracy:
The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized a rule to limit what research it can use to craft public health protections, a move opponents argue is aimed at crippling the agency's ability to more aggressively regulate the nation's air and water, Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report. The 'Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science' rule, which the administration began pursuing early in Trump's term, would require researchers to disclose the raw data involved in their public health studies before the agency could rely upon their conclusions. It will apply this new set of standards to 'dose-response studies,' which evaluate how much a person's exposure to a substance increases the risk of harm. … Many of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the EPA from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released due to privacy concerns.
This isn't to suggest that supply-side drug-control approaches should be abandoned. Some experts, like the Brookings Institution's Vanda Felbab-Brown, believe attempts to reduce the supply of illegal drugs can be effective if they're implemented smartly. But crucially, she says, supply-side approaches must accompanied by robust substance abuse treatment programs to reduce demand for drugs.

-- Meanwhile, the effects of the shutdown are mounting. From Costa, Eilperin, Paletta and Miroff: The Department of Housing and Urban Development sent letters to 1,500 landlords Friday as part of a last-minute effort to prevent the eviction of thousands of tenants. A lot of those tenants live in units covered by a HUD program that many agency officials didn't realize had expired on Jan. 1 and that they are now unable to renew. … Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials are trying to determine whether they will be able to pay tax refunds next month, despite the fact that they said last year they would be prohibited from doing so in the event of a government shutdown.
For Conti, the Boston University economist, the administration's blueprint doesn't go far enough in addressing insurers. To guarantee that real people pay lower prices at the pharmacy, the first thing she would do is eliminate insurance plans that allow large out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs — including the kind of high-deductible plan that Alec opted not to take. It's insurance principles 101, Conti says. People should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well.
The scandal was also embarrassing to the U.S. government, which had deployed legions of financial advisers and watchdogs to Kabul yet had somehow missed a giant Ponzi scheme under their noses.

On Feb. 18, 2014, Marino introduced the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, making an effort to define what constitutes imminent danger. The proposal raised the DEA's standard for suspending drug shipments by requiring that the agency establish a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm that is more likely than not to occur.

If he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on Wednesday during an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News. That's probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people: He's going to secure our border.
This message was seen as giving cover to other Republicans because Lee, whose father was President Ronald Reagan's solicitor general, helped devise President Trump's impeachment defense strategy in the Senate last year. Lee even appeared at Trump's rally in Georgia on Monday night, where he was chastised by the president for not trying to overturn the election results.

Some events, and some gaffes, do change the national conversation. But few do so while affecting the individual fortunes of politicians. Nearly every Democrat asked about Tlaib this week had the same response: They did not like the language, and they would prefer that any impeachment talk be shelved until after investigations did or didn't turn up impeachable offenses.
The Pfizer medication is diluted before use, another factor that affects its window of usefulness. Moderna's product comes in 10-dose vials, while Pfizer's vaccine is contained in five-dose bottles.

To many Afghans, the warlords were cruel despots whose misrule helped destroy the country. So it didn't help the Americans to be viewed as the warlords' allies.
In another Lessons Learned interview, Richard Boucher, who served as assistant secretary of state for South Asia during the Bush administration, took a nuanced view of the warlords.
One tragedy is that Trump, notwithstanding his irksome personality, could have been a great president had he been able to control his temper and his tongue. Like Lear, he suffers from intermittent explosive disorder, overreacting to all kinds of unimportant matters. Trump's stream-of-consciousness Twitter storms in response to any perceived slight were childish tantrums, indicating a lack of emotional maturity that put terror in the hearts of normal adults.
Three months later, Crowley wrote to a senior vice president at Cardinal and another Purdue director to say the drug industry needed to support itself and each other and to protect itself from overzealous regulators.
But in a trove of confidential government interviews obtained by The Washington Post, U.S., NATO and Afghan officials described their efforts to create an Afghan proxy force as a long-running calamity. With most speaking on the assumption that their remarks would remain private, they depicted the Afghan security forces as incompetent, unmotivated, poorly trained, corrupt and riddled with deserters and infiltrators.
Pence and Trump were expected to hear a last-minute pitch from John Eastman, a Trump lawyer, after they returned from Georgia last night. The president has directly pressed his running mate to find alternatives to certifying Biden's win, including preventing him from receiving 270 electoral votes and trying to force the election be thrown to the House, the Times reports . Pence actually has no unilateral power to affect the election's outcome. Trump and his staff have also floated the idea of delaying Biden's inauguration, even though it is set in stone by the Constitution, per the NYT

-- Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the Senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the House. From the Hill's Brett Samuels: Collins said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that she understands [Mitch McConnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the Democratic-held House, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like Agriculture, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. 'I'm frustrated in the situation that we've gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,' Collins said. 'It is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. I think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.'

The departure of so many DEA employees for the drug industry gave the distributors an unfair advantage, said Jonathan P. Novak, formerly a DEA lawyer. There was a fear, he said. It comes from seeing that some of the best and brightest former DEA attorneys are now on the other side and know all of the weak points. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)
Second, the establishment isn't operating the way it used to. One of the great paradoxes of the last Democratic primary season is that the forces that lost — supporters of Sanders — routed the forces that won. For more than a year, they fought for, and won, changes to the Democratic primary rules that eliminated the voting power of superdelegates on the first ballot at any convention. At the same time, they won commitments from the Democratic National Committee that set up earlier debates and prioritized candidates with grassroots fundraising. The rules that infuriated Sanders supporters in 2016, allowing Clinton to build a huge delegate lead before facing her opponents, have been overturned.

The subpoena brought a windfall of information. The DEA gained access to data from Mallinckrodt's rebate or chargeback program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors.

George Conway's Federalist Society pedigree is impeccable. He has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. But he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. And he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called Checks and Balances because, they said, Trump threatens the rule of law. George Conway had even told the New York Times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.

Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.

The original ambition was not so grand. A handful of conservative law students at the University of Chicago, Yale and Harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. When we started the Federalist Society, we didn't know we were starting the Federalist Society, Lee Liberman Otis, one of the Chicago co-founders, told me. We thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'Let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' 
We're going to pass that, he said. It's just a question of how.
Blackburn, now a U.S. senator, declined an interview request but provided a statement to The Post saying she has worked to fight the opioid crisis.

Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections — a plausible scenario for many European cities, Zeynep writes, based on an analysis conducted by Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. As things stand, with those numbers, we'd expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month — assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.

-- Nancy Pelosi downplayed the possibility that House Democrats would attempt to impeach Trump without bipartisan support to do so after hearing the findings from Robert Mueller's investigation. Brian Fung reports: Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. 'If and when the time comes for impeachment,' she said, 'it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.' Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.'
One reason is that Democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress. Republicans' conspiracy theories about powerful secret actors are consistent with their small-government views; it is a shorter leap for conservatives to portray Washington as a swamp where individualism, justice and decency go to die.

There was a failure to perceive the double game that he starts to play by late 2002, early 2003, Marin Strmecki | Lessons Learned interview | 10/19/2015Tap to view full document Marin Strmecki, a senior adviser to Rumsfeld, told government interviewers.
A 2014 Run, Warren, Run, sign, printed by MoveOn, was unfolded in Storm Lake. A shirt from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee's 2012 ad campaign, I'm from the Elizabeth Warren Wing of the Democratic Party, was visible at three of the stops. In Council Bluffs, a Teamster named Bob Payne briefly pulled Warren aside to ask if she'd gotten a shirt he'd sent her office, to advertise a pension reform bill the union supported.
U.S. officials constantly said they were making progress. They were not, and they knew it.
Last week, the United Kingdom made the controversial decision to prioritize giving a first dose of its authorized vaccines — even if it meant there wasn't enough to give people a booster shot within the recommended three to four weeks. U.K. authorities have said people could wait as long as 12 weeks.
A few weeks after the Taliban prisoners in his custody died of asphyxiation, Dostum took the time to send a holiday letter to the U.S. commander in chief.
There are new cases all the time. In July, Long Island resident Doreen Rudolph tweeted about her young adult daughter's struggle to afford insulin: I just bought 2 vials of insulin for my daughter cost me $524. With a discount card. All I could buy. I left the pharmacy and sat in my car and cried. Her message struck a chord: Within five days, her tweet had been liked 70,000 times, and her $8,000 GoFundMe campaign was fully funded. To buy insulin, Rudolph told me, We've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?' 
Asked their views on the idea of a single dose, the transition team for President-elect Joe Biden did not answer with specifics. However, a transition official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in the absence of a concrete policy, said the incoming administration will follow the guidance of medical and scientific experts. If experts' recommendations about the number or pace of doses were ever updated, the official said, the Biden team would update the public on such guidance.
O'Connor, the Mallinckrodt lawyer, said that the draft document reflects discredited allegations made in the heat of negotiations in 2015 and that the government and the company moved past those accusations.

A talking point to use with the news media: DEA appears to be pursuing a path of conflict, rather than collaboration with our industry.

The new Covid-19 vaccines are remarkably effective in preventing illness. What is not yet clear — as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concedes — is whether being vaccinated will stop the people who take it from infecting others, and it's why vaccinated people are still being asked to wear masks.

You going to come? asks Conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.
Of course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.
Lawmakers could also clash with Hogan on proposals to increase the minimum wage from $10.10 an hour to $15 an hour, to penalize anyone who lacks health insurance, and to lower prescription drug prices. They may also be at odds on parole reform, and the question of whether to build a new stadium for the Washington Redskins.
Rannazzisi brought an aggressive approach to the diversion control office.

We've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?'  says Doreen Rudolph of the struggle to afford insulin for her daughter.
Mitchell has stayed out of the spotlight, even as her behind-the-scenes role escalated. Her role as a Trump legal adviser has surprised some colleagues, particularly because she is a partner at a major law firm, Foley & Lardner, that immediately faced questions about whether it endorsed such work. In a statement Monday, the firm said it was 'aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell's participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.' The firm noted as a matter of policy, its attorneys do not represent 'any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election,' although it did allow attorneys to observe recounts voluntarily as private citizens, Michael Kranish and Tom Hamburger report.
Obama told the American people that the surge in U.S. troops was temporary. He later promised to bring home all U.S. troops by the end of his presidency in January 2017.
For years, Afghan commanders inflated the numbers so they could pocket salaries — paid by U.S. taxpayers — for no-show or imaginary personnel, according to U.S. government audits. As a result, Washington now asks the Afghans to produce biometric data, including fingerprints and face scans, to verify the existence of people in uniform.
Their strategies differed, but Bush and Obama both committed early blunders that they never recovered from, according to the interviews.
May 24, 2020, issue: Tying the idea of a calendar to recognizable nonrepresentational works of art, like Piet Mondrian's Composition and Tableau paintings, evokes the feeling of looking at something familiar, but not quite right.
On Oct. 21, after spending several hours at the White House in meetings about Iraq, even Rumsfeld seemed taken aback by how much Afghanistan had receded from Bush's mind, according to a previously unpublished memo that the defense secretary wrote later that day.
By 2013, it had become increasingly difficult to answer that question. Cases were languishing at headquarters. At first, Geldhof wasn't sure why.
-- Two fresh data points from Sunday show that the Islamic State, while in retreat, has not been vanquished.
The delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.
Surfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.
The final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.
-- Warren's Senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her — or any of her prospective challengers. Politico's Burgess Everett reports: Even Sen. Ed Markey isn't ready to endorse his fellow Massachusetts Democrat, at least not yet. 'When she is moving forward, we're going to be talking,' Markey said as he prepared for Warren's swearing in to another term in the Senate. 'I've just got to get today done.' Warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. With a wide open Democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of Warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen Democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.
As pumped as anyone is Olowski, watching with me from the side. But to understand what the Federalist Society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at Federalist Society chapters and forums across the land.
Sept. 20, 2020, issue: Even before the pandemic, many teachers had it rough, performing a hard job that often pays too little. Now it's even worse. Are we really going to force them to calculate the safest distance between their students? To burden them with making sure their classroom doesn't turn into the next hot spot? For their sakes, I'd prefer we tell everyone to stay home.
Our nation's drug supply chain is highly complex, so we routinely engage with elected officials and regulators to share our knowledge, experience and occasionally, recommendations, McKesson said. There is nothing inappropriate about companies communicating with policymakers in a transparent, law-abiding way to foster a more effective working relationship with the government.
Nevertheless, Trump showed no sign Thursday that he was going to budge.
Soon, there would be even harsher action.
Two months after Obama signed the bill, Rosenberg appeared on Capitol Hill. Hatch praised him.
With respect to distributor orders, prosecutors wrote in a document, ­Mallinckrodt's obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.
As urban school districts across the country struggled with classroom reopening plans, a close look at the District's experience shows how hard it has been to develop workable strategies — and how much power teachers wield, particularly when they have a strong union behind them, our colleagues Perry Stein and Laura Meckler report.
Less than a year later, his successor in the White House decided that was not enough and sent back several thousand more U.S. troops to help the Afghans. Today, about 13,000 U.S. service members remain the country.
He added that other police departments just didn't admit they disproportionately wound up policing in minority communities.
Yet warlords were hardly the only ones the United States targeted with bribes.
If Trump wants a big immigration deal now, he'll have to give a lot more to both Democrats and Republicans who want a more compassionate approach, said Ali Noorani, executive director of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum. … The backlash against the president's comments [may] make it harder for Democrats to vote for a deal he likes, forcing him to make concessions that could anger his own base to win majorities in the House and Senate.
Every time there is an event now, people are asking: why aren't you providing a pill testing facility? Why are people needlessly dying? said Gino Vumbaca, who works for one of the organizations involved in last year's test run, the International Harm Reduction Association.
In 2008, the DEA took its strongest action yet against the drug companies. That May, McKesson agreed to pay a $13 million fine — then a record for a drug diversion case — for failing to report suspicious orders from the Internet pharmacies and drugstores. That record was shattered in October when Cardinal agreed to pay $34 million.
OOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.
Britain is going into a third lockdown.

The scale of the corruption was the unintended result of swamping the war zone with far more aid and defense contracts than impoverished Afghanistan could absorb. There was so much excess, financed by American taxpayers, that opportunities for bribery and fraud became almost limitless, according to the interviews.
House Democrats will move quickly to enact a robust package that fully addresses this global emergency without allowing this administration to steal from other necessary programs, Lowey said.
On CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to speed vaccine and therapeutics development and distribution, said the second dose gives people an immune response 10 times stronger than the first dose.
It took three years and two federal lawsuits for The Post to pry loose 2,000 pages of interview records
Following negotiations between Mallinckrodt's legal team and the U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. The negotiations then focused on the relationship between Mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to Florida.
Meanwhile, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose national profile has taken off since his decisive reelection, has pledged to continue to reach across the aisle to lower student debt, attract and retain jobs, increase development in urban areas, improve education and reduce crime.

Government watchdogs and journalists have chronicled severe shortcomings with the Afghan security forces over the years. But the interview records obtained by The Post contain new insights into what went wrong and expose gaping contradictions between what U.S. officials said in public and what they believed in private as the war unfolded.
During another visit to the war zone 10 months later, Carter said: The Afghan security forces are getting there. . . . If you'd have asked me to bet on it five years ago, I don't know. I'd maybe give you even odds on it or something. But it's coming together.
Dec. 31: ISIS is mostly gone, Trump tweeted. We're slowly sending our troops back home.
I think it's an outstanding paper, said Brendan Nyhan, a University of Michigan political scientist who was not involved with the study. The article avoids simplistic accounts of money buying votes and instead provides evidence that representational biases may originate in part from information provided by contributors and/or communication from business groups.
It was unclear whether the Wednesday session would break the budget impasse — in its 11th day Tuesday — as Trump has demanded billions of dollars for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and Democrats have rejected his request. Trump had campaigned on a pledge to build the wall at Mexico's expense, a proposition Mexican officials called ludicrous.
In a televised White House session on Dec. 11, Trump said he would take responsibility for a shutdown over the wall as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said they would not support wall funding.
Trump is effectively sabotaging the Republican Party on his way out of office, obsessed with overturning his election loss and nursing pangs of betrayal from allies whom he had expected to bend the instruments of democracy to his will, Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report. Trump has created a divide in his party as fundamental and impassioned as any during his four years as president … Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican, said the call was 'deeply troubling' and urged all Americans to listen to the hour-long conversation, while Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) condemned it as 'a new low in this whole futile and sorry episode.' Even one of Trump's most loyal defenders, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), said it was 'not a helpful call.' …
-- Democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's Alabama Senate race, which was inspired by Russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: Recent revelations about Project Birmingham … have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. Project Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.
Foster's playing status remains undetermined, as he will need to be cleared by the NFL before he is allowed to return to the field. He has been placed on paid leave as the league conducts its own investigation into the late-November incident.
The DEA soon began bringing enforcement actions against distributors. In 2007, the agency moved against McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor and the fifth-largest corporation in the nation, for failing to report hundreds of suspicious orders placed by Internet pharmacies. McKesson settled the case, paying a $13.2 million fine.
While decisions on alternative dosing regimens reside with health authorities, Pfizer believes it is critical health authorities conduct surveillance efforts on any alternative schedules implemented and to ensure each recipient is afforded the maximum possible protection, which means immunization with two doses of the vaccine, Pitts said.
Trump agreed to take pictures with Manchin that were used in the senator's 2018 campaign, and the president has called him out of the blue just to talk politics while repeatedly asking him to become a Republican. People close to the president said he has more affection for Manchin than any other Senate Democrat, and that he understands the transactional nature of the relationship.
Soon, though, insulin became a commercial enterprise. By 1923, the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly was manufacturing enough insulin for diabetics across North America. For decades, manufacturers improved formulas, first using animal parts, then producing human insulin using bacteria and recombinant DNA. The 1990s saw the advent of insulin analogs, synthetic drugs made to better mimic the body's own insulin production.
Once students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. Kaytlin Roholt graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley during the Gorsuch nomination, and now practices at Jones Day and is a member of the steering committee of the Federalist Society's D.C. chapter for young lawyers. Regardless of where I am, I know that a Federalist Society event is a place where I can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. What we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. Panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. Together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.
At the clinic, a nurse practitioner discussed the potential complications of the chronic disease, including blindness, nerve damage, and kidney and heart problems, according to medical records. Alec came home with prescriptions for two kinds of insulin: One was long-acting; the other gave him short bursts before meals. He wrote on Facebook: Today a lot has changed. … I would never wish this upon anybody. So whoever reads this take care of yourself.
Feb. 23, 2020, issue: When I think of leap day, I think of couples observing their anniversaries once every four years or elderly people celebrating their 21st birthdays. I wanted to go a less obvious route with this — a character who's frustrated because there's an extra day tacked on to what seems like an already very long year.
Gert Berthold, a forensic accountant who served on a military task force in Afghanistan during the height of the war, from 2010 to 2012, said he helped analyze 3,000 Defense Department contracts worth $106 billion to see who was benefiting.
Police said Steven Brandenburg, the Wisconsin pharmacist who tried to ruin hundreds of vaccine doses, was convinced the shots would mutate people's DNA. Brandenburg is waiting for charges after he let spoil 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine, which officials said contained enough doses to inoculate more than 500 people. ( AP
But that last quote betrays Bloomberg's biggest liability here. It's one thing for the policy to have the consequence of targeting minorities; it's another for him to acknowledge that's what it was doing and to say it was justified for that specific reason.
Still, he said he has been repeatedly disappointed with Trump on policy issues. He said he wanted the president to pass a different tax bill, one that didn't provide as big a tax break to corporations. On gun violence, he said he had several substantive conversations with the president, where Trump seemed like he was willing to pass some restrictions on firearms and buck the powerful National Rifle Association, but ultimately did not.
To complicate matters, this moral and ideological debate is usually disguised as scientific judgment. Mathematical modeling indicates that as long as an available vaccine is both safe and effective in older adults, they should be a high priority for vaccination, the U.K. government wrote in its guidance for Covid-19 vaccinations.

Both drug companies and PBMs play a role in escalating drug prices. It's almost like Kabuki theater where one guy points to the other guy and says, 'It's not me, it's him,'  says Jing Luo, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and a faculty member at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies insulin pricing.
Six months later, drug company representatives gathered at the alliance's headquarters in Northern Virginia, for a DEA Strategy Task Force Meeting. The companies included McKesson, Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen, along with several other distributors, including H.D. Smith.
Washington kept giving Pakistan billions of dollars a year to help fight terrorism. Yet Pakistani military and intelligence leaders never stopped supporting the Afghan Taliban and giving sanctuary to its leaders.
Finally, Trump's willingness to demonize certain people (Mexicans, Muslims and the media) while accepting unacceptable behavior from others (white supremacists, racists and armed radicals) damaged the nation. Make America Great Again was a fine slogan as long as it pertained only to business or military strength. But we soon learned that MAGA also stood for Whiteness and the good old days when White men were in charge.
In a second tweet, he said: The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security — and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
I got that email, he says.
One of the problems for Bloomberg here is how thoroughly convenient the timing was of his personal evolution on this issue. Perhaps that's not unheard-of, but it practically slaps you in the face. The other big problem is how vocally he defended the policy. It's not a situation in which he simply continued one of his predecessor's policies and made the most of it; he repeatedly said it was the right thing to do.
Feb. 17, 2019, issue: If you're looking across the pond for relief from the political discord, try again. The United Kingdom is roiled by Brexit, its Parliament remains at loggerheads about how to proceed, and confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging on by a thread. For artist Adriana Bellet, the spectacle is personal: As a Spanish woman married to a British man and living in Sweden, Brexit is not only troubling but downright tragic, she says. For me the worst is the disappearance of a Britain that was warm and welcoming, that took me in and taught me how to be an adult.
The U.S. war on drugs in Afghanistan has imploded at nearly every turn
I just want to make it clear that any facility that's used primarily for inherently religious activities is not going to be covered, H. James Towey, director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, was quoted as saying in a 2005 article in The Washington Post.
Dominion Voting System plans to sue Sidney Powell, another lawyer giving advice to Trump, for defamation. The company, which made the voting machine used in Georgia and elsewhere, is also pushing a similar suit against Trump himself, CEO John Poulos told Axios
What we're asking the Republicans in the Senate to do is to take 'yes' for an answer. We are sending them back exactly, word for word, what they have passed, Pelosi said. Why would they not do that? Is it because the president won't sign it? Did they not hear about the coequal branch of government, and that we the Congress send the president legislation and he can choose to sign or not?

As the impasse dragged on, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said for the first time that the stalemate could continue for months and months. A funding lapse of that length would have compounding consequences for the government's ability to provide promised services, and for the approximately 800,000 federal workers who are either furloughed at home or working without any guarantee of getting paid.
Political action committees representing the industry contributed at least $1.5 million to the 23 lawmakers who sponsored or co-sponsored four versions of the bill, including nearly $100,000 to Marino and $177,000 to Hatch. Overall, the drug industry spent $102 million lobbying Congress on the bill and other legislation between 2014 and 2016, according to lobbying reports.
That same month, Congress passed a bill shutting down Internet pharmacies. Signed by President George W. Bush, it was a major victory for the DEA.
In the Republican-controlled House … the differences between Democrats and Republicans are even greater. House Speaker Paul Ryan has far more hardline immigration hawks in his conference. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, has far more members who are opposed to any kind of deal that set back the parents of DACA recipients either by limiting chain migration or other mechanisms.
I think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

This bill will bring much-needed clarity to critical provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In doing so, we will ensure that the DEA's authorities are not abused and threatened by future legal challenges; foster greater collaboration, communication and transparency between the DEA and the supply chain; create more opportunities to identify bad actors at the end of the supply chain; and, most importantly, be certain that prescriptions are accessible to patients in need.
WHAT THEY SAID IN PRIVATE Dec. 11, 2015 Our money was empowering a lot of bad people. There was massive resentment among the Afghan people. And we were the most corrupt here, so had no credibility on the corruption issue. — Senior U.S. official, Lessons Learned interview
For his part, Crocker told government interviewers he agreed corruption was an enormous problem that had sabotaged the war effort. But by the time the Kabul Bank scandal struck, it was too late, he said.
It's rush hour on a November evening in Washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. The Federalist Society has taken over the Main Hall of Union Station for its annual black-tie gala. The stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of James Madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. Two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.

While healing the nation will take time, I hope we'll return to a less chaotic, normalized situation in the White House. This is the starting point. Now the real work begins.
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
Soon after, Marino and Blackburn introduced a second version, along with 11 co-sponsors.
Feb. 28, 2021, issue: When lockdown started last year, many of us established hobbies to cope with boredom and loneliness. We painted portraits of our pets, pieced together puzzles, baked sourdough bread, folded origami, grew vegetables — the list goes on. Now that the pandemic is entering a second year, it might be time for some new activities.
Drawing partly on the interviews but largely on other government documents, SIGAR published two Lessons Learned reports in 2017 and 2019 that highlighted an array of problems with the Afghan security forces. The reports followed several SIGAR audits and investigations that had pinpointed similar troubles with the Afghan army and police.
We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi said Thursday.
On July 27, a Mallinckrodt security director told DEA Supervisor Paul Pete Kleissle in St. Louis about the Tennessee connection. Kleissle recommended that Mallinckrodt conduct an audit of Sunrise and the company agreed, government documents show.
If it does, then a program aimed at those most likely to spread the disease becomes very easy to defend. To make the decision, we need scientists to tell us whether the vaccine can stop infectiousness, and to identify who should best be vaccinated to halt the pandemic most quickly — both profound and difficult questions.
The bill died in the Senate.
Rep. Marino's office is very open to feedback and additional ideas, Jewelyn Cosgrove, a lobbyist for the alliance, wrote to her colleagues on June 12, 2013.
Diplomats and military commanders acknowledged they struggled to answer simple questions: Who is the enemy? Whom can we count on as allies? How will we know when we have won?
During the Clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the Republican Party itself. Conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife sent investigators to Arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that Bill Clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. Scaife became what The Washington Post called a guiding force behind Gingrich's Contract With America and a later generation of tea party activists. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big Trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said Clinton was responsible for the deaths of countless people.
Top officials at the White House and the Justice Department have declined to discuss how the bill came to pass.

Morhaim — an emergency room physician who led the effort to legalize medical cannabis long before being hired by the company — says his advocacy was motivated by his desire to make marijuana available to patients, not to enrich his company.
In contrast with Bush, Obama imposed strict deadlines and promised to bring home all U.S. troops by the end of his presidency.
In the wake of the Walgreens and Cardinal cases, the industry alliance hired a crisis communications company, APCO Worldwide. In April 2013, the D.C.-based firm created a 44-page Crisis Playbook that proposed responses for the industry in several theoretical scenarios.

But conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the Birchers at the grass roots. At its 1964 national convention, the GOP rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. Birchers such as John Rousselot and John Schmitz served in Congress as Republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch Fred Koch was a founding member of the society. Birchers took active part in Republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as John Stormer's None Dare Call It Treason (about Soviet infiltration of American government) and Fred Schwarz's You Can Trust the Communists (to Be Communists). They served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. Other Republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the Birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control Americans' minds.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday ordered a third national lockdown for England amid a surging coronavirus outbreak driven by a U.K. variant that appears to be more contagious and may have greater implications for children, Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Guarino report. In a televised address to the nation Monday evening, Johnson said the new variant was 50 to 70 percent more transmissible, spreading at a rate he called 'frustrating and alarming.' … The number of patients in London hospitals has more than doubled over the past two weeks. ... Under the new lockdown, everyone in England will be asked to stay at home except in special circumstances. Schools and universities will close for in-class learning with immediate effect.
Rumsfeld disclosed the two memos about the Afghan police when he published a memoir in 2011. The memos and other documents show that Rumsfeld pushed to train the Afghan forces quickly yet wanted to keep them small so the U.S. government would not get stuck with the expense of sustaining a massive foreign army and police force.
The ethics committee report says Morhaim plans to disassociate himself when legally permissible from Doctor's Orders, which last year won preliminary approval from the commission to operate a dispensary.

Here's one example: More than 1 million children have one or both parents in prison. These are the forgotten children, almost six times more likely to go to prison themselves. And they should not be punished for the sins of their fathers. We should give grants to ministries and mentoring programs that offer support and love and concern for these children. Let us bring hope and help to these other innocent victims of crime. I'm not calling for government to step back from its responsibilities, but to share in them. We'll always need government to raise and distribute funds, to monitor success and set standards. But we also need what no government can provide, the power of compassion and prayer and love. (APPLAUSE) These are some of my goals for America to help make opportunity not only a hope and a promise, but a living reality. The NAACP and the GOP have not always been allies. I know that. But recognizing our past and confronting the future with a common vision, by doing that, I believe we can find common ground. It won't be easy work, but a philosopher once advised, when given a choice, prefer the hard. We will prefer the hard, because only the hard will achieve the good. That's my commitment, and that is our opportunity. Thank you for having me, and God bless America.
The alliance also noted that the bill was approved by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama.
We will get this done for our great Miners! Trump wrote on Jan. 10 in a quote-tweet of Manchin's month-old tweet promoting the deal over the legislation.
The investigation seemed to stall there, but the events in Tennessee would later prove significant.
They made it and camouflaged it so well all of us were fooled, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said. All of us. Nobody knew. That bill has to be retracted, has to be repealed.
The U.S. government should take into account the amount of assistance a host country can absorb, and agencies should improve their ability to effectively monitor this assistance, the report stated. U.S. strategies and plans should incorporate anticorruption objectives into security and stability goals, rather than viewing anticorruption as imposing trade-offs on those goals.
Supporters of drug testing sites acknowledge that there is no safe level of drug consumption, and participants in those tests usually have to sign disclaimers acknowledging that. In some cases, assistance is provided only if participants also attend short counseling sessions on drug use.
President George W. Bush established the network of faith-based offices across the federal government to help government work with faith-based nonprofits. President Barack Obama continued them, but Trump has not filled most of the key positions in the network, though he's not formally killed it.
Ultimately, of course, to the distress of most Federalists, the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012. Yet to Barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. Instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, Chief Justice Roberts found other grounds to support the law.

She is not Bernie Sanders. Plenty of the Democrats who wanted to draft Warren into the 2016 race went on to support the Vermont senator; a good number of those strategists, activists and voters now support him even with Warren in the race. But Warren's approach to campaigning could not be more different. The Sanders approach, which has not changed in decades, is to sketch out a social democratic vision of America — universal health care, free public college tuition, a $15 minimum wage — in sentences punctuated by applause. He mentions his biography only to talk about how he proved skeptics wrong as mayor of Burlington. Voters who show up to hear Sanders hear the message, and then they decide whether they're in.
What don't we know? Well, for the first time since 2004, Democrats have a wide-open primary field with no establishment favorite, and not much of an establishment to decide on one. The 2008 and 2016 primaries eventually settled into battles between Clinton, representing the old party leadership, and a candidate who could define himself as a change agent. Some Democrats see Joe Biden potentially filling that establishment role, but none see him consolidating party support the way Clinton did.
Please take a look, Rumsfeld wrote in a memo, accompanying the report. This is the Afghan National Police situation. It is a serious problem. My impression is that these two pages were written in as graceful and non-inflammatory a way as is possible.
That's not how things work here, however. To believe all that is a fiction of its own.
* PAUL RYAN EXPLAINS WHITE HOUSE POSITION TO TRUMP: Trump yesterday got confused and tweeted opposition to a surveillance bill supported by the White House and most Republicans. The Post reports on what came next:
In October 2004, the Pentagon distributed a set of talking points that bragged about the Afghan army and police. The document praised the 15,000 soldiers in the nascent Afghan army as a highly professional, multi-ethnic force, which is rapidly becoming a pillar of the country's security.
Rannazzisi believed the message was clear: Back off.
The students announced a national symposium to be held at Yale in the spring of 1982. Word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that Otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. Daniel Kelly was a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. Thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from Worcester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's Yale dorm. They were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, Kelly recalls, which is when you look at the Constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. Kelly is now head of the Federalist Society lawyers chapter in Boston, where, in late October, Sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.
Diament said while Bush refused to change the policy explicitly, his staff found ways to get many — not all — churches FEMA funds. The rules were applied flexibly he said, with the government focusing on the parts of houses of worship that could be characterized as not exclusively religious — like community halls that serve the homeless, for example.
Biden and Pence also campaigned in Georgia on Monday.
Update: Bloomberg's team has released a statement saying: President Trump's deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans. I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95 percent, but I should've done it faster and sooner. I regret that, and I have apologized — and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and Latino communities.
President Trump has said he wants to withdraw more U.S. troops, and his diplomats are engaged in peace talks with the Taliban. But during his presidency, U.S. military aircraft have pounded Afghanistan each month with three times as many bombs and missiles, on average, as they dropped per month during President Barack Obama's second term, according to Air Force statistics.
Hatch asked Rosenberg how he saw the partnership between the DEA and the industry evolving.
The traditional liberal response to the Federalist Society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. The conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the Constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. Those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the Constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.

In 2016, the drug companies convinced members of Congress and Obama administration officials to rein in the DEA and force the agency to treat them as partners in efforts to solve the crisis. The crowning achievement of the companies was a piece of legislation known as the Marino bill, named after its original sponsor, which curbed the DEA's ability to immediately suspend the operations of drug companies that failed to follow the law.
Well, hell, it wasn't for a lack of trying, Manchin said he responded, mentioning that Trump visited West Virginia multiple times.
Rannazzisi said he never said the bill would protect criminals.
Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2004, said the Afghan government wanted Washington to pay for security forces of 100,000 to 120,000.

The present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, Molina said. I'm actually more concerned about Medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.
While I have consistently maintained — and do today — that I did nothing wrong and complied with all laws, that was not enough, Morhaim wrote. The harsh fact is that being technically right is not enough. But Morhaim, who declined additional comment on the report, also said in his letter that he remains unsure about what he did wrong. I am concerned about the fairness of a process that penalizes members who comply with the clear letter of the law, but who can be found to violate the 'spirit' of the law.
Patients who struggle to afford insulin sometimes ration their supply to make it last longer — a dangerous practice that can create disabling or deadly complications. It's very shortsighted to skimp on insulin, says Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist and diabetes researcher at Yale School of Medicine. In the long term, it's going to cost us much more. Poor glycemic control can lead to blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart disease and stroke. In the short term, patients who stop taking enough insulin can lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition where blood sugars get too high and the body's blood becomes acidic. It can become fatal in just hours or a few days.
In his letter to lawmakers, Morhaim said he made mistakes and failed to appreciate public perception of these issues.
I think we are close, she said. She said that the agency is working as fast as possible on the tests, but that the priority is making sure they are accurate.

The Georgia runoff has an explicitly racist history. In an hour-long special episode of the excellent Post Reports podcasts, our colleagues Martine Powers and Ted Muldoon report the runoff system was conceived in the 1960s by a staunch segregationist who proclaimed that runoffs would prevent the Negro bloc vote from controlling the elections. You can find a full transcript of their report here, but the part about the Jim Crow origins of the runoff system starts at about the 26-minute mark. Essentially, the Georgia system was invented to subvert the mandates of the Voting Rights Act and ensure White candidates for statewide offices would always have an edge. Even now, the runoff system essentially serves to ensure many votes from Black, Brown, rural, and low-income people don't ultimately get counted. It's a fascinating, albeit depressing, story.
In his December 2016 Lessons Learned interview, Crocker said the only way to force Pakistan to change would be for Trump to keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan indefinitely and give them the green light to hunt the Taliban on Pakistani territory.
Marino declined to be interviewed for this story, but last year he told The Post:
This army and this police force have been very, very effective in combat against the insurgents every single day, then-Army Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley said during a 2013 press briefing from Kabul. Have there been one or two outposts that have been overrun? Yes. But you're talking about 3,000 to 4,000 outposts that are in the country.
Mallinckrodt knew through law enforcement reports that Barry Schultz was diverting controlled substances, and that the diverted oxycodone was supplied by Mallinckrodt through Sunrise, prosecutors later wrote in an internal document sent to the company. When Mallinckrodt continued to distribute oxycodone to Sunrise for such purposes, and continued to pay incentives in the form of chargebacks for the product sales to Barry Schultz, Mallinckrodt was diverting oxycodone.

Trump reportedly reacted to a discussion of that last component of the deal by saying: Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here? before suggesting the United States should instead allow in more people from countries like Norway. Trump now claims he only used tough language about this deal, but his reported comments illuminate his actual policy stance: Trump is, in fact, rejecting the deal because it lets in too many people from what he thinks are shithole countries, or lets too many of them remain.
Of the hundreds of people interviewed by SIGAR, Burns was one of the few who accepted personal responsibility for his role in the war's failures.
The bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.
The overwhelming majority, 99 plus percent, are our allies in this thing, Rosenberg said.

Officials at the DEA declined to comment for this article. The U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. Our office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions, acting U.S. attorney Daniel Lemisch said. This is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. As this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.
But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.
The bill also was reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget.
Defendants have accomplished this by means including but not limited to various and rampant purported use exemptions, drug testing exemptions and by failure to enforce its own policies, states the lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court in Nevada on Tuesday.

The agency declined to make Mulrooney available for an interview.

There is a lot of disagreement in the scientific literature about the herd immunity threshold, which is certain to vary from place to place. I don't think anyone responsible would confidently say what it is, and would never put forward a single number for the U.S. as a whole. Rather, the key question is how rapidly we inoculate people who have a high risk of mortality conditional on infection — most older folks and some late middle-aged folks with severe chronic conditions. Prioritizing them for vaccination will yield the greatest benefit in reducing covid-19-related mortality, regardless of when herd immunity is hit.

These corporate entities are powerful special interests. In 2017, the pharmaceutical and health product industry — which includes drug companies and PBMs — spent nearly $280 million on lobbying, the biggest spender by far of 20 top industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even some patient advocacy organizations, like the American Diabetes Association, receive millions in funding from pharmaceutical companies. The industry also has a revolving door to government. Alex Azar, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, was the president of Eli Lilly's U.S. division until 2017. Under his watch, the price of the company's analog insulin doubled. Now he is tasked with overseeing the government's plan to lower those same prices.

His mother helped him look for a health plan on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, but his options were expensive. To keep going to the same doctors, she says, he was looking at paying about $450 monthly, in addition to a high deductible of more than $7,000, which would mean months of paying out-of-pocket for most of his medical care. He opted to go without insurance, forgoing that expense to focus on paying for his insulin and supplies until he could find a better option.

May 26, 2019, issue: When a city is inundated with visitors, like Washington in the summer, it can feel transformed by the tourists' gaze. Trying to capture a foreign space often means we voraciously consume it faster than we digest it, and only engage with the most superficial part of its identity. Still, it's easy to forget that where you're fortunate to live and work is the same place where others plan to spend their vacations.
Speaking at Trump's Georgia rally, Kelly Loeffler – whose name appears on the ballot in today's runoff – became the 13th GOP senator to publicly announce that she will oppose certifying Biden's victory. She declared that she is going to try to get the legally certified electoral votes from her own state thrown out, as opposed to letting them be counted for Biden. The effort will fail. But it is notable that Loeffler is willing to effectively disenfranchise the 10.62 million people she is supposed to represent – since she has tied her political fortunes entirely to the lame-duck Trump.
For years, some drug distributors were fined for repeatedly ignoring warnings from the DEA to shut down suspicious sales of hundreds of millions of pills, while they racked up billions of dollars in sales.
This occurred despite internal warnings. Kristine Atwell, who managed the Jupiter center, said of one pharmacy, I don't know how they can even house this many bottle[s] to be honest. How do we go about checking the validity of these orders? according to an email now part of the Cleveland case.
At Yale New Haven Health, the system's hospitals also keep a list of those already signed up but who are flexible with appointment timing, so that if extra doses remain at any point or there is a no-show, one of those employees is notified and vaccinated, spokeswoman Dana Marnane said in an email. To date, she said, 14,500 Yale health-care providers have been immunized.
But Trump's standing on the issue aside, this is the day Bloomberg's campaign had to know was coming, and the questions about it are thoroughly valid. Bloomberg finally disowned the stop-and-frisk policy when he began running for president, but he had previously defended it to the hilt. It's not unreasonable to consider this his biggest obstacle to the Democratic nomination, especially given the important role minority voters will play after Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.
I've been told the DEA's relationship with supply chain stakeholders has improved since you've taken the helm at DEA, the senator said. I want to just say I applaud your efforts on this front.

The intent of the law was not to decrease the DEA's enforcement against distributors, the alliance said in a statement. HDA believed that the legislation would help provide greater clarity to one element of DEA's enforcement standards and encourage communication and coordination that was much-needed between the DEA and the industry.
An executive at distributor H.D. Smith wrote to his bosses after executives from several companies gathered for a meeting on DEA strategy.
-- These are the kinds of significant questions that would typically be hashed out during an interagency process before a public announcement. A review of the timeline illustrates how erratic the Trump administration's rhetoric has been:
He said it would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs. Leonhart, then the DEA administrator, vehemently opposed the bill, according to Rannazzisi and other DEA officials.
In many of those cases, kratom was used along with other drugs, making it difficult for authorities to determine the actual cause of death. Kratom proponents have said the government sometimes blames kratom for deaths caused by other substances, but the new fatality cited by the FDA, given the absence of other substances, reinforces our concerns, Gottlieb said.
In September 2016, SIGAR published a 164-page report that chronicled how corruption had harmed the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and that made recommendations for tackling the problem.
Linden Barber, who left the DEA and set up a law practice to represent the industry he once regulated, had warned that the agency's legal office could lose cases on appeal. The office eventually raised the agency's internal standard of proof for bringing enforcement actions from a preponderance of evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt, according to former DEA supervisors and lawyers. The number of cases brought by Rannazzisi's team plummeted.
June 9, 2019, issue: The ideal of the family vacation is often far from the reality: There's the joy of spending time with your loved ones vs. the irritation of, well, actually being around them. We inevitably project great hopes onto summer vacation, and while those can be dashed, the beauty is that — come next year — we'll probably sign up to do it all over again.

The U.S. flooded the country with money — then turned a blind eye to the graft it fueled
I expect daily life to feel more normal by sometime this summer, but I think it will be 2022 before some mitigation measures can be fully relaxed. And I expect that our society will feel ongoing consequences of this pandemic — physical, mental, emotional, and economic — for years to come.
For much of the war, Washington paid the salaries of the security forces by transferring huge sums of money to the Afghan government, which in turn paid soldiers and police officers in cash — after commanders often took an illicit cut for themselves, according to the interviews and news reports.
The law was the crowning achievement of a multifaceted campaign by the drug industry to weaken aggressive DEA enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market. The industry worked behind the scenes with lobbyists and key members of Congress, pouring more than a million dollars into their election campaigns.
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was dubious about the law when he was a senator and had concluded that it should be changed. Forty-four state attorneys general, as well as congressional Democrats, also called for repeal. Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said the new law handcuffs the DEA.

The new information is emerging through the efforts of lawyers in the massive federal lawsuit against two dozen drug companies in Cleveland who have obtained depositions from high-ranking company officials, internal company emails and confidential memos. The documents were unsealed in July after a year-long legal fight by The Washington Post and the owner of the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia.
Can a candidate like Warren break through in a race with a credible, female black candidate? She's finding out.
Hatch praised the DEA's new chief.
Crocker also said he was sympathetic to a counterargument from the Afghan president, who spread the blame more broadly.
But it concluded that Morhaim's actions nevertheless were improper and contrary to the principles of state ethics law.
Warren's announcement can be fairly seen as the start of the 2020 Democratic primary. The question for Democratic voters is whom to nominate; the question for the press is whether we've learned anything from a 2016 campaign that made fools out of many experts. Plenty of first-look commentary on Warren is repeating the mistake that led many to suggest that Donald Trump could not win the 2016 Republican nomination, or that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would be, at best, a token challenger for Hillary Clinton.
-- Some federal prison employees expressed frustration about serving meals of steak and Cornish hen to inmates as they work without pay. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: For inmates at [Florida's Coleman Federal Correctional Complex], New Year's Day lunch was grilled steak, steamed rice with gravy, black-eyed peas, green beans, macaroni and cheese, a choice of garlic biscuits or whole wheat bread and an assortment of holiday pies. The feast was served by not-particularly-festive prison guards and workers who have no idea when they will receive their next paycheck — but who have to come to work anyway because they work in crucial public safety jobs.
Manchin has also been critical of how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) handled the run-up to the trial, but he has declined to criticize the president, saying he wants to weight the evidence against him.
It's a lot of unknown in the sense that there are 44 new members in the House and 17 new members in the Senate, said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert). We are waiting to hear some of the ideas they will be bringing forward. Some of them campaigned from the left; some campaigned from the right.
One was Betsy Christian, who, according to the article, posted on Facebook: OK, judge me. Daughter, spouse and I got the vaccine today. We have no underlying conditions, aren't elderly and aren't front-line workers. She said the father of her daughter's roommate had told them that the extra vaccines would go bad if not used today.
In the Lessons Learned interviews, officials said the United States and NATO deserved a large share of the blame. They said the training programs for the Afghan security forces — not just the police — were ill-designed, poorly coordinated and thinly staffed.
Turning to me, Conway says: That's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … He's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the District. … The younger people really feel it, and their view is: This will end, the current era. And they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.
Dostum, in a 2014 interview with The Post, denied receiving such payouts, as well as the other allegations against him. If I were a danger, I would have done something in the past 13 years, he said, adding, This is just propaganda against me.
And he says, 'You know, I know you think we're hedging our bets. You're right, we are, because one day you'll be gone again, it'll be like Afghanistan the first time, you'll be done with us, but we're still going to be here because we can't actually move the country. And the last thing we want with all of our other problems is to have turned the Taliban into a mortal enemy, so, yes, we're hedging our bets.'

With the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.
All seven counties have white majorities. Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, is 91 percent white. Yet five of the new sheriffs defeated white incumbents. Another beat the retiring sheriff's white heir apparent. The seventh, Cumberland County's Ennis Wright, was appointed in 2017 to fill a vacancy and faced voters for the first time.

Vaccinations are off to a sluggish start across the D.C. region. In Maryland, less than one-quarter of the state's initial batch of 273,875 vaccines has been used. In Virginia, it's only one-fifth of the state's allotment of 451,075 doses. In D.C., the number stands at about 17,000 of 40,075 delivered doses. In one D.C. case, two men who are not in priority to receive the vaccine were given their shots after first responders missed their appointments for a vaccination at a Giant Foods supermarket. A pharmacist approached the two men and asked if they wanted to get the Moderna shots since the product would go bad if it wasn't used immediately. (Greg Schneider, Michael Brice-Saddler and Erin Cox)
This version also would have made proving cases more difficult for the DEA, according to former federal officials. It defined imminent danger as a case in which a company intentionally distributed or dispensed drugs in a manner that poses a present or foreseeable risk of serious adverse health consequences or death.
Even before the new commander in chief moved into the White House, U.S. military leaders recognized they needed a fresh war plan. Years of hunting suspected terrorists was getting them nowhere. The Taliban kept gaining ground.
Slaoui went on to say that discussions were ongoing between regulators and Moderna about a two-dose regimen of half doses. But the agency's statement rebutted that idea, specifying that changes such as reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, using a half dose instead of a full dose, or mixing and matching vaccines to immunize more people would not be supported by the current evidence.
I asked that why is it possible that a large number of about 500 security forces cannot defeat about 20 or 30 Taliban.

By anonymously revealing those findings to affected festivalgoers, researchers persuaded more than two-thirds of them to hand over other substances in their possession. Drug-related hospital admissions fell 95 percent compared with the previous year — a trend researchers said was largely associated with the on-site drug testing trial. In a separate experiment, researchers in Austria similarly noticed that tests raised awareness about the dangers of drug consumption.
For those reasons, the DEA did not raise a red flag with Justice, the official said. The Post has previously reported that a White House official, speaking anonymously, said that neither the DEA nor the Justice Department raised objections to the bill.
Barber played a key role in crafting an early version of the legislation that would eventually curtail the DEA's power, according to an internal email written by a Justice Department official to a colleague. He wrote the Marino bill, the official wrote in 2014.
Trump himself made an appearance in the White House briefing room, where, flanked by members of the union for Border Patrol agents, he said he has never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance on border security . . . and for, frankly, the wall, or the barrier.
Freitas, the alliance official, was concerned that the questions could be traced back to the outside lobbying firm, co-founded by Carlyle P. Thorsen, according to emails unsealed in the Cleveland case.
We are only beginning to glimpse the damage that Trump is doing to America's standing in the world.
First we got blown off by the company, he said, and then we got blown off by our own lawyers.
By the time Obama took office in 2009, al-Qaeda had largely vanished from Afghanistan. But the Taliban had made a comeback.
Miller, who is marking his 44th year in the General Assembly, sounded optimistic about the prospects for a $15 minimum wage in the state, a proposal pushed for years by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and one that left-leaning groups blamed Miller for blocking.
The overwhelming majority, 99 plus percent, are our allies in this thing, Rosenberg testified. What we need is them as partners.
Remember when conservative pundits and some reporters were telling us how Trump's ability to sit through an immigration meeting showcased his blazing competence?
That may have been before he read all his mail. Trump went on to bash retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal over remarks McChrystal made Sunday, calling the president untruthful and immoral.  'General' McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover! Trump opined.

At the heart of the issue is a philosophical problem that has bedeviled the West (where individual liberties remain far more important than in Asia) throughout the long months of the pandemic. At the risk of oversimplification, it is the battle between the ideas represented by Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.
One warlord who was both loved and hated by U.S. officials was Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, the governor of Helmand province from 2001 to 2005. Dubbed SMA by Americans, he was renowned for ruthlessly enforcing order.
The partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:

In hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. I ran into Josh Blackman, the Texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. All the action does go on in the hallway, he told me.

As long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.

Questionable motivations and loyalties snaked through the ranks of the army and police. Ethnic and tribal tensions posed a perpetual problem, with the officer corps dominated by warlords who doled out promotions based on patronage, according to the interviews.
A DEA investigation of the Jupiter facility found that Walgreens failed to maintain an effective system for detecting suspicious orders.
Investigators soon determined Kabul Bank had falsified its books to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in unsecured loans to politically connected business executives, including the president's brother Mahmoud Karzai and the family of Fahim Khan, the warlord then serving as the country's first vice president.

The United States is like a muscle car that's been beaten down, but perhaps it can be restored to its former glory, and even improved on in the process. It feels better knowing the car is in the shop, at least — not careering down a highway with no brakes.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler — a former lobbyist for the coal, chemical and uranium industries — will announce the final rule at a virtual session hosted today by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. That think tank disputes the idea that climate change poses a major threat. Although Biden will probably seek to overturn this, such an effort will take months, if not longer.
The U.S. is shattering hospitalization records.
There is much for this crowd to celebrate. The conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. Brett Kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his Yale Law School days, has just been elevated to the Supreme Court; he is the second of President Trump's appointees, following Neil Gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. They join Justice Clarence Thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the Federalist Society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), Chief Justice John Roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and Justice Samuel Alito (a periodic speaker at society events). The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning. In practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.

The new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.

The purpose of prosperity is to ensure the American dream touches every willing heart. And we cannot afford to have an America segregated by class, by race, or by aspiration. America must close the gap of hope between communities of prosperity and communities of poverty. We have seen what happens--we've seen what happens when African-American citizens have the opportunity they've earned and the respect that they deserve. Men and women once victimized by Jim Crow have risen to leadership in the halls of Congress. (APPLAUSE) Professionals and entrepreneurs have built a successful and growing and ever stronger African-American middle class. It must be our goal to expand this opportunity, to make it as broad and diverse as America its success--America itself. And this begins by enforcing the civil rights laws. (APPLAUSE) Discrimination is still a reality, even when it takes different forms. Instead of Jim Crow, there's racial redlining and profiling. Instead of separate but equal, there is separate and forgotten. Strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration. (APPLAUSE) And I will confront another form of bias: the soft bigotry of low expectations. (APPLAUSE) Several months ago I visited Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, where African-Americans confronted injustice and white Americans confronted their conscience. In 43 years, we have come so far in opening the doors of our schools. But today we have a challenge of our own. While all can enter our schools, many--too many, are not learning there.
I think you mean 'will enough Americans be vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold?' My answer is possibly not because we don't know if the vaccines protect enough against transmission for the threshold to be achievable, and because the new variant may increase that threshold substantially.
These measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

I think a lot of people, myself included, think it's very likely this virus might be circulating at low levels in the United States right now. We can't know for sure because we haven't seen it, said Michael Mina, associate medical director of clinical microbiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He said the optimal testing scenario for flu is a 30-minute turnaround on a test, but right now, shipping samples to Atlanta to test for coronavirus means a 48-hour wait.

But Trump won the election, and ever since his insults have been perceived, by the press, as masterful distractions that no Democrat can effectively rebut. Since her DNA test, Warren has simply stopped responding to Trump's insults; over four Iowa events, she mentioned the president's name only once, when asked about the aforementioned test, saying that she simply could not stop him from hurling racial slurs.
The USDA is working to finalize a new rule that would make the increased line speeds permanent and expand them to other poultry plants, although it is unclear if the administration will be able to push the change through before Joe Biden takes office. Critics worry that such a rule change could harm worker safety even beyond the coronavirus. Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other illnesses are common among people who work in meatpacking plants.
In January 2015, Marino and Blackburn introduced a third version of the bill in the House. The next month, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the powerful chairman of the Finance Committee, introduced it in the Senate. The bill was called S.483.
It was followed by a flurry of DEA memos. One said, This bill is without basis in case law or Congressional findings. Another said the bill would constitute perhaps the greatest reduction in the Attorney General's authority under the Controlled Substances Act since the Act's passage in 1970.

At the Yale Diabetes Center, Lipska and her colleagues recently found that one in four diabetic patients reported rationing insulin because of the cost. Very few of those patients were uninsured, but their out-of-pocket expenses still created a financial burden.

-- Trump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy, David Weigel writes. When Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the 'million dollars a day' that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.
Morhaim later told The Post that Dea Daly, the General Assembly's ethics adviser, had cleared his dual roles.

Nicole got the call that Alec had died on a Tuesday. It was Laine who found him. She hadn't heard from him since Sunday night, so she went to his apartment to check on him. He was on the floor beside his bed. I grabbed his shoulder, and it was ice cold, Laine says. I just knew he was gone.
I'd like to discuss that with you to see if we can support each other in the 'DEA-Created' mess, Crowley said. I can certainly commiserate with you about DEA actions from a select few individual crusaders in their Headquarters.
Oct. 18, 2020, issue: I'm drawn to ideas surrounding our longing for and consumption of something at all costs — even when it is plainly bad for us, like these huge lollipops.

Murphy said he had heard the same thing from drug dealers.
A spokeswoman for the state attorney's office in Hillsborough County, which made the decision to drop the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
The problem confronting everyone in the West is that we aren't even talking about this stuff. Moral choices are unavoidable. We need to understand them, discuss them as a society and come to conclusions. Then we need to apply the science to those choices. Western institutions have so far proved wholly unable to stage such a public discussion.
Trump, who is reported to be wary of going toe-to-toe with Bloomberg and his essentially limitless resources, tweeted the clip Tuesday morning, saying, WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!

From there, the story of the Federalist Society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. That's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. My admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen Federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual Federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.

One of the most recent departures was Jason Hadges, the senior DEA attorney overseeing pharmaceutical enforcement cases who, according to former agency supervisors and lawyers, had been demanding a higher standard of proof on cases. Hadges left the DEA in May to join the pharmaceutical and biotechnology regulatory division of Hogan Lovells, a high-powered D.C. law firm. He declined to comment, citing client sensitivities.

For a long time, authorities at festivals in Australia and elsewhere almost entirely focused on preventing people from taking drugs in the first place. That approach has done little to drive down the number of drug-related deaths, however, and a mounting body of research suggests that pill-testing facilities might be a more promising strategy.
Hunt's case rests on the UFC's anti-doping policy, which is overseen by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Under the policy, retired fighters are supposed to undergo four months of random drug testing before being allowed to once again compete. The UFC, however, granted an exemption for Lesnar under a clause that allows the promotion to waive the mandatory tests under exceptional circumstances.

Whether older adults 'should' be high priority depends on what we want to achieve through a vaccination policy. And that involves value choices. Distribution of Covid-19 vaccines will need to maximize the public health benefits of the limited availability, or reduce the burden on the NHS, or save as many lives as possible from Covid-19. These are not necessarily the same thing and a choice among them is an ethical choice.

But internally, Bush administration officials shared anxieties and sounded alarms. In February 2005, Rumsfeld forwarded a confidential report to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the Afghan National Police, or ANP. The report was titled ANP Horror Stories and described how most of the police were illiterate, underequipped and barely trained.
I've been told the DEA's relationship with supply chain stakeholders has improved since you've taken the helm at DEA, Hatch said. I want to just say I applaud your efforts on this front.
Prosecutors said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA. But the company said it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered.
The president then laughed and said, Oh, Joe, you know I like you, according to Manchin. The senator said he shrugged it off and they had lunch for almost two hours.
In light of Trump's apparent claim that he wants to prioritize people from countries such as Norway, the uglier white nationalist cast of all of this is inescapable. Trump's fellow travelers have gone to great lengths to obscure this basic reality. In a now-infamous exchange, CNN's Jim Acosta asked White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller whether Trump's policies are designed to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country. Miller reacted with outrage and repeatedly cast the goal as reducing the mere numbers of immigrants — ostensibly to protect U.S. workers from competition — which he said was in keeping with previous periods of lower immigration.

Two former U.S. deputy attorneys general have defended Cardinal, one of the Big Three companies, along with McKesson and AmerisourceBergen, that together control 85 percent of drug distribution in the United States. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for WilmerHale, was deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton. Craig S. Morford, Cardinal's chief legal and compliance officer, was acting deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush.
But Manchin is the only one they consider able to be swayed not only by politics back home but also by his relationship with the president, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss issues involving the impeachment trial.
Still, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.
But in truth, the stew of alternative facts has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. The GOP had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories — about scheming bureaucrats, Jews, the Federal Reserve, the United Nations — and its leaders often saw them as absurd. But they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. So the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. It's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; Trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.
More than 350,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the United States this year and more than 20 million cases have been recorded.
Barber's move turned out to be a key moment in the struggle between drug companies and the government, but it was far from the only one. Dozens of top officials from the DEA and Justice Department have stepped through Washington's revolving door to work for drug companies.
At times, the wild-eyed conspiracism came from the top. Vice President Spiro Agnew delivered speeches identifying a cabal of Washington- and New York-based power brokers who supposedly controlled the news media, whipping up what journalists at the time considered a frenzy of anti-Semitism on the far right. (In 1976, a few years after he'd been indicted on bribery and other charges, Agnew published a novel pushing the anti-Semitic trope that the media's Zionist lobby was controlling America's foreign policy in the Middle East.)

There are three factors that will independently determine when enough Americans will either be protected from covid-19 via vaccination or development of antibody following actual infection.
Meanwhile, for all the Federalist Society's steamrolling progress on display, I detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. Near the conclusion of the gala, while McGahn and McConnell are still gloating, I notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. It's George Conway III, husband of Trump communications counselor Kellyanne Conway. George is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to McGahn and McConnell.
The growth in the size and capability of the Afghan security forces and control of territory by those forces is robbing the Taliban of their propaganda target and bringing us closer to the success of the mission, then-Sen.

My sense was that all were pretty passionate about going after this, except Cardinal, Twitty wrote in the email. More to come.
On April 7, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held its hearing.
Public health officials have reassured the public that the new variant does not appear to be more deadly or cause people to get sicker, and they say the leading vaccines will still be effective against it. But the Atlantic's Zeynep Tufekci argues that a more transmissible virus may be far more dangerous than a more deadly strain due to the mathematics of exponential growth, as each new infected person infects more people. With vaccinations lagging, a new variant could be potentially catastrophic.
First, when will there be sufficient vaccine produced and distributed so everyone can receive their two doses? This includes vaccinating those who may have immune protection from actual infection but are vaccinated anyway to increase durable protection. Second, will enough people agree to be vaccinated? And finally, what is the durability of vaccine-induced protection over time?
Trump has interacted with Manchin — a brawny, backslapping former governor — more than any Democrat in the Senate. Manchin has come over for movie screenings, including Darkest Hour, the 2017 historical drama about Winston Churchill, and the president has given him tours of the family residence and his private study.
She's not focused on Donald Trump. In 2016, as the primaries were winding down, Warren began attacking Trump on Twitter, branding him a xenophobic bully as he fired back with attacks on her claim of Native American heritage. At the time, Democrats insisted the senator was cracking a code. She's showing that the best way to respond is to punch back hard and to call him out, former Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor told the New York Times.

I think it is absolutely essentially that we protect the Mueller investigation, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa this weekend after being asked about Tlaib. The special prosecutor has already produced more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas. Our job right now in Congress is to protect that investigation, and we need bipartisan legislation to do that. Mueller needs to complete his investigation and make a full report to the American people.
Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, drug companies are required to report unusually large or otherwise suspicious orders. Failure to do so can result in fines and the suspension or loss of DEA registrations to manufacture or distribute narcotics.

The Rumsfeld memos were released by the Pentagon in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed in 2017 by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research institute at George Washington University.

U.S. advisers constantly tried to plug holes in the system to prevent looting and stealing but said they were often stymied by Afghan government officials who did not want things to change.
The DEA had always relied on drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies to police themselves by monitoring suspicious orders and reporting them to the agency. It was essentially an honor system. The flow of pharmaceuticals was simply too immense for the DEA to monitor on its own.
Blacks and Latinos are becoming an increasingly larger share of the population and the electorate, and that's beginning to have a political effect, he said. This may be a precursor for North Carolina being a battleground in 2020.
The industry alliance told The Post recently that the law did not weaken the DEA's ability to issue immediate suspension orders against drug companies and cited 2017 testimony from Demetra Ashley, then acting chief of the agency's Diversion Control division.
Despite the rising death rate in West Virginia — the highest in the nation — Geldhof said his pleas in 2013 to halt Miami-Luken's operations were ignored by the legal office at headquarters.
Virulent corruption compromised the security forces in other ways. Over time, the Afghan public became so disgusted by all the bribery and extortion that many questioned who represented the bigger evil — the Taliban or the Afghan government.

Afghan security forces, despite years of training, were dogged by incompetence and corruption
President Trump said he may declare a national emergency to get funding for his border wall depending on how negotiations develop:
While the Federalist Society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. Ever since the founding symposium at Yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. The group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders Charles and David Koch.
But Obama's strategy was also destined to fail. U.S., NATO and Afghan officials told government interviewers that it tried to accomplish too much, too quickly, and depended on an Afghan government that was corrupt and dysfunctional.
Consequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.

In addition, the news organizations cited a law review article by the DEA's chief administrative law judge, John J. Mulrooney II, who wrote that the Marino bill imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority.
Of course, no one purveys these theories with as much verve as Trump. The president has suggested that the nation's first African American president was born abroad (he wasn't), that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had a part in JFK's assassination (he didn't), that Ukraine rather than Russia was responsible for election interference (it wasn't), that the Mueller investigation empaneled by his own administration was a Democratic plot against him, that the Clintons orchestrated the prison killing of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who committed suicide, according to an autopsy) and that the Obama administration spied on his campaign, a claim most recently debunked by the Justice Department's inspector general.
Over the course of the war, U.S. military officials have made distinctions in their appraisal of the Afghan security forces. Despite its problems, there is a consensus that the army has made strides and earned a measure of respect from the Afghan public. Elite special-operations units often receive praise for their combat effectiveness.
Yet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.
The army and police have suffered so many casualties that the Afghan government keeps the exact numbers a secret to avoid destroying morale. Estimates are that more than 60,000 members of Afghan security forces have been killed, about 17 times the number of U.S. and NATO troops who have lost their lives.
If this person had returned from mainland China, they would have been tested for coronavirus, the official said. The patient recovered and was discharged to their home.

In a statement Sunday, National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith acknowledged that the administration's practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. … Congressional Democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.
2016: 197,713 deaths from prescription opioid overdoses since 2000.
To create communities of promise, we must help people build the confidence and faith to achieve their own dreams. We must put government squarely on the side of opportunity. There's a higher and older tradition in my party. Lincoln argued that every poor man should have a chance. He defended a clear path for all. He financed colleges and welcomed immigrants, promoted railroads and economic development. Through the Homestead Act, he gave countless Americans a piece of land for a start in a life. I propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit of Lincoln's reforms, a plan to remove obstacles on the road to the middle class. You see, instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them move beyond it. And here's some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative--just some of the thoughts. We must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of the cost of basic health policy for low-income families. We must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in this great land, to own a part of the American dream. We would allow low-income families to use up to a year's worth of Section 8 rental payments to make a down-payment on their own home, then use five years of those payments to help with the mortgage. (APPLAUSE) We'll start an American dream down-payment fund, matching individual savings to the down-payment for a home. Behind these last two proposals is a simple belief: I believe in private property.

The U.S. war on drugs in Afghanistan has imploded at nearly every turn
The nation's public health laboratories, exasperated by the malfunctioning tests in the face of a global public health emergency, have taken the unusual step of appealing to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to develop and use their own tests. In Hawaii, authorities are so alarmed about the lack of testing ability that they requested permission from the CDC to use tests from Japan. A medical director at a hospital laboratory in Boston is developing an in-house test, but is frustrated that his laboratory won't be able to use it without going through an onerous and time-consuming review process, even if demand surges.

Advocates were rallying around the hashtag #insulin4all, which the nonprofit organization T1International helped create in 2014 to raise awareness about the inaccessibility of insulin, particularly in developing countries. T1International's founder, Elizabeth Pfiester, an American Type 1 diabetic who now lives in the United Kingdom, still marvels at how much more affordable diabetes care is in her adopted country. It's really a shame that #insulin4all is needed as a rallying cry in the U.S., she says.

But supporters of the tests maintain that their approach is far more effective than focusing on arrests. Pill testing has been shown to change the black market for the better and may even decrease overall drug consumption, as negative results would deter a majority of people from consuming drugs and spur them to warn their friends, according to a summary of arguments in favor of tests by Australia's parliamentary library.

After a three-year legal battle, The Post obtained notes and transcripts, as well as several audio recordings, from more than 400 of the interviews. In stark language, the documents reveal that people who were directly involved in the war could not shake their doubts about the strategy and mission, even as Bush, Obama and, later, President Trump told the American people it was necessary to keep fighting.
What incentive does Brock Lesnar have not to cheat if he can have this one-off competition and walk off with [millions of dollars] if he know the precedent is to get fined a small fraction of that? Denning added. If the UFC wants to put its money where it's mouth is, this is really going to make it the world's best anti-doping program.
Trump, then, isn't what caused these conspiracy theories. He's what happens when nobody stands in their way.

Industry officials defended the new law as an effort to ensure that legitimate pain patients receive their medication without disruption. The industry had long complained that federal prescription drug laws were too vague about the responsibility of companies to report suspicious orders of narcotics. The industry also complained that the DEA communicated poorly with companies — citing a 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office — and was too punitive when narcotics were diverted out of the legal drug distribution chain.
Birkhead links his views on immigration to a larger philosophy of encouraging second chances for small-time offenders and concentrating on serious threats to public safety rather than marijuana misdemeanors, for example.

After the Sioux City event, I asked Warren if there was a reason she wasn't mentioning Medicare-for-all in the stump speech. No, no special reason, she said. No one's raised it. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid. Partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable. It's obviously about how we protect ourselves and each other. But it's also about our values. I hope we continue to have that conversation. I will continue to talk about health care every chance I get.

The first doses of vaccine mark only the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Ahead of us lie the nightmares of dealing with the issue that many high-risk factors overlap with social factors. Ethnic minorities and the poor are at greater risk both of catching the virus and of sustaining serious harm from it if they do. If governments around the world decide to give them priority (and both Kant and Mill might well agree that they should), will that decision be communicated clearly enough to gain acceptance among those who have to wait?
Even as millions of vaccines finally flow into hospitals and health departments, many Americans are confronting overwhelmed health systems.

The first time, you can say you didn't know, said Rannazzisi, now an expert witness for plaintiffs suing the drug companies. The second time, you can't say we didn't know. They knew. They knew what they were doing. How did they know? We told them. Everything we told them to do, they disregarded.
In the fall of 2012, the DEA embarked on its biggest diversion action to date, filing a civil case against Walgreens. The agency accused one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains of flooding Florida with painkillers. The case would ultimately result in an $80 million fine.

But they said the U.S. government failed to confront a more distressing reality — that it was responsible for fueling the corruption, by doling out vast sums of money with limited foresight or regard for the consequences.
Deeply involved in the effort to help the industry was the DEA's former associate chief counsel, D. Linden Barber. D. Linden BarberOnce a DEA lawyer who supervised cases against pharmaceutical companies, he left the agency and is now an executive at Cardinal Health.

Globally, more than two thirds of all MDMA consumers interviewed for the survey said they would likely have used drug testing facilities if they had been available.
In Buncombe County, the political mood was reinforced by the videotaped beating in 2017 of an African American jaywalker by Asheville city police. What I heard at the community level is people wanting leaders and law enforcement engaging honestly [and] coming up with concrete solutions around use-of-force issues, said the Rev.

Multiple TV journalists have flatly declared that Trump has revealed himself as a racist. It's good that it's now safe to say this on prime-time television, but we already knew that. What this episode also does is shatter the endless euphemisms and dissembling that Trump and his allies have employed to obscure a related truth: that the nationalism at the core of Trumpism is heavily driven by a reactionary backlash to the current ethnic and racial mix of the U.S. population — it is white nationalism, despite all the what-me-racist protestation to the contrary.

-- White House officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to Bloomberg News's Justin Sink and Jennifer Jacobs. Some advisers close to Trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. … But Trump's consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the White House see the gambit as the president's lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with Democrats fall flat.
When you get to the manufacturing level, it's hard to prove that they knew what was happening, another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. But they were making the product, they were selling it to the country's largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. These orders were beyond suspicious.
The documents make clear that the seeds of runaway corruption were planted at the outset of the war.

While the GOP was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the Democratic Party took much the opposite tack — mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. Although some research has found a recent uptick in Democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected Democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. They never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the Bush administration, for example. During the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Carol Moseley Braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. The left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet Democratic officials have battled that lie (which Trump himself has promoted).

The insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them.

Trump's cheery tone in an all-caps tweet welcoming the new year did not last the morning.
After the FDA's November announcement, Jack Henningfield, an addiction specialist who works at the drug policy consulting group Pinney Associates, said that surveys of kratom users suggest that many are taking the supplement to help stop using opioids. Henningfield, who has done work for the nonprofit American Kratom Association, argued late last year that the substance's overall abuse potential and risk of death isn't anything close to narcotics like opioids, and warned that restricting or banning it could drive some people onto the black market to buy it or push them back to opioids.

I am not sure that in the near future we will reach a level of population immunity where the virus will be virtually shut down, as we are accustomed to with measles. Through immunity due to vaccination, combined, unfortunately, with infections in the unvaccinated, we should reach a state where the risk of exposure is reduced due to a mostly immune population. While cases will still occur, our health system will no longer be stressed and large outbreaks should be less common.
Bush and Obama had polar-opposite plans to win the war. Both were destined to fail.

That would be compelling if not for two small details: Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Both entered their primaries as underdogs seen by the other party's front-runners as beatable. In Trump's case, Democrats were literally rooting for him to succeed; a memo published after the hack of Clinton campaign emails revealed that the Democratic front-runner wanted far-right candidates such as Trump to serve as Pied Pipers, serenading the rest of their party off a cliff.

This advice resonates with what I had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. And so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of Union Station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from Houston, Boston and Los Angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. Let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, Olowski says. That's not the Federalist Society's job. The Federalist Society's job is to put these ideas out there. And of course, as James Madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.

With it, she says, he initially had been paying about $200 to $300 a month out-of-pocket for his diabetic supplies and prescriptions, an amount he could just afford. The restaurant did not offer insurance, and his $35,000 salary put him above the income limit for Medicaid in Minnesota.

It's more like the approach Clinton's campaign took in 2016, and Sen. Cory Booker's pre-campaign is taking now, than what fans of Sanders found last cycle.

Crowley, who has since left Purdue, told The Post in an email that he and his colleagues did their best to cooperate with the DEA.
Most of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. What makes Leonard Leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says Steven Teles, author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law and a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. He has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.
In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said there's no question President Trump is a racist:
Nov. 18, 2018, issue: Huzzah, you've survived the midterm elections. But have you really? Because, certainly, you'll need to gather with extended family and friends to dissect the outcomes and, even better, to forecast the presidential race of 2020 — all while fighting off the indigestion that can accompany this catered panel discussion known as Thanksgiving dinner. Illustrator Franziska Barczyk reminds us of the internecine conflict to come. German-born and now living in Toronto, Barczyk has been to a Thanksgiving or two in the States and offers this advice: Smile, breathe, listen, don't cut people off. And then, of course, give thanks for civil discourse.
Instead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.

With a few words, the new law changed four decades of DEA practice. Previously, the DEA could freeze drug shipments that posed an imminent danger to the community, giving the agency broad authority. Now, the DEA must demonstrate that a company's actions represent a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat, a much higher bar.
A Cardinal spokeswoman said the company supported the legislation, which was passed unanimously in both chambers of Congress and signed into law by President Obama, because it brought greater clarity to the regulatory landscape.
Berthold said the evidence was so damning that few U.S. officials wanted to hear about it.

At the same hearing, a father from Maine told senators that a 90-day prescription for just one of his son's insulins would cost him $1,489.46. That's with his high-deductible insurance. He testified that he has taken to buying the same three-month supply from a Canadian pharmacy for about $300 plus $50 in shipping. (It's technically illegal to import medication from other countries, but the Food and Drug Administration generally doesn't prosecute individuals if it's a short-term supply for personal use.) He is not alone in his dilemma: The website GoFundMe has thousands of posts with people pleading for help to pay for insulin.
By keeping troops to a minimum in Afghanistan, the Bush administration was looking to claim swift victories on two fronts at the same time.
Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara, who (as noted above) was skeptical that Warren could win her state's primary, has warned that socialists can't depend on her to deliver systemic change. Sanders's politics grew out of the fading socialist movement; Warren's grew out of research into bankruptcy.
The tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.
In its absence, the hoarding and anti-social behavior witnessed last spring is now showing itself in hideously selfish antics over the vaccine. People are jumping queues and impersonating others, while interest groups are involved in an unsightly attempt to lobby Congress for their people to get the shot first.

Today, about 13,000 U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan. The U.S. military acknowledges the Taliban is stronger now than at any point since 2001. Yet there has been no comprehensive public reckoning for the strategic failures behind the longest war in American history.
When the DEA suspected that a company was ignoring suspicious sales, the agency filed an order to show cause. That gave a company at least 30 days to explain why the agency should not revoke its registration.

A lobbyist for the industry alliance emailed colleagues about working with the measure's sponsor.
It's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky argued in her 2015 book, Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Hollis-Brusky documented the impact of such a community: Focusing on key recent Supreme Court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with Federalist Society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.
The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do, President Trump said in August 2017 during a speech at Fort Myer, Va.
In the Lessons Learned interviews, however, other Bush administration officials said Rumsfeld was stingy and shortsighted. They said Washington would have saved money in the long run — and perhaps even subdued the Taliban — if it had built a bigger Afghan army and police force sooner.
Most art that appears in magazines is commissioned to illustrate a specific story.

Dena Sher, assistant legislative director for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said until this week the FEMA guidelines treated religious and nonreligious nonprofits equally, and determined eligibility based on what activities take place. Now this gives houses of worship special treatment, she said.
Trump's comments also reveal that this basic truth is shaping the White House's policy stances in the current immigration debate, something that is also being obscured with all sorts of rhetorical trickery. Trump's comments have upended the negotiations underway over a deal to protect the dreamers. But it can no longer be denied that Trump opposes the deal at least in part because it does not do enough to resist or roll back ongoing racial and demographic trends.
Jan. 4: In response to reports that Trump extended his deadline for pulling out from 30 days to four months, one of four senior administration officials speaking to reporters during a background briefing said, We have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from Syria.
They would have passed this with us or without us, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Our point was that this law was completely unnecessary.
The new strategy would require far more troops and far more aid for the Afghan government. A similar approach — dubbed the surge — had seemed to work in Iraq.
In the most egregious cases, the DEA employed an immediate suspension order, allowing the agency to lock up a distributor's drugs. The orders instantly halted all commerce in controlled substances on the grounds that the drugs constituted an imminent danger to the community.

In February 2008, the alliance said it planned to adopt best practice guidelines for its companies to follow, the unsealed documents from the Cleveland lawsuit show. The guidelines included establishing limits of pills or thresholds that customers such as pharmacies could order. The guidelines also included identifying orders of unusual size, frequency and pattern and stopping shipments that seemed suspicious, all of which are required by law and regulations.
A revised version of Colorado's vaccination plan no longer lists incarcerated people for priority vaccinations after an earlier plan, which put them ahead of the elderly and those with chronic conditions, sparked a political backlash, The Post's Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. Accusations that politicians were coddling convicted murderers while the law-abiding elderly went without vaccines caught fire on social media and made their way into newspaper editorials and on Fox News.

The DEA would ultimately bring at least 17 cases against 13 drug distributors and one manufacturer. The government said it assessed nearly $425 million in fines over a decade. Those fines reflect only a small portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue the companies receive each year.

— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.
Even when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. Whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's good, says Lew Olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. He was a human rights activist studying at Georgetown Law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the Federalist Society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. Now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. His ears prick up at isolated morsels of Hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … See what I mean? Olowski says. Music to my ears.
But he said he had escaped his upbringing in a fundamentalist, anti-government, anti-vaccination community that later was the subject of a documentary, and he welcomed the opportunity to show that the vaccinations are safe. The side effects were mild, he said.
It's more important to get people vaccinated than to perfectly march though each prioritized group, Azar said at a briefing on the vaccination effort.
For too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the Federalist Society, says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. When you actually look at the text and history of the entire Constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the Civil War, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the Federalist Society, would have you believe about our Constitution. The CAC has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. Its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The CAC also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of Congress who claim Trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.

Since the bill became law, the DEA has issued no immediate suspension orders against manufacturers and one against a distributor in May 2018. The Louisiana distributor, Morris & Dickson, denied the allegations, saying the DEA failed to show any evidence of an immediate threat of death, serious bodily harm or abuse — the new standard in the Marino bill that became law. Two weeks later, the Justice Department rescinded the order.

But with the exception of Beto O'Rourke, Democrats in swing races evaded the impeachment issue; they gave the sort of wait for Mueller' answers that Warren gave this weekend in Iowa. And the impeachment issue was more potentially potent in the midterms than it can possibly be in 2020. Either the House will impeach the president, or it won't; if it does, it will be as the first step in a process that Republicans get behind, in the sort of drama that is unthinkable right now. If it doesn't, the president will be on the ballot in 22 months, making the question completely irrelevant.
In the Lessons Learned interviews, U.S. officials aimed much of their criticism at the Afghan police, which function more as a paramilitary force than officers on the beat.
Since the DEA started to crack down on the opioid industry a decade ago, pharmaceutical companies and the law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 DEA officials — 32 of them directly from the division.

On Monday, groups representing state and local public health officials urged the administration to pass emergency funding to support front-line work, which includes 3,000 local health departments.
Between 2008 and 2011, the DEA had launched a half-dozen pain-clinic investigations involving drug distributors, including Cardinal for a second time, and one manufacturer, Mallinckrodt, the largest producer of generic opioids. The DEA hit them with inspection warrants, subpoenaed internal corporate records and issued orders to show cause as well as immediate suspension orders.
They weren't slinging crack on the corner, Rannazzisi said. These were professionals who were doing it. They were just drug dealers in lab coats.
Staffer contact with these organizations may skew their perceptions of the public because the groups are more ideologically conservative than the public along the range of issues we study, the researchers wrote.
In that litany, anti-corruption legislation is filed under government; voting rights, including a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to vote, is filed under politics. It's more incremental than the Sanders approach, but it grows out of a rationale for running, the sort of thing Democrats believe Hillary Clinton never was able to do. Warren, who has been accused of elitism (by Republicans) since entering politics, connects every policy position to her identity and the years she spent (to use a phrase she's dropped) on the ragged edge of the middle class.

The intellectual life of the American right since Sen.

Insurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.
Insulin, in its various manufactured forms, has been used to treat diabetes for almost a century, since Canadian researchers isolated the hormone in a lab in 1921. Before their discovery, what we now know as Type 1 diabetes was fatal. Even after being put on starvation diets, patients often lived no more than a few years. The researchers who transformed diabetes treatment won the Nobel Prize, and they sold their patent to the University of Toronto for a total of $3. Above all, these were discoverers who were trying to do a great humanitarian thing, and they hoped their discovery was a kind of gift to humanity, historian Michael Bliss told The Washington Post in 2016.

Part of the problem in the still-struggling United States is the tension between regulations intended to ensure a high-quality standard for tests and the need to roll out diagnostic capabilities very quickly. No test is perfect, and with high stakes for missing or misidentifying a case, public health officials want to make sure that tests are as accurate as possible and are validated by labs that run them. But the slowness may also reflect years of underinvestment in public health infrastructure — and a bias toward developing treatments that may seem more appealing to the public.
When Barber went to work for the drug industry in 2011, he brought an intimate knowledge of the DEA's strategy and how it could be attacked to protect the companies. He was one of dozens of DEA officials recruited by the drug industry during the past decade.
The next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with Federalist Society members: Twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges Trump has appointed are or were members of the society. Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, McGahn quipped to a Federalist Society gathering in 2017. That is completely false. I've been a member of the Federalist Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.
Prosecutors said that the Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz in the six weeks after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street.

Belatedly, U.S. military commanders started a campaign to root out corruption and clean up the Afghan government. The awakening frustrated many U.S. civilian officials who felt the uniformed brass had downplayed the problem since the start of the war.
Sept. 22, 2019, issue: Autumn is my favorite season — it's the best time to sit outside with my dog and a good book (or my sketchbook!). But my love of fall is tempered by how quickly it's overtaken by Christmas, with its egregious capitalism and oversaturation of absurdly tacky and invasive decorations. Aren't the beautiful fall leaves decorative enough?
Pifko then showed Kelly two talking points the organization had prepared for members of Congress to pose during the hearing. One of them was a defense of the drug industry: It seems to me at the end of the day that prescription drug abuse is caused by inappropriate prescribing and inappropriate dispensing, neither of which wholesalers are authorized or capable of regulating or enforcing.

-- Trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. Robert Costa, Felicia Sonmez and Nick Miroff report: Trump also said Sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. 'I can relate, and I'm sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,' Trump said. He claimed that 'many of those people agree with what I'm doing': refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. And he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say 'steel barrier.'

More than a year later, in October 2017, The Post and 60 Minutes published and broadcast a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the passage of the Marino bill. Several DEA officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had fought the bill for years but eventually yielded to industry pressure that had created a wave of support for it in Congress.
It's wild, said Mirya Holman, a political scientist at Tulane University who co-authored a 2015 report that found that 95 percent of sheriffs in the country were white. That figure, she argued, is no accident.
On July 7, 2009, members of a Tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of ­Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone. Task force agents alerted Mallinckrodt. The company's lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills.
The relationship here may have some element of causality. For instance, federal supply-side pressures may have kept heroin just valuable enough to entice cartels and suppliers to keep devising new ways to push the drug into U.S. markets, driving prices down. You get this filtering effect decade after decade where you end up artificially selecting or breeding super-traffickers, Sanho Tree, a drug policy expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, told Vox earlier this year.
At a rally for the Senate candidates last night in Dalton, Ga., Trump opened by declaring that there's no way he lost the state: The president also falsely said he had won reelection 'in a landslide' and suggested that he expects Vice President Pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over Wednesday's joint session … Trump has complained that he does not think he will get credit if [David] Perdue and Loeffler win but will be blamed if they lose … Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to lose Georgia in three decades. … 'Honestly, I think that he cannot handle being the sitting Republican president that lost Georgia,' said a GOP official in frequent touch with the White House. … Georgia's voting systems manager, Gabriel Sterling, refuted Trump's voter fraud claims point by point at a news conference Monday in Atlanta. 'This is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists,' Sterling said.
Today, critics argue that the price of insulin has far outpaced any innovations. In the past decade alone, U.S. insulin list prices have tripled, according to an analysis of data from IBM Watson Health. In 1996, when Eli Lilly debuted its Humalog brand of insulin, the list price of a 10-milliliter vial was $21. The price of the same vial is now $275. Those costs can be compounded by the multiple vials that diabetics may require to survive each month. It's a very big problem, says Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. It's a tragic barrier to care.
Kimberly Powers, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has also emphasized the imperative for Republicans to safeguard the sanctity of the electoral college in opposing Cruz and Co. Congress would imperil the Electoral College, which gives small states like Arkansas a voice in presidential elections, he said in a statement. Democrats could achieve their long-standing goal of eliminating the Electoral College in effect by refusing to count electoral votes in the future for a Republican president-elect.
The newly proposed language required the DEA to show that a company's conduct posed a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat of death, serious bodily harm or drug abuse before the agency could seek a suspension order.
A man was charged in the fatal shooting of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes. The killing of Jazmine last week in Houston set off a manhunt amid speculation that it was racially motivated. But authorities said they believe Barnes may have been shot at as a result of mistaken identity.

Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, said she escaped from her family because she feared for her life and is now demanding a meeting with the U.N.'s refugee agency. If deporting her would result in her death, we definitely wouldn't want to do that, the head of Thailand's immigration bureau said. (Shibani Mahtani) A Christian ministry in South Carolina is requesting an exemption from the Trump administration to continue imposing a Christians-only rule for its foster-care program.

The Los Angeles Chargers also beat the Baltimore Ravens in their wild-card matchup.
The Trump administration has several drug pricing efforts in the works, mostly centered on tweaking the way the government pays for drugs in the Medicare program. But it's been bold enough to have won some respect — if begrudging — from some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress, including Welch.
Great leaders know how to say hard things without wounding the innocent or stimulating dark hearts. Trump's instinct for the jugular may have served him well in the dealmaking meatgrinder of his native Queens, but most people in Main Street America prefer to get along and leave well enough alone. Trump has managed to make enemies of neighbors and divide families along partisan lines.
Trump made at least 29,508 verifiably false or misleading claims between taking office and Nov. 5. Glenn Kessler , our chief fact checker, said it's been difficult for his staff to keep up because Trump is peddling more falsehoods than ever.
What will the left do? There has been a clamor for Elizabeth Warren to run for president since the day she arrived in the Senate. Now that she's in, some of the first notes of skepticism came from people who had pined for her to do this four years ago. The reason: The left found a champion in 2016, and few people who consider themselves part of the left want to see Warren face off against Bernie Sanders.
The long definition stated that the objective for U.S. and NATO forces was to reduce the capability and will of the insurgency, support the growth in capacity and capability of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), and facilitate improvements in governance and socio-economic development, in order to provide a secure environment for sustainable stability that is observable to the population.
Warren's also the first 2020 contender with a serious army of political enemies, most of them on the right, who have spent much of the past decade trying to stop her rise. It's not easy to be Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has toiled to raise awareness of his presidential campaign since July 2017. But he's been able to do so without Republicans sending trackers, filing requests for public information and asking for ethics investigations. Warren's most controversial decision of 2018 — to take a DNA test and release the results — was spurred by six years of questions about why she once identified as Native American.
But with no sign of civil action by the DEA, the company said it believed that the ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit.

Two months after Obama signed the bill, Rosenberg testified on Capitol Hill.
— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.
He said it was understandable that Obama wanted to put the Afghan government on notice that the Americans wouldn't fight forever.
Matthew Murphy, formerly of the DEA, recalls a meeting with the president of a drug company who put his hands up and said,  'You got us. What can we do to make this right?'  Murphy said he had heard the same thing from drug dealers, but the heroin and cocaine traffickers didn't have a class ring on their finger from a prestigious university. (Katye Martens Brier/For The Washington Post)
It seems obvious that a deal can pass only with a lot of Democrats, so the trick for Democratic leaders will be to thread the needle by keeping just enough Dems on board to offset the conservatives who vote no.
But he welcomes liberals to the Federalist Society's jurisprudential worldview: There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. The fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.

The departures gave the industry an unfair advantage, Novak said.
Again the Obama administration backed down, and the U.S.-inspired anti-corruption drive lost even more steam.
One possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.
A pharmacist and a number of physicians told me about older insulins available from Walmart. The type of insulin first came out in the 1980s and now costs about $25 per vial. So-called Walmart insulin is a controversial solution for Type 1 diabetics, many of whom believe that older formulas are more likely to lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels. A few doctors echoed that concern. Yet it could still save lives. It's very good insulin, one physician told me. Another said, It's obviously better than nothing. Researchers have found that these older insulins work just as well for Type 2 diabetics as pricier analog insulins, but some research shows a slightly better outcome for Type 1 diabetics on newer formulas.
What are you doing [to] help well-intentioned registrants determine who they can do business with?
Terry McAuliffe. The former Virginia governor told CNN that he is obviously looking at a presidential bid, then distinguished his support for universal health care from the versions endorsed by liberal Democratic senators: We have to actually pay for what we're actually promising.
In a separate interview in 2015, another unnamed official complained that the Obama administration would not let U.S. troops attack Taliban camps on the Pakistani side of the border.
Because they were operating on a tight timetable, U.S. commanders first tried to clear areas where the Taliban was deeply entrenched, such as Helmand and Kandahar provinces in southern Afghanistan. The approach backfired when U.S. officials lavished aid on districts that remained supportive of the Taliban yet neglected peaceful areas that sided with the government in Kabul.
After all, we all want to know when we can go to concerts and ballgames again. Or even just go to the office. (Let's start small.)

A week later, Marino and Blackburn accused Rannazzisi of trying to intimidate the United States Congress and asked the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate.
In the film categories, big winners of the evening included the surprise choice of the Freddie Mercury biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (for best drama); 'Green Book' (best musical or comedy); lead acting (drama) awards for Rami Malek ('Bohemian Rhapsody') and an utterly surprised Glenn Close ('The Wife'); and 'Roma,' which won best foreign language film and best director (Alfonso Cuarón). In the television categories, Golden Globes went to FX's 'The Americans' (best drama, at long last); Netflix's 'The Kominsky Method' (best comedy, a very Golden Globes-kind of choice); and FX's 'The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story' (best limited series). Here is the full list of winners.
Some vaccine has been administered outside the bounds of intended policy. On Saturday, word got out that a health-care clinic in Austin was distributing vaccine and some people scrambled to get in line, according to the Austin American-Statesman.

Three days later, Mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by Barry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla. The company said that one of its distributors, Sunrise Wholesale of Broward County, Fla., had sent 20,400 tablets of oxycodone to Schultz in the previous year.
The shutdown has lasted 13 days without any signs of compromise or earnest negotiations, with Democrats largely unifying and a number of Republicans flummoxed over Trump's strategy.
In general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said.
Slaoui described two half-doses as a more responsible approach compared with stretching out the time between shots. Health officials in the United Kingdom have said that they are aiming to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine to as many people as possible, even if it means delaying the second shot in the two-dose regimen.
Other diplomats argued that trying to deal with the Taliban was a waste of time.
Sen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George's), the incoming chairman of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee who also served on the Kirwan Commission, said the panel recommended that $125 million in casino money be spent on its recommendations.
Some of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially Amy Coney Barrett, named by Trump to the 7th Circuit. More than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gaffe of telling the Catholic Barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. The lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of Barrett moderating the panel. Judge, welcome back to Washington — and I hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at Williams & Connolly, said to Barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.

After the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.

-- Trump's campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 Republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. … For Trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in Charlotte would be endless. They could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. The campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it's building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. The initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.
But a border wall is 'central to any strategy,' Vought wrote, and Democrats — who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government — remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. A Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.

-- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Parliament members to back her Brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. Politico's Laura Kayali reports: She refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. … 'Don't let the search for the perfect Brexit be the enemy of the good,' May said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line Brexiteers and EU supporters such as former European Commissioner Peter Mandelson, who argue the deal undermines British sovereignty and should be rejected. … May slammed MPs asking for a second referendum. 'It would divide our country and we wouldn't be able to organize a referendum before March 29 [when Brexit will take effect],' she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of Article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the EU).
Drug industry officials and experts blame the origins of the opioid crisis on the overprescribing of pain pills by doctors. The industry notes that the DEA approves the total amount of opioids produced each year.

I've made it clear on several occasions, and let me say it again: The Senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature. Let's not waste the time, McConnell said. Let's not get off on the wrong foot, with House Democrats using their new platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions.

The issue came to the fore again with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when religious organizations — not just houses of worship but major nonprofit agencies and institutions — suffered millions in property damage. The Bush administration said it would help rebuild parochial schools, nursing homes and similar religious institutions but would not pay for the rebuilding of houses of worship.
The new FDA analysis comes as the Drug Enforcement Administration considers whether to classify kratom as a controlled substance. In 2016, the DEA announced plans to place kratom temporarily in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, a category for drugs such as heroin. The move would have effectively banned its use. But officials backtracked after a public outcry and pressure from some members of Congress. In withdrawing its plan, the agency asked the FDA to speed up a scientific and medical evaluation on kratom.
At the time Alec discussed skipping insurance coverage, he told his mother, It can't be that bad. Within a month of going off her policy, he would be dead.

How the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.

Kareem Fahim reports: So in the seven weeks since [Saud al-Qahtani] was placed under investigation, only rumors have filled the silence. He was spotted recently in the coastal city of Jiddah, a resident said, and in the offices of the royal court here in the capital, according to a person who works with the government. Other accounts put Qahtani, once a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a remote corner of the kingdom, laying low. The government's treatment of Qahtani is being closely watched in Washington and other foreign capitals as a test of whether Saudi Arabia is sincere about prosecuting everyone found to be involved in Khashoggi's killing, including senior officials.

The DEA mobilized to defeat Marino's measure. One internal DEA memo obtained by The Post and 60 Minutes noted that the bill essentially eliminates the agency's power to file immediate suspension orders of drug shipments. The new law is fixing a problem that doesn't need fixing, a DEA official wrote.
Grassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).

The company declined to make Mason available for an interview for this article, but Nicole says he seemed compassionate. She held a photo of Alec during the meeting and placed it on the table in front of her while she read a statement. Profits should never come before the lives of people, she told Mason and the other representatives in the room, before asking them to remember her family's grief. She struggled to maintain her composure, she told me later, but when she brought up corporate greed with Mason, she says, I stopped and looked him dead in the face. He looked away.
Marino also issued a release taking credit for the legislation.

Holder's successor, Loretta E. Lynch, has never publicly explained why the Justice Department switched its position.
In particular, it is wrong to suggest Mallinckrodt was involved in any conspiracy related to Dr. Barry Schultz and Sunrise Wholesale, O'Connor said. In reality, Mallinckrodt worked with law enforcement to investigate potential diversion by the physician and to audit Sunrise, and, importantly, the DEA praised the company's handling of the investigation.
Polarization has also made mainstream American culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. Voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like Trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light. One recent Post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of Americans believed that CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of Russian election meddling in order to hide Ukraine's efforts to help Hillary Clinton.
Loretta E. Lynch, who was attorney general at the time, declined a recent interview request.
Andrews faced protests over conditions at the county jail, where nine inmates died since he took office in 2012. (All but one were African American.) Detractors also accused him of grandstanding after he tried to slap felony charges on 12 activists who toppled a Confederate statue in 2017, days after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.
His war strategy hinged on implementing a huge expansion of the Afghan security forces, from 200,000 soldiers and police to 350,000. The idea was for U.S. and NATO troops to train and advise the Afghans until they could take over the fight on their own.
A second order to show cause went to a McKesson facility in Landover, Md., in November 2007. That month, Cardinal had its license suspended at its center in Auburn, Wash. The DEA alleged the company had supplied 18 million doses of hydrocodone in nine months to retail pharmacies, including one filling illegitimate prescriptions.
Insurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.
Between April 2010 and February 2012, Walgreens's distribution center in Jupiter, Fla., sent 13.7 million oxycodone doses to six pharmacies in the state, a large and sudden increase.
By the time British Gen. David Richards took charge of NATO forces in Afghanistan in 2006, the Taliban was giving U.S. and allied troops all they could handle in the eastern and southern parts of the country.
I have a very distinctive beginning story, Randy Barnett told me over eggs at a diner in Logan Circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in November. There was no Federalist Society when I was a law student, so I didn't know anything about it. I heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and I'm a libertarian — I'm not a conservative.
One of the first-person essays on what it is actually like to blow the whistle on political sexual harassment.
But the tone soon turned testy.
We always said that these vaccines will be developed on the basis of science and all decisions will be made transparently on the basis of data, Slaoui said. Changing the decisions made … without any data I think would not be responsible.
Dostum fought alongside CIA operatives and U.S. Special Operations forces after 9/11. He was accused of war crimes after his militia suffocated hundreds of Taliban prisoners in November 2001 by locking them in airtight shipping containers.
Barber, now a senior vice president at Cardinal, did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. officials had gone to great lengths to help the Afghan government create a viable financial sector, and now it was at risk of complete failure. Moreover, much of the looted money had originated from the U.S. treasury, which subsidized the salaries of Afghan soldiers, police and civil servants who made up the bulk of Kabul Bank's depositors.

Rannazzisi was stunned. He had brought hundreds of these cases and had never been called to brief Cole, the ­second-most-powerful law enforcement official in the country.
U.S. officials constantly said they were making progress. They were not, and they knew it.
It's easy to see the line from older conspiracy theories to the fact-free claims by Trump supporters today. White House adviser Stephen Miller has drawn anti-immigration rhetoric from white-nationalist publications like the 1973 French novel The Camp of the Saints, which envisions hordes of immigrants obliterating Western civilization. Breitbart News has featured anti-immigrant, anti-gay and anti-black theories that could have been found in an earlier generation of far-right publications, including American Opinion and American Mercury.
The public health system is not sufficiently built to surge very rapidly, said Luciana Borio, the former director of Medical and Biodefense Preparedness Policy at the National Security Council and now a vice president at In-Q-Tel, a strategic investor that supports the U.S. intelligence community. Over the years, when given limited dollars, we applied it toward vaccines and therapeutics, more so than diagnostic tests. I think there's this idea: The diagnostic test is not going to save my life. But the fact is they underpin so much of the response and deserve a lot more attention.
The disconnect between what U.S. officials really thought about the Afghan security forces and what they said in public became ingrained during the early stages of the war.
With the absence of Akhundzada's iron hand, the province quickly became a magnet for insurgents, and its drug-trafficking problem exploded. Some U.S. officials came to regret his departure.
Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, which has performed a few hundred tests on behalf of more than a dozen countries, said that developing a test for a new pathogen is complicated and involves refinement and a back-and-forth between researchers who are constantly learning from one another.

The president's very first words of the new year were an endorsement of a pro-Trump book by former White House aide Sebastian Gorka. The former Breitbart writer, a frequent television defender of the president, quit or was fired in 2017 partly in protest that Trump's first major speech about the U.S. military strategy in Afghanistan made no mention of what he called Radical Islam.
Afghan security forces, despite years of training, were dogged by incompetence and corruption
Hogan said during a recent interview that he does not support an individual mandate for health insurance, an issue that he says needs to be addressed at the federal level.

With Rannazzisi under attack, the industry effort gained momentum. Marino Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) Donations received from industry, 2013 – June 2017: $92,500 President Trump's nominee to be drug czar sponsored the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. introduced yet another version of his bill in the House on Jan. 22, 2015. He announced that the Energy and Commerce Committee would hold a hearing five days later.
Neither the DEA nor the Justice Department informed OMB about the policy change in the bill, a former senior OMB official with knowledge of the issue said recently. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of internal White House deliberations.
For years, the United States and NATO could not find enough certified law enforcement professionals to train the Afghan police. To fill the gap, the Pentagon assigned regular troops to the job, even though they knew little about police work.

Ah, she could do without it.
Right now, vaccine distribution is progressing at an unacceptably slow speed, and at this current rate, it will take years to reach herd immunity — if ever. If we are able to pick up speed by many times in January, there is still a chance we could substantially slow down the infection and perhaps approach herd immunity in 2021.
Today, as the coronavirus situation underscores, too many of our supply chains for essential medicines and medical countermeasures are offshore.
A spokesperson for Blackburn, one of the authors of the bill, said at the time if there are any unintended consequences from this bipartisan legislation . . . they should be addressed immediately.
The inflation-adjusted price per pure gram of heroin fell nearly tenfold, from $3,260 in 1981 to $465 in 2012. The more the feds spent on supply reduction, in other words, the cheaper heroin got (federal data shows that the prices of other drugs, like cocaine and methamphetamines, fell similarly during this period). That's the exact opposite of what's supposed to happen, and of what Comey says will happen if we crack down on the heroin supply further.
NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:
This brings me to the question I'm often asked and that I sometimes ask myself: How could Republicans, Christians, evangelicals and other good people support someone such as Trump, especially as he threatened our democratic republic by denying the 2020 election results? What could Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) be thinking in joining his crusade to reverse the election's results — that is, other than their own 2024 presidential campaigns and their craven desire to appeal to Trump's loyal base?
Today, Rannazzisi is a consultant for a team of lawyers suing the opioid industry. Separately, 41 state attorneys general have banded together to investigate the industry. Hundreds of counties, cities and towns also are suing.
-- The Maryland General Assembly will convene Wednesday for a 90-day session. Ovetta Wiggins and Arelis R. Hernández report: Lawmakers are primed to take up many of the progressive issues they championed during their 2018 campaigns, with some Democrats and advocates pushing for a $15 minimum wage, an expansion of prekindergarten and an individual mandate for health insurance. Meanwhile, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose national profile has taken off since his decisive reelection, has pledged to continue to 'reach across the aisle' to lower student debt, attract and retain jobs, increase development in urban areas, improve education and reduce crime.
March 14, 2021, issue: Over the past few years, the celebration of pi, a mathematical constant comprising trillions of digits that begins with 3.14, has gained in popularity — probably because it's a great excuse to bake, eat or gift some pie on March 14. Grab your forks and strap in.
On a conference call last Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his caucus that, in his 36 Senate years, he has twice cast votes to take the nation to war and once to remove a president, but that the vote he will cast this Wednesday to certify [Biden's victory] will be the most important of his career, legendary conservative columnist George Will reports. The day before McConnell's somber statement, Missouri's freshman Republican senator, Josh Hawley, announced that on Wednesday, 14 days before Biden will be inaugurated, he will challenge the validity of Biden's election. Hawley's conscience regarding electoral proprieties compels him to stroke this erogenous zone of the GOP's 2024 presidential nominating electorate. …
After 5 1/2 years, I will hand over the reins of The Daily 202 later this month to Olivier Knox, a veteran political reporter and broadcast journalist, to start my next job as a columnist for the Opinions section. Knox has covered every presidential campaign and administration in the last 20 years. He joins The Post from SiriusXM, where he was chief Washington correspondent and hosted a live, three-hour show each weeknight focused on politics, foreign policy, and the federal government. Before that, he reported for Yahoo News and hosted a weekly Yahoo-branded radio show. Knox got his start as a reporter at Agence France-Presse, for which he covered eight years of the George W. Bush administration. He served as president of the White House Correspondents' Association from July 2018 to July 2019.
Oct. 7, 2018, issue: This issue marks a new beginning for The Washington Post Magazine: new features, new layouts, new fonts. But new beginnings can conjure many things, and for artist Lydia Ortiz — whose work appears above — it's insects. I've always been so fascinated by rebirths, Ortiz says. I love the image of an entity laying dormant for a while as it re-creates itself. The metamorphosis of a butterfly is a fantastic example of a physical renewal.

Oct. 20, 2019, issue: One of the worst effects of gentrification is the displacement of a community with deep ties to a certain area or neighborhood. Often this displacement is made more painful by the incoming residents' lack of knowledge about the culture and history of a place: One can't 'discover' something that was already there. The character of a neighborhood suffers — until it looks, feels, smells and sounds homogeneous.
There are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.
But that same year, a DEA investigator in New York, Heather White, told ­Mallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about know your customer's customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement, according to the prosecutor's summary.

It would confound reason if the presidential results of these states were to face objection while the congressional results of the same process escaped public scrutiny, Roy said. Those representatives were elected through the very same systems – with the same ballot procedures, with the same signature validations, with the same broadly applied decisions of executive and judicial branch officials – as were the electors chosen for the president of the United States under the laws of those states.
The last time the two spoke was in December, when Trump signed the provisions for coal miners into law as part of a bigger legislative package. But Manchin met at the White House this month ahead of the Senate trial with senior aides, including legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, who is taking a central role in the impeachment fight. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Lee kept trying to shut us down, said Novak, now in private practice. He kept telling us about the Walgreens case and the imminent danger standard and that we were going to lose all of our cases and we didn't have enough information to go forward.
He said the president of one of the drug companies sat on the other side of the table, put his hands up and said,  'You got us. What can we do to make this right?'  Murphy recalled.
Barnett and Cooper declined to comment. (Their firm, Williams & Connolly, does legal work for The Post.)
That's still a substantial bloc of voters, and in interviews with Iowa Democrats last month, The Post found plenty of them worrying that a divisive candidate could not win the presidency. The forces that ended up giving the Republican nomination to Trump do not exist on the left. What is motivating Democratic voters? Thanks to Warren, we'll find out pretty soon.
Federal appeals court appointments President Trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.
The meaning of this is plain. Trump has claimed he objects to the lottery program because it admits terrorists, but he still objects to the deal reached on it because it still allows people (those with TPS) from the wrong countries, the shithole countries, to remain. He wants more funding for the wall, which is symbolic, yes, but that's exactly the point: As Frank Sharry of America's Voice puts it to me, the wall is a middle finger to Latin America, a statement that we don't want your kind. It's a middle finger to shithole countries, but more to the point, it's a statement that we don't want the people from them.
The DEA cited the industry alliance's own compliance guidelines issued four years earlier as evidence that Walgreens knew or should have known that it was required to report suspicious orders and ignored them.
Feb. 3, 2019, issue: Spring is still weeks away, but artist Chloe Scheffe likes how it remains a state of mind for some. Recently I saw a man carrying flowers in this very way, she recalls. The image stayed with me, I think, because it spoke so clearly of his other life — the life we all have, outside of work or school. She adds, One of my favorite things about East Coast winters is that bodegas still sell fresh flowers outside. I can walk my neighborhood in the dead of winter, during a snowfall, and see flowers in bloom.
At first, hopes were high that Obama's strategy would turn the tide. But military and civilian officials interviewed for the SIGAR project said it soon became clear that lessons learned from one war zone did not necessarily apply to the other.
The bill would create a high standard for the DEA to meet in order to immediately suspend a drug company's operations, former DEA officials told The Post. Previously, the DEA had to show only that a company's actions were posing an imminent danger to public health or safety. The new bill defined imminent danger to mean that a company was creating a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm.
There's no way that we could meet that burden, the determination that those drugs are going to be an immediate threat, because immediate, by definition, means right now, Rannazzisi said.

Akhundzada, who went on to become a provincial senator, was unapologetic about his ruthless tactics. In a 2009 interview with the British news outlet the Telegraph, he said that after he was fired as governor, 3,000 of his followers switched sides and joined the Taliban because they had lost respect for the government.

Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts said in a statement that the company's vaccine appears to confer some protection as early as 12 days after the first dose, but that there isn't data on whether protection is sustained beyond three weeks with a single dose.
-- Small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. Heather May, Annie Gowen and Joel Achenbach report: Many of the affected federal workers — including 10,000 people in Utah, 6,200 in West Virginia and 5,500 in Alabama — have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. But those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them — eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores — creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.
The panel estimates the cost of those programs at $3.8 billion annually for the next 10 years. The battle over how the state and local governments will pay that tab is not expected until next year.
You can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option, Dayen wrote. The impulse is the same: The game is rigged and must be fixed. But there's a long gap between re-writing the rules of the game, as Warren wants, and turning over all the chess pieces, as Sanders does.
I never said we're doing it that quickly, but we're decimating ISIS, Trump told reporters Sunday morning as he headed for Camp David. With that being said, we're pulling out of Syria. But … we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.
Comments from the most politically vulnerable members of McConnell's caucus suggested discomfort with the majority leader's approach, and a desire for a quick resolution to the shutdown.
This has implications for our philosophical strategies. If vaccinating medical workers and potential super-spreaders first might not help reduce the spread, then there is no choice but to give the vaccine to the oldest first. (Sorry, utilitarians.)
Dec. 24: Trump declared that Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. The Saudis responded that they had not made any financial pledges since August, when the State Department announced that Riyadh had committed $100 million to a stabilization fund.
One distributor that caught the attention of the DEA for sending drugs to Florida was KeySource Medical, a regional company based in Cincinnati. In 2010, it sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida, documents show. That was nearly 2.5 pills for every man, woman and child in the state.
The request comes after federal agencies quickly burned through a $100 million fund and worked to transfer an additional $136 million from other accounts. Overall, the administration said in its request Monday that it intends to spend at least $2.5 billion to respond to the coronavirus, counting existing funds and transfers from other accounts.
So do I support, in order to have something like Medicare-for-all, that we ask folks that are in the top 0.05 percent or 0.5 percent or top 1 percent to pay more? he asked rhetorically.

Immigrant leaders say it is a relief to have a sheriff who will not voluntarily cooperate with ICE. Some undocumented immigrants have faced deportation after minor traffic violations, when the officers ticketing them discovered they were driving illegally. North Carolina does not issue licenses to residents without Social Security numbers.
That question is difficult to answer, as there is considerable uncertainty around the level of immunity we would need in the population to achieve herd immunity, along with the speed with which we can expect widespread vaccine uptake to occur.
After months of debate at the White House, Obama approved the counterinsurgency strategy.
The Justice Department, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment. The DEA also declined to comment.
These questions raise two severe problems, one ethical and one scientific. The ethical problem is that they lead to very different programs of vaccine distribution.
The U.S. flooded the country with money — then turned a blind eye to the graft it fueled
Using that model, FDA scientists analyzed the 25 most common compounds in kratom and concluded that all of them share the most structural similarities with opioid painkillers such as morphine derivatives. The model also showed that 22 of the compounds bind strongly to opioid receptors in the brain and to receptors that may contribute to stress responses that impact neurological and cardiovascular function.
DEA officials realized they needed a new strategy to confront this new kind of drug dealer.
In January 2010, Afghan anti-corruption agents trained by the United States raided the headquarters of the New Ansari Money Exchange, one of the country's largest financial institutions, and carted away tens of thousands of documents.
Thanks to years of GOP tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. One poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. Some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. Trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.

That representational bias may partly explain why Congress has often been willing to advance pro-business legislation even in the face of strong opposition from the public.
The DEA accused KeySource in June 2011 of trying to conceal the amounts of drugs it was shipping by splitting its orders and told the company to halt its oxycodone shipments.
There would be plenty of time for more activism, but today was meant for those who knew Alec best. At dusk, Brittany handed out sparklers and Roman candles, and the crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. They launched the fireworks into big bursts of yellow and green, with sparks and ash raining down over the yard. It had been a hard day, but it was still a party. Nicole stood on the deck to record the scene on a cellphone as friends and family called out: Happy birthday, Alec! We love you! We miss you. Everyone stared up at the sky, watching until the last flare burned out.
In Oct. 22, 2012, the DEA served Mallinckrodt with another subpoena for records relating to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, the company disclosed in SEC filings.

Other new sheriffs were doing much the same. In Mecklenburg and Wake counties, North Carolina's largest jurisdictions, they notified ICE that their offices would no longer participate in the federal program that delegates immigration enforcement to local agencies.
Even if the legislation doesn't have the border money Trump wants, Gardner said, We can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open and let Democrats explain why they no longer support border security.
A veto threat issued by the White House against the House bills read: The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies, but cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.
Barnett realized he had misread the Federalist Society. Despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. He switched from contracts to constitutional law. He made himself an expert on the Ninth Amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in California, where the state had legalized it. The case ended up relying not on the Ninth Amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite Federalist tool for curbing federal power. Barnett argued the matter before the Supreme Court in 2004. He lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.
A spokesman for Gov. Jared Polis declined to make the governor available for an interview but issued a statement defending the state's plan, stressing the moral obligation to prioritize elderly people most at risk of dying from the virus and front-line health-care heroes caring for the sick.
The senior DEA official said the agency worked with Congress to improve the bill under difficult political circumstances. The agency believed earlier versions of the bill would have forced it to meet a criminal standard before issuing immediate suspension orders. The original version of the bill was unworkable, the official said.

The delays cost months, sometimes years.
-- The Trump administration and Democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall — signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report: As agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. The administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an Obama-era program that allowed children in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the United States ...
In the meantime, a portion of the more than 7 million diabetic Americans who take insulin are stuck with debilitating costs. Though most don't pay the full list price for insulin because of insurance coverage and other rebates, some do, especially those who are uninsured, underinsured or facing a coverage gap through Medicare. The most vulnerable patients are subsidizing the system, William Cefalu, the chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the American Diabetes Association, told a Senate committee in May.

Because a public health emergency has been declared, certified hospital laboratories that usually have the ability to internally develop and validate their own tests can't use them without applying for an emergency use authorization, a major barrier to deploying the test.

The DEA and Justice Department have denied or delayed more than a dozen requests filed by The Post and 60 Minutes under the Freedom of Information Act for public records that might shed additional light on the matter. Some of those requests have been pending for nearly 18 months. The Post is now suing the Justice Department in federal court for some of those records.
In August 2009, Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan at the time, warned: Malign actions of power brokers, widespread corruption and abuse of power . . . have given Afghans little reason to support their government.
-- Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book took home surprise honors at a Golden Globes ceremony marked by a Hollywood consensus on the need for industry change, television critic Hank Stuever reports. The stars are bored. It's their own fault, really, and it's mostly a good thing: They're woke and on board with Hollywood's attempts at a corrective course on diversity and equal rights, which is why Sunday night's telecast of the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards on NBC lacked the boozy, loosey-goosey tension of its renowned past. But is that really such a sacrifice, in exchange for solidarity? This was a by-the-book but overlong awards show, gentle on the jokes and heavy on the adulation.
But the Lessons Learned reports omitted the names of the vast majority of those interviewed for the project, as well as their most biting critiques. The Post obtained notes and transcripts of the interviews under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) after a three-year legal battle.
Speaking to the troops, Trump criticized their commanders for failing to meet the previous deadlines he set. We're no longer the suckers, folks, the president said.

A second unnamed Treasury Department official told government interviewers that soon after he arrived in Afghanistan in the summer of 2010, he met with an American who had been working on contract as a consultant to Afghanistan's central bank for at least three years. The U.S. official wanted to know more about Kabul Bank, which unknown to both of them was on the verge of failure.

Another revenue generator that some lawmakers are eyeing: legalizing recreational marijuana for adults. But, similar to sports betting, Miller said legalizing marijuana would be a ballot initiative and would be taken up the year it would go on the ballot.
-- All these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. Trump's words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. President Barack Obama also learned this the hard way when he said Assad using chemical weapons would be a red line and then didn't forcefully respond when he did.
The industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S.

New York activist Siela Bynoe is considering a challenge to Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), one of Pelosi's most persistent critics, and her supporters are circulating a poll that suggested the Pelosi issue could make Rice vulnerable.

Prosecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. Under pressure from the DEA, Sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office had arrested Schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. Schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Dec. 26: Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his flight to Iraq that he would reject any request from generals to again extend his deadline for pulling out. They said again, recently, 'Can we have more time?' Trump said of U.S. generals. I said: 'Nope! You can't have any more time! You've had enough time!' We've knocked them out.
When you're selling half a million pills to some pharmacy and you're telling me that you don't know what the rules are for a suspicious order? said Geldhof, who is now working as a consultant to lawyers suing the industry. All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing, and there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time. It was about money, and it's as simple as that.

Barber declined repeated requests for an interview.
Indeed, Trump had declared extemporaneously in March during a speech in Ohio: We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now! Then he backed off in the face of resistance from aides and the brass — just like he might be doing again.
Senior White House officials, alarmed by gaps in the U.S. supply chain for responding to the coronavirus, have also begun studying potential measures to improve the United States' capacity for producing drugs and necessary medical equipment. This month, as the outbreak accelerated, a team of White House officials traveled to the Virginia Biotechnology Research Park in Richmond for a tour of a facility piloting the production of generic pharmaceuticals.
Sweeping these problems under the rug undermines public trust in our institutions of government, Amelia Chassé said.
Social media posts from the New Year's Eve event show a crowd of maskless revelers, including Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., dancing and listening to bands in the Donald J.

The top federal prosecutor in Atlanta left his position on Monday without warning. In the call with Raffensperger, Trump referred to him angrily as the Never Trumper U.S. attorney in Atlanta as he complained that criminal charges were not being pursued over what the president claims, without evidence, is voter fraud. Byung J. 'BJay' Pak, who was appointed by Trump, announced his resignation as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia in a news release. The statement did not say why Pak was leaving or what he plans to do next, the AP reports. Pak was a Republican state lawmaker from 2011 to 2017, had previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney from 2002 to 2008 and was working in private practice at the time of his appointment. … A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond Monday to questions about what sparked Pak's sudden resignation or whether acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen had sought the departure. Pak's resignation comes nearly a month after the departure of Charlie Peeler, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 to serve as U.S. attorney for the Macon-based Middle District of Georgia. Peeler resigned on Dec. 11.

Peter, among others, saw Bush v. Gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, Caroline Fredrickson, president of the ACS, told me.

Some faith groups praised the Bush administration for recognizing the public service faith groups provide and simply not discriminating, while separationist groups said institutions like religious schools were primarily serving a religious purpose and shouldn't get government funds.
But six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against Mallinckrodt. Instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Under the proposal, which remains confidential, Mallinckrodt would agree to pay a $35 million fine and admit no wrongdoing.

Mallinckrodt did knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with Sunrise and Barry Schultz to commit offenses against the United States, prosecutors wrote in a draft complaint against the company that was never filed. That is, to knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully distribute, dispense or prescribe controlled substances, including but not limited to the Schedule II drug oxycodone 30 mg.

-- Trump's press secretary left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency in a Fox News interview. From Politico's Victoria Guida: [Sarah] Sanders said Trump 'is prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country.' 'We're looking at exploring every option available that the president has,' she said. 'Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful.' She also argued that the president isn't 'holding anybody hostage' by not signing legislation that would fund government agencies other than the Department of Homeland Security. 'He knows it's better if they can focus on getting all these packages done at once,' Sanders said.
The request reflects the fast-evolving nature of the crisis confronting the administration, which until recently had insisted that no additional funds were necessary.

The U.S. Postal Service has been under siege for months as record volumes of holiday packages and election mail ran up against a spike in coronavirus cases within its workforce, leaving the agency severely short-staffed. Nearly 19,000 workers were in quarantine at the end of 2020 after becoming infected or exposed to the virus, Jacob Bogage reports. That has left hundreds of small publishers struggling to deliver their products, according to the National Newspaper Association, undercutting their advertising revenues and subscriber bases, and depriving the largely rural communities they serve of crucial news coverage. Some news operations have even called on reporters and editors to deliver papers. They're also staring down rate increases of as much as 9 percent in 2022 and for years thereafter. Mail service is already one of their biggest costs, industry insiders say, and such a scenario could force hundreds of small publications out of business given their already bite-size margins.
Two months later, on Feb. 18, 2014, Marino and Blackburn introduced legislation on Capitol Hill that would redefine the law regulating suspicious orders filled by drug companies.
What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics — the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems, Obama said in the first speech of his 2008 campaign.
One month later, Rumsfeld sent another confidential memo to national security adviser Stephen Hadley, complaining about a tangled arrangement between the Pentagon and the State Department to train Afghan police that was going nowhere.
The reaction from United Nations human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville, was uncharacteristically blunt. He described the remarks as racist. … In El Salvador, the news of the comments quickly shot to the top of media websites. … In Haiti, people took to Twitter to share pictures of their country — verdant green hills, palm trees in the sunset, and sparkling turquoise water. … In Africa, similar reactions celebrating the beauty of the continent's countries.

The U.S. government's top infectious-disease doctor, a leading drug regulator and the Health and Human Services secretary are dismissing suggestions that the second shot of authorized coronavirus vaccines could be delayed to make more doses available faster to more people, Carolyn Johnson reports. In recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges. The debate is playing out as the United States struggles with administering the doses it already has. More than 15 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data updated Monday morning, but only about 4.5 million have been administered. … Last week, the United Kingdom made the controversial decision to prioritize giving a first dose of its authorized vaccines — even if it meant there wasn't enough to give people a booster shot within the recommended three to four weeks. U.K. authorities have said people could wait as long as 12 weeks. Limited data suggests a single shot affords some protection against disease, but it is not known how complete or long the protection lasts.
With no vaccines likely to be ready in the next several months, it will be up to public health agencies to identify, quarantine and monitor people at high and medium risk for developing covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus; isolate and test those with symptoms; and quickly identify potential cases.

Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, ran as an implacable opponent of the president who had once been hauled out of an event for protesting him. Her district, which for a half-century was represented by John Conyers, gave Trump just 18.1 percent of the vote. For Tlaib herself, the political impact of saying that she wants the president impeached and removed from office was at worst a wash; at best, it's going to earn her votes.
At first, the conversation was cordial. Rannazzisi and DEA officials discussed the legislation with staffers from the Judiciary and the Energy and Commerce committees.
In a 2015 Lessons Learned interview, Michael Callen, an economist who specializes in the Afghan public sector, recalled working with a newly arrived U.S. colonel who wanted to set up a secure system that would pay Afghan police officers by mobile-phone transfers instead of cash.

Marino declined repeated requests for comment. Marino's staff called the U.S. Capitol Police when The Post and 60 Minutes tried to interview the congressman at his office on Sept. 12. In the past, the congressman has said the DEA was too aggressive and needed to work more collaboratively with drug companies.
Ocasio-Cortez also defended past false statements:
But how will any of this cost them votes? The Tlaib controversy is what I like to call a Red Hen event — a brief source of outrage that is pored over for political impact but it too far from an election to have any. Think of the moments in 2017 and 2018 that were, according to Republicans (and some neutral analysts), going to focus the electorate on the new radicalism of the Democratic Party.
Today, to prevent skimming, most of the security forces receive their pay by electronic bank account transfers, but graft persists.
Since 2002, the United States has allocated more than $83 billion in security assistance to Afghanistan, a sum that dwarfs the defense budgets of other developing nations. In 2011, at the peak of the war, Afghanistan received $11 billion in security aid from Washington — $3 billion more than what neighboring Pakistan, which has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and a far bigger army, spent that year on its military.

I think I know the answer: A certain percentage of conservatives think Trump saved the country simply by deregulating industry and keeping his promise to appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court. Full stop. He was their bulwark against decline and fall. They believe in his unsubstantiated claims that the election was rigged for the same reasons. It is all in the service of a higher calling: free markets, freedom of conscience, and a pro-life position that can't be compromised as a matter of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

In a letter to Trump, the groups said that while it is too early to reliably predict the additional costs and needs of a covid-19 response, the administration should act quickly so that sufficient funds could be appropriated to stay ahead of the curve and perhaps pursue a strategy to enact multiple appropriations on an as-needed basis as the situation unfolds.
About halfway into the 18-year war, Afghans stopped hiding how corrupt their country had become.
Within the DEA and the Justice Department, Marino's overtures to Holder set off alarms. On May 7, 2014, Matthew Strait, the DEA's congressional liaison officer, detailed ways to push back on Marino's bill, according to an email he wrote.
The case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product.

To reach herd immunity with the coronavirus, approximately 230 million Americans would need the vaccine. As of yesterday, just 4 million had gotten the first of two shots. Daily immunizations have increased considerably over the past few days, with about 500,000 people getting the shot each day, but experts say that number needs to at least double and ideally quadruple.
While we appreciate the many efforts underway at CDC to provide a diagnostic assay to our member labs … this has proven challenging and we find ourselves in a situation that requires a quicker local response, said the letter, which was co-signed by Becker. We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories.
Rice's 4th District is not quite as blue as the typical Democratic primary battlefield. Republican candidates for president regularly win around 44 percent of its vote, more than double their support in Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 14th District. But Sean McElwee of Data for Progress is conducting polls in 10 districts, a mixture of places where moderate incumbent Democrats represent much more liberal electorates and places where certain votes or issues could create an opening for a challenger.

Judges on the appellate panel voiced similar concerns during oral arguments.
It's not that the Afghans aren't good at fighting. They are, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said during a visit to Kandahar in February 2015. But just a few years ago there really was no Afghan national security force at all.

One program broadly falls in line with a school of thinking that goes back at least as far as the 18th century Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and holds that we should always treat people as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. In common parlance, this is similar to the biblical Golden Rule — do unto others what we would want done to ourselves. Under this approach, we should first vaccinate those who are most at risk from the virus. This means giving priority to the elderly and those in care homes, and then steadily spreading vaccinations to younger age groups. This is happening in the U.K. and Germany.
Initial results showed Karzai, the incumbent, had won. But his opponents, and many independent observers, accused his side of trying to steal the election. A U.N.-backed panel investigated and determined Karzai had received about 1 million illegal votes, a quarter of all those cast.
-- Trump tweeted that the al-Qaeda operative accused of organizing the 2000 bombing on the USS Cole, Jamal al-Badawi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike. Felicia Sonmez reports: U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, confirmed Badawi's death Sunday afternoon. … Seventeen American sailors were killed and more than 40 were injured in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack, in which al-Qaeda suicide bombers pulled up to the refueling destroyer in an explosives-laden boat and blasted a hole in its hull.
When the two men had lunch just after the 2018 midterm election at the White House, Trump turned to Ivanka Trump and Vice President Pence, smiled and said: I told you we couldn't beat him.

Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, persuaded six of the most committed conservatives in the House to sign onto a statement he drafted Sunday that makes a blunt case for counting all the electors submitted by the states. The centerpiece of his argument is that failing to do so will create dangerous precedents and open a Pandora's box that would eventually doom the electoral college.
A spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.

But beyond the law-enforcement issues, the sheriff races signal North Carolina's changing demographics. The state has long been purple politically; the governor is a Democrat, but Republicans control the legislature. Assessing the recent electoral outcomes — with the defeat of three Republicans, all seven urban sheriffs are now Democrats — Duke University political scientist Kerry Haynie sees a blue tint in the future.
Manhattan's district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has signaled that his 16-count indictment is intended to ensure Manafort is held accountable for his crimes regardless of the presidential pardon he received late last month, Shayna Jacobs reports. Vance brought his case against Manafort in March 2019. New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley dismissed it later that year, saying the charges too closely overlapped with the federal conviction. The dismissal was upheld in October by a state appeals court, a decision Vance now hopes the New York Court of Appeals will agree to review. Manafort's lawyer, Todd Blanche, wrote in Monday's letter to New York's top judge that the state court charges dismissed more than a year ago 'allege the exact same fraud, causing the exact same harm.'
On July 29, the Marino bill passed the House and went to the Senate.

The federal law behind these various FEMA policies is called the Stafford Act of 1988. Diament said it is silent about the issue of religion altogether. It includes a section about private nonprofits that can get post-disaster funds. It has a list that isn't comprehensive, but more illustrative, Diament said — it just lists the type of groups, and includes community centers, museums and art centers.
While the idea has recently gained more support, drug tests aren't new and have also been tried in some parts of the United States. Installing such facilities at music festivals has de facto been the norm in some European countries, including the Netherlands and Austria, for more than a decade. But amid more detailed research and increases in drug-related hospital admissions, supporters of drug tests are now also gaining momentum in Australia and New Zealand, where authorities have so far allowed only limited trials.

-- One Facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated Baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported Republican Roy Moore's candidacy. The New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder report: The 'Dry Alabama' Facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: Alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. Along with a companion Twitter feed, the Facebook page appeared to be the work of Baptist teetotalers who supported [Moore]. 'Pray for Roy Moore,' one tweet exhorted. In fact, the Dry Alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive Democrats who were out to defeat Mr. Moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.
The companies were feeling the pressure. Crowley, Purdue's compliance director, wrote to a colleague on March 19, 2008, about DEA's latest plans to squeeze the wholesalers and distributors on 'pain clinics,'  according to an email unsealed in the case. Crowley predicted that the DEA will call distributors into Headquarters and read them the riot act, etc.
And I am especially proud of this fact: that African-American fourth graders in the state of Texas have better math skills than any other students--African-American students in any state in the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) And we can make this progress at the national level. A central part of my agenda, for example, is to challenge and change Title 1, to make sure we close the achievement gap, to make sure that children are not forgotten and simply shuffled through the system. Under my vision, all students must be measured. We must test to know. And low-performing schools, those schools that won't teach and won't change, will have three years to produce results, three years to meet standards, three years to make sure the very faces of our future are not mired in mediocrity. And if they're able to do so, the resources must go to the parents so that parents can make a different choice. You see, no child--no child should be left behind in America. (APPLAUSE) See every child can learn. Every child can learn. And every child in this country deserves to grow in knowledge and character and ideals. Nothing in my view is more important to our prosperity and goodness than cultivated minds and courageous hearts. As W.E.B. Du Bois said a century ago, Either the United States will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States. Education is the essential beginning, but we've got to go further.

The CDC announced a week and a half ago that it would add pilot coronavirus testing to its flu surveillance network in five cities, a step toward expanded testing of people with respiratory symptoms who didn't have other obvious risk factors. Specimens that test negative for flu will be tested for coronavirus. But that expanded testing has been delayed because of an unspecified problem with one of the compounds used in the CDC test. About half of state labs got inconclusive results when using the compound, so the CDC said it would make a new version and redistribute it.

The administration is looking at potential unilateral actions to strengthen Buy American provisions that would require federal agencies such as Health and Human Services, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to buy drugs and other medical equipment from facilities in the United States. White House officials are also interested in speeding up the production of advanced pharmaceuticals, although exactly how they would do so is not clear.

McKesson and AmerisourceBergen were two of the Big Three — along with Cardinal Health — which distributed nearly 85 percent of the nation's legal drugs.

Some U.S. officials were furious and said it was time for a reckoning, while others argued it was more important to mollify Karzai and retain his support for the war. Complicating matters further was a New York Times report that Karzai's aide had been on the CIA's payroll for years.

The effort was led by Joe Rannazzisi, a hard-charging DEA agent from New York who worked the streets of Detroit before being promoted to lead the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, a small unit that was seen at the time as something of a backwater in an agency devoted to pursuing high-profile heroin, cocaine and marijuana cases.

In this vein, Roy did something else clever on Sunday evening as the new Congress was sworn in. To make a point, he objected to the swearing-in of all members from the six states where Trump falsely claims the vote was rigged. This forced the House to vote on whether the lawmakers who were on the same ballot with the president – and won their races – should be allowed to take the oath. Naturally, Republicans wanted to seat their members from Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The vote was 371 to 2 to say that all of their elections were legitimate.

So while some in my party have avoided the NAACP, and while some in the NAACP have avoided my party... (LAUGHTER) ... I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to be here. (APPLAUSE) I'm here--I'm here because I believe there's so much that we can do together to advance racial harmony and economic opportunity. Before we go to the future, we must acknowledge our past. In the darkest days of the Civil War, President Lincoln pleaded to our divided nation to remember that we cannot escape history, that we will be remembered in spite of ourselves. One hundred and forty years later, that's still true. For our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress, still exists today. For my party, there is no escaping the reality that the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln. Recognizing and confronting our history is important. Transcending our history is essential. We're not limited by what we have done or what we have left undone. We're limited only by what we're willing to do. (APPLAUSE) Our nation must make new a commitment to equality and upward mobility to all of the citizens. This is a great moment of national prosperity, but many still live in prosperity's shadow. The same economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as well. From the beginning of this campaign, I have said that prosperity must have a purpose.
The national police number about 91,000. They report to the Interior Ministry and are more of a paramilitary force than a crime-fighting agency. The police guard the border, staff security checkpoints and try to hold territory that the army has cleared of insurgents.

Key insiders speak bluntly about the failures of the longest conflict in U.S. history
Consider the particulars of the current immigration talks and Trump's response to them. In the White House, a bipartisan group of senators yesterday presented an agreement that would grant protected status to the dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, pump more money into border security, tweak family-based immigration and end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which distributes visas to countries with historically low immigration rates, many in Africa and Central Asia, channeling those visas to some U.S. residents with temporary protected status (TPS) from countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti, a program Trump is rolling back.
He then asked Rosenberg how he viewed the relationship between the DEA and the opioid industry going forward.
Kabul Bank, the country's biggest, nearly collapsed under the weight of $1 billion in fraudulent loans — an amount equal to one-twelfth of the country's entire economic output the year before.

In an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said that she believes Trump is a racist but that he's a symptom of a problem. The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things, Ocasio-Cortez told Anderson Cooper. A White House spokesman responded: Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform … [and] has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.

Just before Geldhof left, his two-year quest to persuade the DEA to take action against Miami-Luken finally paid off. In November 2015, the DEA accused the company of multiple violations of the law for allegedly failing to report orders for tens of millions of pain pills from pharmacies, most of them in West Virginia. That case — the most recent one to target a distributor — is pending.
The number of cases of coronavirus in the United States now stands at nearly five dozen, a figure that greatly increased when infected passengers were brought back from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Japan. The federal government has had to scramble in recent weeks to adjust, and the White House's coronavirus response has been uneven, with President Trump recently expressing anger that he was not involved in more decisions. While traveling in India on Monday, Trump declared on Twitter that the coronavirus is very much under control in the United States and that the stock market was looking good.

Did Alec die because he was rationing? The answer may never be absolutely clear, but his family is convinced that he was skimping on his doses. He never told his loved ones that he was rationing because of the expense, but they knew that the disease and its cost wore on him. He had talked to his parents about searching for jobs that offered health insurance. Laine had scouted the Internet for prescription discounts. Alec vented to his best friend, Erick Borrome, whose wife, Arizbeth, offered to get him cheap insulin from a pharmacy in Mexico, where she had family and a vial cost roughly $50. She says: We had many conversations about the insulin and the cost. He was pretty worried about it. But, she adds, he was too shy to accept help. He never took her up on the offer.
The other program is more utilitarian. This school of thinking, dating back to Victorian liberal thinkers led by John Stuart Mill, holds that we should aim to seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Sacrificing a few to save many, then, can be justified. This would lead to vaccinating those most likely to catch the virus and spread it, even if their mortality risk is low. Doctors and emergency workers would go first, followed arguably by prisoners, people who come into contact with lots of other people, and those in communities that are particularly susceptible to spread. This is pretty much the course being followed by most states in the U.S.

Even Federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. In 2013, years after he spoke at the founding Federalist Society symposium, and after he won Bush v. Gore, Ted Olson returned to the Supreme Court to overturn a California proposition banning same-sex marriage. For their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the Constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. Still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: Despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the Supreme Court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine, wrote recently in Slate.

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, a narrator says. The consequences? Drug deaths. Violent murder. Gang violence. We must not allow it. That's followed by Trump himself saying that liberals care more about illegal immigrants than Americans.

-- Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: [Biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat [Trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. … Yet Mr. Biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. … More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. … But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.
Hearing this from the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee is, quite candidly, a punch in the jaw of federal employees, said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal employees. Their mental anguish and anxiety is bad enough. To hear this coming straight from congressional leaders does not instill a lot of hope.
Instead of challenging the DEA, the attorneys suggested the industry may be better off averting DEA actions by taking even stronger compliance measures, according to an internal alliance memo.
The debate about whether FEMA can pay to rebuild churches and other places of worship increased in the early 2000s. Federal disaster assistance had been increasing as the agency grew, prompting debates about who got what.

The debate about FEMA funding doesn't affect a huge number of institutions, since FEMA designation only happens after rare major disasters such as the trio of hurricanes that hit the United States last year — Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico. For example, Diament said after Harvey four or five synagogues and a few dozen churches sought such aid, while in Florida there was less damage to such spots.

Presidential nominee John McCain, for instance, contradicted one of his supporters at a 2008 campaign event, telling her that Barack Obama was not, in fact, an Arab. Onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful Arlen Specter (Pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading GOP conspiracy theorists, Robertson and Pat Buchanan, as leaders of the intolerant right.
If Bernie does or doesn't get in, my concern is whether the progressive vote splits up and we have the same kind of nominee we had last time, said one early-state operative who was still deciding which candidate to work for. It would be great to have one strong, progressive voice. It's not going to happen.
Eli Lilly, which hasn't raised its insulin prices since May 2017, declines to discuss its pricing strategies in general. Asked for comment, it offered a statement: Some people pay too much for insulin at the pharmacy, and there are several reasons — including high deductible insurance plans that require people to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills before coverage is triggered. We're focused on finding solutions to the problem.

It certainly appears, more than ever, that the truth itself is on trial, as Peter Baker recently wrote in the New York Times. Some conservatives say Trump, and Trumpism, represent a new frontier of conspiratorial politics — that the theories are unique to Trump's sensibility and peculiar to his paranoid White House. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, former president George W. Bush said in a 2017 speech. The main problem behind the proliferation of political conspiracy theories is a president who is also a self-invented fabulist, argued Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.
The Post's calculation reflects 703,000 pending appeals across the country and 529,000 people waiting on a benefits decision in the states that publicly share that information or that responded to a request for comment, Alyssa Fowers and Heather Long report. People's claims have been held up for months at times for something as simple as a typo or uploading a scan of a driver's license instead of a photo. Most delays are the result of three key factors: extensive fraud prevention checks, antiquated computer systems and applications being flagged for extra scrutiny. Claims set aside for manual review often take months to resolve. The holdup in sending out unemployment aid has caused families to fall severely behind on rent, cancel medical treatments and struggle to buy food, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have yet to receive any money despite applying for unemployment in the spring or summer.
The lawsuit says UFC, Lesnar, White and others affirmatively circumvented and obstructed fair competition for their own benefit by willfully disregarding the promotion's anti-doping policy.
The pandemic has driven drops in attendance, college applications and academic performance among the nation's most vulnerable students: children who are low-income, Black or Hispanic, as well as those with learning disabilities and those whose first language is not English. All too often, homeless children — of whom there are 2.5 million every year in America — combine these factors, Hannah Natanson reports. Trying to learn inside shelters for the past nine months, students have faced spotty WiFi, crowded rooms, high noise levels and harassment from some peers who deduce, over Zoom, that they lack a home. … School officials in Northern Virginia, and nationwide, have gone to great lengths to reach vulnerable, struggling and low-income children. They have expanded Internet into school parking lots, provided families with WiFi hotspots and hand-delivered needed devices to households, including Chromebooks and iPads. … But homeless children pose a unique challenge. Their parents are sometimes unwilling or unable to communicate their circumstances. Some shelters, for example those catering to victims of abuse, take pains to hide their location. So, if a homeless child drops off the screen, it can prove impossible to track them.

Hutchison said he feels some remorse over receiving the vaccine ahead of a few of his firefighters who were not available that day. But it's better that it got utilized, and then we can get it out to the community, he said in an interview Wednesday.
The DEA had used an immediate suspension order against Walgreens, arguing that the drug sales constituted an imminent danger to the community. The DEA moved to shutter a large Walgreens distribution center in Jupiter, Fla., that supplied nearly 1,000 pharmacies along the East Coast.
This wasn't some effort to help drug companies kill people, he said. This was an effort to ensure that DEA's efforts . . . didn't end up hurting legitimate patients.
For example, Kleissle, the DEA supervisor in St. Louis, had told the company in 2010 after the Tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor's customers, the pharmacies and doctors.
Eating the rich. An under-noticed moment from Julián Castro's ABC News interview came when he was asked if he agreed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on taxes.

Another speaker was future solicitor general Ted Olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. I didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, Olson told me, but I did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. In his address to that first symposium, he said: I sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. Of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. But I think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.
The congressional staffers were furious. We can't work with you, one told the DEA.
Checking out a number of panels, I was impressed that, true to its claim, the Federalist Society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. People always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong I am, W.

* TRUMP JUST WEAKENED HIS OWN LEVERAGE: NBC News's Jonathan Allen notes that Trump's shithole comments may have made it harder for him to get a deal on the dreamers, meaning he'll now have to give up more:
The substance, which is imported from Southeast Asia and marketed as a supplement, has become increasingly popular among consumers looking for relief from pain, anxiety and depression as well as opioid-withdrawal symptoms. Kratom, which is sometimes used for recreation, can produce a feeling of euphoria.

Under one, the DEA has suspended the license of a drug company that was filling unusually large orders from several pharmacies.

The problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before, said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. There was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. Is it ideal? No. Is this a number that everyone wants to see? No. People would probably like to see more. But this is about more than money. It's about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.
The industry enlisted members of Congress to limit the powers of the Drug Enforcement Administration. It devised tactics to push back against the agency. And it commissioned a Crisis Playbook to burnish its image and blame the federal government for not doing enough to stop the epidemic.

Alec's funeral was held the day after the Fourth of July, his favorite holiday. Family and friends gathered at his parents' house in Richfield, a Minneapolis suburb, to shoot off fireworks in his memory. Those first few weeks were a blur, as Nicole tried in her grief to piece together the last days of Alec's life. The medical examiner had listed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the cause of death. By definition, he had died of a lack of insulin, but why and how did that happen?
To purchase loyalty and information, the CIA gave cash to warlords, governors, parliamentarians, even religious leaders, according to the interviews.

Today, Barnett is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the Affordable Care Act, medical marijuana and the like. But his first encounter with the Federalist Society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early Federalist Society national student symposiums. Barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the Constitution. But he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. So he said yes.
The Post first revealed Morhaim's dual roles in July, prompting the months-long inquiry from the ethics panel, which hired outside counsel to assist in the effort.
— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.
House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen.

Every time I have spoken to him, his instincts have always been very moderate, very common sense, Manchin said. By the time the last person comes in and hits him with this and that and the polls, we lose him.

The Redskins claimed Foster off waivers after he was arrested in Tampa on Nov. 24. It was his second arrest for domestic violence in 2018, and while those first charges, filed in California, were also dropped, the Niners released him the morning after the second incident. Two days later, Washington was the only team to put in a waiver claim for Foster. The NFL immediately placed him on the commissioner's exempt list while the league conducted an investigation into the Florida arrest. The NFL's personal conduct policy empowers the league to discipline a player without a criminal charge if it believes such measures are warranted.
I thought they did a good job in presenting the defense for the president, he said.

You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male minorities, 15 to 25. That's true in New York. It's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed.
Yet after almost two decades of help from Washington, the Afghan army and police are still too weak to fend off the Taliban, the Islamic State and other insurgents without U.S. military backup.

That's what I understand, Kelly said.
In the Lessons Learned interviews, U.S. and NATO officials said the glowing progress reports delivered to the public were largely an illusion and glossed over major deficiencies that were visible from the outset.
The Redskins were heavily criticized for claiming Foster so soon after a domestic violence arrest. Doug Williams, the team's senior vice president for player personnel, released a statement on the night Washington claimed Foster, saying the team would conduct an investigation into the incidents. He later apologized for making insensitive comments when trying to defend the move in a radio interview.
My feeling is that we're better off giving people one dose and hoping we'll get a second dose than holding back a second dose, said Walter A.

But, under pressure from the White House, Mr. Shanahan informed Mr. Sweeney on Friday that he was removing him as chief of staff Friday.
With the Afghan security forces lagging in quantity and quality, the U.S. military has been unable to extricate itself from the faraway conflict. Although the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan has dwindled from 100,000 eight years ago to 13,000 today, the Trump administration has had to escalate the war from the skies to prevent the Taliban from taking over.

Another jarring disconnect was that the United States and its allies could not agree on whether they were actually fighting a war in Afghanistan or doing something else, the NATO official said.
But others told government interviewers that the United States and its allies were foolish to encourage and excuse warlords' corrupt behavior.
Richard Haass, a senior diplomat who served as the Bush administration's special coordinator for Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, told government interviewers that he floated a proposal to deploy 20,000 to 25,000 U.S. troops, alongside an equal number of allied forces. But he said his plan was shot down.
Republicans have been predicting a Democratic crack-up on impeachment for nearly the entirety of the Trump presidency, and it simply hasn't happened.

Members of Congress left Washington while Trump remained at the White House, and each side blamed the other. Trump refers to the partial government closure as the Schumer shutdown.
The company's attorney, Gregory G. Garre, the former U.S. solicitor general during the second Bush administration, argued the imminent danger standard was vague and not supported by law. The original 1970 act did not define imminent danger.
March 29, 2020, issue: Witnessing the cherry blossoms each spring is both a feast for the eyes and a grounding experience that connects us to the wonders of nature. Since the coronavirus pandemic has kept most of us from seeing them up close, here's a reminder that the blooms will eventually come again — and that hope is just around the corner.
A recently passed House bill would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs, Holder said in a July 31 news release.
The next day, the DEA's chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency's investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Leslie Wizner, an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit.
By then, the opioid war had claimed 200,000 lives, more than three times the number of U.S. military deaths in the Vietnam War. Overdose deaths continue to rise. There is no end in sight.
Yet over the past seven decades, such voices — pro-fact, pro-science and pro-reason — lost the internal debate over how to treat the tinfoil-hat folks. And such moments of truth-telling by Republicans at all levels have been fleeting and rare.
In his Lessons Learned interview, Richards recalled having a tense encounter with Rumsfeld in 2006. The Pentagon chief asked the NATO commander why things were deteriorating in the south. Richards replied that it was because he did not have enough resources: And Rummy said 'General what do you mean?' I said, 'We don't have enough troops and resources and we've raised expectations.' He said 'General, I don't agree. Move on.'  David Richards | Lessons Learned interview | 9/27/2017Tap to view full document

Trump is in a glass house on this issue. Not only is his record on racial issues what it is — most notably on the Central Park Five and Charlottesville — but he has vocally supported the stop-and-frisk policy. During the 2016 campaign, he proposed bringing it nationwide, and he reiterated his support as recently as 2018. He could say Bloomberg's description of the policy is crass, but it was widely known that the policy did pretty much what Bloomberg said it did, and Trump backed it.
The company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. Mal­linckrodt also said that the DEA was aware of the company's increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. The DEA sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. The company also complained that the DEA has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders.
But Foster's on-field play has been overshadowed by several off-field incidents. He was sent home from the 2017 draft combine after he got into an argument with a hospital worker during a routine medical exam. Last winter, he was arrested in Tuscaloosa, Ala., for marijuana possession. The most serious allegations against him, however, are the charges of domestic violence in which he was twice arrested, in 2018, for allegedly hitting the same woman, Ennis.
And the most relevant example was the rhetoric of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). In early 2017, she said Democrats needed to impeach the president and stop his a--. In the summer of 2018, she was filmed encouraging protesters to push back on Trump Cabinet officials and tell them they're not welcome. That kicked off a multi-day news cycle, with speculation about Waters, whom the president personally attacks on Twitter and at rallies, disrupting the Democratic message.
Adante Pointer, the lawyer for Foster's accuser and ex-girlfriend, Elissa Ennis, said authorities in Tampa informed him Wednesday of their decision to drop the charge.
To put a clause like this in fighters' contracts, it's no money out of the UFC's pocket, Denning said. We're not asking them to pay anything additional, we're just asking them to include in all bout agreements a provision that says that the cheater has to forfeit to the non-cheater all of the profits. This happens in other sports.
Trump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy. When Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the million dollars a day that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.
They definitely didn't like Joe Rannazzisi, Murphy said. Not at all. He wasn't viewed as a person that they could work with. And maybe that was appropriate. He didn't want to work with industry much.

-- For his part, Trump continues to insist on unflinching loyalty. The chief of staff at the Pentagon has been forced out of his post because of White House concerns about his close ties to Mattis, the Wall Street Journal's Gordon Lubold reports: The Pentagon announced that Kevin Sweeney, a retired Navy rear admiral who had worked closely with Mr. Mattis, had stepped down. … Mr. Sweeney had worked alongside Mr. Mattis at several points during his career, including when Mr. Mattis was still in uniform … The bond was a source of concern to the White House, the U.S. officials said, adding the appointment of Pat Shanahan as acting secretary by [Trump] last month was seen as an opportunity to remove Mr. Sweeney. …

Indeed, many of my colleagues believe that the [Walgreens] case would have resulted in a narrowing of DEA's authority if the agency had not settled its dispute, Barber said.

In their search for answers, there was enough blame to go around. His family blamed the broken health-care system. They blamed unaffordable insurance and high out-of-pocket costs. They blamed a lot of things, including, in darker moments, themselves. But they kept coming back to the price of insulin. Why was a treatment that had been around for nearly 100 years so expensive? And what could be done about it?

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) was determined to reopen schools this fall. But changing plans and communication shortcomings on the part of the city, and shifting, hard-line demands on the part of the union, kept schools closed for months, squandering the chance to return the most vulnerable students to the classroom while infection rates were low, city officials, union leaders, educators and activists told The Post.
Durham County was the scene of one of the most lopsided upsets. Long a cigarette-manufacturing hub, its morning air for decades had a thick, sweet tobacco scent. But the Liggett & Myers factory closed in 2000, and now the county of about 312,000 has a tech-and-health-care economy, two universities and a reputation for liberal activism. Political discussions in Durham, from the courthouse to the coffee shops, often center on racial justice.
We have over 700 flights every month between Hawaii and Japan or South Korea, where the virus is spreading in the community, said Hawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green (D), who is also an emergency physician. It's unlikely that the CDC would allow state labs to accept a test from another nation, he said, but this is an exceptional circumstance.
Health insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.
The case had not ended up setting a precedent that undermined the standard. Rather than take the case to trial, the company agreed to settle and pay what was then a record $80 million fine. Still, Barber argued the DEA faced legal jeopardy.
It is very hard to disentangle the goal of reducing the overall numbers of immigrant arrivals from the goal of shifting our current ethnic and racial mix. But Trump has now left little to no doubt that the real animating impulse is the latter.
In a statement to The Post, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, the association that represents drug distributors, defended its support of the Marino bill, formally known as the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act.

The Democratic proposal holds out one exception: The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security, would keep its current level of funding, with no new money for a border wall. The plan would also extend the department's budget only through Feb. 8, allowing Democrats to revisit funding for key parts of Trump's immigration policy in a month.

In hundreds of confidential interviews that constitute a secret history of the war, U.S. and allied officials admitted they veered off in directions that had little to do with al-Qaeda or 9/11.

But having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the Federalist Society's expanding sway. For one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. When Trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a Supreme Court justice. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with Trump's future White House counsel, Don McGahn (also a society member), and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The list was expanded twice to include Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and others. Leo took a leave from his job at the Federalist Society to advise the White House on the confirmation process for Gorsuch and Kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the George W. Bush White House in putting Roberts and Alito on the court.

Drug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. Glaxo­SmithKline was fined $3 billion, and Pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. Purdue Pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation's opioid crisis: OxyContin. All of those cases were initiated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Alec would continue to be the face of a growing movement. In a few weeks, a letter from Nicole would be read at a conference in Washington about making prescription medicine affordable.

Barnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down Washington pressure group. The society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. No one at Federalist Society headquarters in Washington dictated Barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. It's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the Federalist Society that Barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and Barnett took it from there. Multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the Federalist Society's true source of power.

In April 2007, the DEA issued an immediate-suspension order for the Lakeland, Fla., distribution center of AmerisourceBergen, the third-largest drug distributor in the nation. Drug distributors based their hubs in Lakeland because it is centrally located near major highways.
Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of Supreme Court justices for the annual affair. There's also a trio of Trump's once and future Justice Department leaders: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (alumnus of the Federalist Society's Harvard Law School chapter), recently fired attorney general Jeff Sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker (recommended by Leonard Leo to be Sessions's chief of staff). It's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the Justice Department are minor actors compared with the Federalist Society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.

At medical centers, where front-line health-care providers have been vaccinated since nurse Sandra Lindsay received the first shot Dec. 14, it's difficult to avoid having a few extra doses at the end of each day. Caregivers occasionally miss appointments, or a few doses are left over from vials of five and 10, officials said.
Still, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors.

-- In a blog Warren wrote between 2005 and 2008, the then-Harvard law professor criticized Biden for a vote he cast in the Senate. NBC News's Jack Bohrer reports: In March of 2006, Warren wrote that Biden's 2005 vote in favor of the bankruptcy bill that spurred her foray into blogging made him part of 'a bi-partisan coalition to prefer powerful corporation [sic] over hard-working families.' 'For years, Senator Joe Biden vied with Republican Senators Charles Grassley and [Orrin] Hatch for head cheerleader for this bill,' Warren wrote. 'Even as he tried to position his national image as a strong supporter of women, Senator Biden was twisting arms to get the bankruptcy bill through Congress.'
To explain the impeachment inquiry, the GOP has promulgated a flurry of baseless conspiracy theories about the forces arrayed against President Trump. It has been surreal to hear some of the nation's most influential elected officials spouting ideas basically concocted from thin air. The House Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.), denounces Ukrainian election meddling in 2016 . . . aimed against the Trump campaign. The Judiciary Committee's Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) claims that if Congress could only talk to a certain three Democratic officials, then every fact of this investigation would be unearthed. Conservatives online hold that former White House aide Fiona Hill was a mole planted by George Soros.

He was on a panel about freedom of association. Most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the Constitution. Some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the Constitution by activist judges. On the panel, Barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. And so, Barnett told me, I said at the end of my little talk, 'I know what you're thinking: What gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the Constitution?'  He recalled that he paused dramatically. And then, as I had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. And when I said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.

What Alec soon learned was just how much his insulin would end up costing: more than $1,000 a month. The price of insulin — once modest — has skyrocketed in recent years, making the lifesaving medication a significant, even burdensome, expense, especially for the uninsured and underinsured. The costs are so heavy that they have driven some patients to ration their supplies of the drug in a dangerous gamble with life-threatening consequences.

First, the party in power is not great at guessing whom it should run against. It's an open secret that Republicans consider Warren to be the weakest top-tier Democratic candidate. The arguments for that run from the sensible (President Trump has defined her effectively as Pocahontas) to the fanciful (she's a female baby boomer and Trump already beat one of those). Early polling backs some of this up; Quinnipiac's pre-Christmas survey found that 37 percent of voters already viewed Warren negatively, more than any other Democrat.

But the party is not behaving the way it did in 2016. By this point in the previous cycle, 63 Democratic members of Congress had already endorsed Clinton, who was months away from announcing her campaign. As of right now, no Democratic member of Congress has endorsed a potential presidential candidate. The idea of candidates jumping in to prevent a rallying effect for someone else is, for now, defunct, and the results in 2016 (such as Sanders's landslide win in New Hampshire) cut against the idea that endorsements from prominent Democrats can move votes.

His belief that he could keep his role as a legislator advocating for the implementation of policy and regulations for the use of medical cannabis, separate from his position as a paid consultant for a company seeking to enter the medical cannabis business reflects poor judgment to the detriment of the broader interests of the public, and it has eroded the confidence and trust of the public and other governmental officials who work with legislators, bringing disrepute and dishonor to the General Assembly, the report states.

Newsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.

If we have learned anything from the coronavirus and swine flu H1N1 epidemic of 2009, it is that we cannot necessarily depend on other countries, even close allies, to supply us with needed items, from face masks to vaccines, said Peter Navarro, a senior White House adviser on trade and manufacturing policy.

Others argued that because of the severity and persistence of the pandemic, the strategy of holding in reserve a second dose to ensure people get their booster shot on time is too conservative. The first shot trains the immune system to recognize the coronavirus, but the second is necessary to muster a full response, cementing the immunologic memory that was more than 90 percent effective at preventing illness in clinical trials.
The supply-and-demand realities of the drug trade are why reform groups, like the Drug Policy Alliance, say that federal funds would be better spent helping drug users, rather than cracking down on drug suppliers. You can take out a heroin dealer, but the addictions he's feeding will remain. Another dealer will happily step forward to serve those addictions as long as demand remains.
The Redskins have long been intrigued by Foster, who was the 49ers' first-round draft pick in 2017. He starred at Alabama, where he played with several current Washington players and was considered one of the best linebackers in college football.

There's plenty of overlap between Warren and Sanders on policy, and both are likely to get rounded into one of the press's lanes or tiers as the left's potential candidate. But one of the most interesting debates inside the Democratic Party right now is between Sanders's democratic socialism and Warren's reformed progressivism. By doing so well in 2016, Sanders exploded the popularity of a political philosophy that had been sidelined in the United States for 100 years; Warren hasn't had the same platform to spell out what she stands for.
The agency again notified distributors and manufacturers that their pills were being diverted to the streets, and they had a responsibility under the law to monitor and report suspicious activity.

Busch and Miller said they knew nothing about Hogan's plans to secure federal land for the Redskins to build a new stadium in Prince George's County. Hogan has said no tax money would be used to build the stadium. But the presiding officers said the stadium would need infrastructure, including sidewalks, sewer and roads. Busch opposes it, and Miller has questions about using land that is rich in history.

We did a Phase 3 trial which taught us that two doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine induced excellent, high-level protection against disease. We don't know whether a half-dose would do that; we don't know if a single dose would do that, Offit said.

But the United States may not have time to wait for better data before it acts. It appears that the new variant is still rare in the United States, but that could change quickly. For exponential processes, small initial differences can mean gargantuan differences in the long run, Zeynep writes.

Dec. 30, 2018, issue: We all remember what it's like to board a roller coaster for the first time. The sweaty palms. The pang of No Going Back once you get buckled into your seat by the attendant. The dizzying heights just as the ride crests. Maybe it isn't all that different from confronting the arrival of a new year — especially given the rather tumultuous times in which we live. As I grow older, I find that years go by much quicker, artist Jean Jullien notes. Too quick. At a scary pace, actually. And at the beginning of the year, you never know what it's going to be like, but there's no way of going back and no way of stopping the movement.
One of our member companies had been contacted by Mr. Marino, said Kelly, the top lobbyist for the alliance, which by then had changed its name to the Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA).

Many diabetics continue to hunt for coupons and discounts on high-priced insulins. Some doctors will give out samples to struggling patients. The constant search for more insulin can become all-consuming. I think about it when I wake up.

There is no way he can pay what I do, she says.
Besides the sponsors and co-sponsors of the bill, few lawmakers knew the true impact the law would have. It sailed through Congress and was passed by unanimous consent, a parliamentary procedure reserved for bills considered to be noncontroversial. The White House was equally unaware of the bill's import when President Barack Obama signed it into law, according to interviews with former senior administration officials.

Perhaps the biggest change of the Trump era is the approach of Republican leaders. In the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. Today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. National security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that Ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-Russian propaganda. Yet most Republican members of Congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in Politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. Trump's racism (calling Mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all U.S. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-Semitism (he implies Jews are loyal primarily to Israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that Jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.
We want to spend a lot of money, put a lot of cops in the street, put those cops where the crime is, which is in the minority neighborhoods. So this is — one of the unintended consequences is, people say, Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities. Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is. And the first thing you can do for people is to stop them getting killed. Now we did a calculation of how many people who would have been dead if we hadn't brought down the murder rate and gotten guns off the streets. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw 'em against the wall and frisk 'em. And then they start — they say, I don't want to get caught, so they don't bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.
Worse, they said, Obama tried to set artificial dates for ending the war before it was over. All the Taliban had to do was wait him out.

Working with President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the goal is to transform the federal judiciary.
Trump also opposes the current deal because it would restrict family-based immigration (in which current immigrant citizens or permanent residents sponsor relatives for entry) only for the parents of the dreamers and some others, whereas Trump wants much greater reductions in family-based immigration. But as Dara Lind points out, while this debate is complicated, this functionally means large reductions in the numbers of people from countries who already have large immigrant populations here — which means resisting trends shaping our current ethnic and national mix.

Hopefully late this year, life should begin to feel similar to pre-pandemic times.

The warnings didn't work. The DEA decided to get tougher. It had several tools at its disposal, in ascending order of severity: It could send a company a letter of admonition warning it to follow the law; it could send an order to show cause demanding to know why operations should not be shut down for failing to report suspicious orders; it could issue an immediate suspension order instantly halting operations; or it could bring a civil or criminal enforcement case with heavy fines.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the Federalist Society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response.

After a succession of quick military victories in 2001 and early 2002, Bush decided to keep a light force of U.S. troops in Afghanistan indefinitely to hunt suspected terrorists. Soon, however, he made plans to invade another nation — Iraq — and Afghanistan quickly became an afterthought.
The next year, NATO forces in Afghanistan got a new commander: McNeill, the general whose name Bush had once forgotten. McNeill was ordered back to Afghanistan to take command a second time as the Taliban launched a wave of suicide attacks and began planting bombs all over the country.

The trick is to use it wisely.

Even for his older sister, Brittany Smith, who is a nurse, the learning curve about Type 1 diabetes was steep. I didn't really have a handle on it, she says. Most of her diabetic patients had the far more common Type 2. Both types involve an imbalance of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels. For Type 1 diabetics, the body produces little to no insulin. In Type 2, generally, the body has become resistant to insulin's effects. Not all Type 2 diabetics take insulin, but all Type 1 diabetics do. Alec would need a steady supply for the rest of his life.

In August, the company started the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, a help line to assist people who need help paying for their insulin. Fenner said a coupon she received from the help line dropped the monthly cost of one of her son's insulins from $900 to $95. It's an incredible boon, but she already worries how long Eli Lilly will keep the savings going. According to the American Diabetes Association, these kinds of measures are just a stopgap: The organization's June 2018 report concluded that corporate patient assistance programs are not deemed to be a long-term or comprehensive answer to the rising cost of insulin for the vast majority of people with diabetes. Several people, including Fenner, described insulin as being like oxygen: Scavenging for it invokes a primal fear, like the gasp you make just before you run out of air.
In his December 2009 speech at the U.S. Military Academy, he announced he would deploy 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, on top of the 70,000 that he and Bush had previously authorized. NATO and other U.S. allies would increase their forces to 50,000.

However, voters can't be infinitely forgiving: I think we aren't so naive to expect moral piety from representatives pragmatically dealing with messy expectations. But demanding an official resign or be otherwise punished for immoral, and certainly criminal, behavior is important to signal a standard of values and conduct for the wider community.

April 14, 2019, issue: This week marks the premiere of the final season of the HBO series 'Game of Thrones.' I wanted this image of Daenerys (a character who represents political change) and her dragon Drogon flying past the Washington Monument to feel both melancholic and festive — like a farewell party.
We had a situation where it was just out of control because of [Rannazzisi], Marino said. His only mission was to get big fines. He didn't want to [do] anything but put another notch in his belt.
Jan. 6, 2019, issue: Yes, it's winter. Yes, it's cold. But there's no question we live on a warming planet. The cracks are starting to show: A recent Trump administration report said that the effects of climate change, including wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves, are already battering the United States. I don't think it takes a science degree to see what is happening in the world, artist Jon Krause says. Neil deGrasse Tyson had a great quote in 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey' discussing the mass extinction of species: 'The dinosaurs never saw that asteroid coming.' Climate change is our generation's impending asteroid. Hopefully we can make the necessary changes to ensure our fate isn't the same as theirs.
During meetings at resorts in places like Pebble Beach, Calif., and Palm Beach, Fla., the industry alliance charted a way to respond. They implemented a political strategy that they knew the DEA believed would result in tying the agencies [sic] hands to actively and aggressively address diversion and compliance, according to an internal alliance memo that is now part of the case.
Walden said in a statement Thursday that he is still waiting for guidance on how to rewrite the law from the DEA.
The president is trying to mobilize a show of strength that could intimidate lawmakers who certify the result, exhorting his supporters to travel to Washington for mass protests Wednesday. He is planning to speak to the crowd on the Ellipse around midday Wednesday … Trump is befuddled as to why many more Republicans are not falling in line with him, advisers said. … Still, Trump is not entirely blind to reality. He has asked several advisers in recent weeks for advice on what he should do instead of attending [Biden's] inauguration on Jan. 20.
According to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, Mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. But the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. Mallinckrodt contended that the DEA has never required manufacturers to know their customers' customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law.

WHAT THEY SAID IN PUBLIC July 23, 2018 We're on the right track. Again, this is a tough war. It's a war. A war is a contest of wills. The Afghan army and police are demonstrating a will to succeed. — Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, in a press briefing from Kabul
At the time, McNeill commanded about 8,000 troops — a tiny fraction of the number that would ultimately go to Afghanistan. A few contrarians in the Bush administration pushed to do more.
What's confusing is the speculation that Tlaib will hurt her party politically. True, the House Democratic majority, and the leaders of the relevant committees, have no plan to impeach the president until and unless Republicans believe it's necessary. They've said it many times. To the extent Tlaib forced them to say it again, they had a bad news cycle.
-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an Iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using Trump's name. Annie Linskey and Chelsea Janes report: She aimed directly at voters tempted by [Trump's] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of Trump himself almost entirely. … For Warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. That was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.
WHAT THEY SAID IN PUBLIC June 1, 2016 [They] performed better this year than they were performing last year, and based on that, we are cautiously optimistic about the coming months. — Army Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, in a news briefing on the Afghan security forces
If these are your operating principles, and if you believe the other side will irrevocably alter them, then holding onto power isn't negotiable. Denial isn't so much a political decision as a religious conviction. Or, as one political soothsayer recently said to me: When politics becomes your religion, people become irrational.
DEA officials later said the standards did not change.
Third, the two parties' voters are different. The most interesting aspect of Warren's launch video was how it diverged from the messaging of every recent Democratic nominee for president. In 2016, Republicans got behind a candidate who argued that there was no compromise with the political class and that a strong leader was needed to dismantle it. Democrats have generally argued that good people can differ and unite against the minority of special interests keeping the government from answering voters' needs.
FEMA's new funding rules were released in an update to the policy guide for the agency. Similar rules are in a House measure that passed late last year and in a pending Senate bill. They are being challenged by church-state advocacy groups that say they violate the First Amendment's prohibition on the government establishing religion.
Lulled into overconfidence by the apparent ease of conquering Afghanistan, the Bush administration refused to sit down with defeated Taliban leaders to negotiate a lasting peace — a decision U.S. officials would later regret.
In Washington, the soaring price of insulin has provoked bipartisan concern. Members of Congress are trying to parse the factors that have caused the spike. In November, a congressional caucus released a report on insulin, urging legislation aimed at lowering prices through increased competition and pricing transparency, among other recommendations. In June, the American Medical Association called on the government to monitor insulin pricing and market competition and take enforcement actions as appropriate. Insulin, in some ways, serves as a proxy for the rising prices across the U.S. prescription drug market. On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump railed against high drug prices, and his administration has vowed to lower them, releasing a flurry of proposals in the past year.
The wall, it turned out, was inside Afghanistan's presidential palace. Months after the raid, investigators wiretapped a conversation in which a senior aide to Karzai allegedly agreed to block the New Ansari probe in exchange for a bribe.
Heidi Shalev, a spokeswoman for Austin Regional Clinic, told the American-Statesman that once word got out, there were so many people standing in line that we wanted to get everybody through and we wanted to use every vial of vaccine that we had. We wanted to make sure none went to waste. We did learn that a sign-up process in the future is something that we'll do.
People with confirmed cases can enroll in clinical trials for therapeutics. For patients who need more intense care in a facility with a biocontainment unit, that facility can receive reimbursement from the federal government for care, the official said.
In his Lessons Learned interview, Strmecki said another fundamental problem was that the U.S. government lacked the capacity to train and equip large foreign armies from scratch.
Petty corruption was rampant.

Though some Senate Republicans broke with Trump and leadership Thursday, others cautioned about what would happen if he caved on his signature promise.
-- Among the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish fighters that U.S. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the Islamic State, Karen DeYoung and Karoun Demirjian report. While Trump has expressed confidence that Turkey, which controls its own Syrian force opposed to both the Kurds and to President Bashar al-Assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the Islamic State, Pentagon and State Department officials question Turkish priorities and capabilities. … Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving Iran from Syria was also an objective for both the United States and Israel. But Trump appeared to indicate Sunday that both Iran and Russia, whose forces in Syria back Assad, were potential U.S. allies against the Islamic State.
Kadzik wrote to a colleague at Justice about Barber.
We deferred to DEA, as is common practice, he said.
Busch said the policy initiatives are just as important, if not more so, than the school construction.
A recent poll commissioned by Club for Growth, a conservative group, shows 69 percent of 500 West Virginia voters surveyed oppose impeaching the president. That is consistent with other public polling in the state, where Trump won by 42 percent over Hillary Clinton.
-- Mayor Muriel Bowser's nominee for D.C. schools chancellor is expected to endure a rigorous confirmation process following recent education-related scandals. Perry Stein reports: Several D.C. Council members offered blistering critiques of the school system in speeches last week as they were sworn in for their next terms. The 13-member council approves mayoral nominations and will review Bowser's selection of Lewis D. Ferebee as schools chancellor. … The District's top education job became vacant nearly a year ago when Antwan Wilson, barely a year into his stint as chancellor, was forced to resign after it was discovered that he skirted city rules to get one of his children a spot in a coveted high school.
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) forwarded Roy's statement to the Senate Republican Conference. With respect to presidential elections, there is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state's election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented, Lee emailed his colleagues on Monday.
Mitchell, 70, began her political career as a Democrat, helping win passage of Oklahoma's Equal Rights Amendment for women … Mitchell, then known by her maiden name of Deatherage, married Duane Draper, a fellow Oklahoman, and divorced in 1982. He later came out as a gay man, became director of the Massachusetts AIDS policy office and died in 1991; he had the disease when he died. Mitchell married her second husband, Dale Mitchell, chairman of the board of Fidelity National Bank, in 1984, taking his last name. … Two years later, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary. In 1992, Dale Mitchell was convicted of bank fraud, an experience that Cleta Mitchell later said was the result of 'overreaching government regulation.' She became increasingly disenchanted with the social liberal policies she had supported and moved to Washington to become director of the Term Limits Institute. Then she started doing legal work for the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association.

Pence's event was interrupted by someone who shouted a demand that Pence overturn the presidential election results, Cleve Wootson, Michael Scherer, David Weigel and Reis Thebault report. Biden turned Trump's efforts to overturn the November election results into a rallying cry to drive Democrats to the polls on Tuesday … At the final public rallies for Loeffler, her loudest applause came not when discussing her background in business, or the 'radical liberal' agendas of the Democrats, but when discussing Republican challenges to the Nov. 3 vote. … The Democratic candidates spent the closing days of the race trying to refocus the campaign on more local concerns such as health care and jobs, even as they brought in star power to help seal the deal and continued to jab at Trump. A closing ad for [Jon] Ossoff featured narration by former president Barack Obama and a musical appearance by John Legend. … Democrats, who have long considered themselves underdogs in the runoff contests, have been cheered by early vote numbers and clear signs in the state that many core Democratic constituencies, including suburban and urban voters, remained engaged.
-- Trump's trade war is increasingly disrupting U.S. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. The New York Times's Peter S. Goodman reports: In the United States, factories that buy steel and aluminum — now more expensive — are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. Some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of American tariffs. Companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. … The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.
By 2006, the Afghan government had self-organized into a kleptocracy Christopher Kolenda | Lessons Learned interview | 4/5/2016Tap to view full document under which people in power could plunder the economy without restraint, according to Christopher Kolenda, a retired Army colonel who advised several U.S. commanders during the war.

We thank the Trump administration for righting this longtime wrong and treating disaster-damaged churches, synagogues and other houses of worship fairly — on the same terms as other nonprofits such as museums, community centers and libraries stricken by natural disaster, said Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union, a major U.S. Orthodox Jewish organization.

-- Moreover, the U.S.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of Trump's announcement. Between December 16 and December 29, US-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting ISIS in Syria, CNN reports. The strikes were carried out against ISIS fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities … Prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in Syria as fighting around the ISIS-held town of Hajin ramped up.
Nicole hadn't known much about the world of diabetes advocacy before Alec died. But now she felt a budding activism as she encountered a flood of information and stories like her own online.
More Republicans criticize Trump's attempt to pressure Georgia election officials.
That justification skips over the fact that the policy was controversial not just because of whom it targeted, but also the constitutionality of searching people who weren't accused of crimes. A federal judge struck it down in 2016 for that reason.
Progressive lawmakers such as Warren (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of Congress and the business interests who lobby them. Last year, a study published in the American Political Science Review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed Congress's perception of what the American public wants.
(Utilitarians also think in terms of maximizing the amount of life saved. To use the ethical jargon, if we aim to maximize the number of quality-adjusted life years, then saving the elderly, who already live restricted lives, grows harder to justify.)
Prosecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to Florida were excessive and should have been reported as suspicious. Or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 Mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in Florida in 2009 and 2010.

Also, an earlier version of the chart incorrectly said that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America supported the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. The organization listed the bill in disclosing its lobbying expenditures, but took no position on it.
He also repeated his dubious claim that savings from a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada would make good on his pledge that Mexico would pay for the border wall. The trade deal has yet to be ratified by Congress and includes no direct mechanism to fund the wall. Trump's argument has been widely debunked by factcheckers.
Initial estimates suggest that the virus could be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible, although there's still much that we don't know about the new variant. It could turn out that the transmissibility has been overstated and that the dominance of the virus in the U.K. is due to chance or changed behavior among people.
As you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion, prosecutors wrote in their offer.
This supply-side approach has been in place at the federal level since the dawn of the drug war: The federal drug budget has traditionally emphasized approaches like destroying plants, intercepting drug shipments and arresting the people who sell drugs. The logic is straightforward: You reduce the supply of drugs, those drugs become more expensive, and the higher prices drive down demand and use of the drugs. Economics 101, right?
The lawsuit alleges the exemption came just a month before UFC sold for more than $4 billion to Hollywood talent agency WME-IMG, and accuses UFC of wrongfully jeopardizing fighter health and safety for profit.
It was the first time the DEA had targeted a manufacturer of opioids for alleged violations of laws designed to prevent diversion of legal narcotics to the black market. And it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued.
March 24, 2019, issue: The revival of the social calendar in spring is an East Coast thing.

Strmecki said the dispute dragged on even as it became clearer in 2004 and 2005 that the Afghan forces needed to expand quickly to fight a resurgent Taliban.

After four months of repeated requests, DOJ finally offered specific feedback to this committee's questions, stating they believe the law does impede the DEA's ability to do its job, said Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), then chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
We felt bad taking someone's place but the vaccines would have gone to waste. Are we rationalizing? she added, according to the article.
According to the interviews, the CIA, the U.S. military, the State Department and other agencies used cash and lucrative contracts to win the allegiance of Afghan warlords in the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Intended as a short-term tactic, the practice ended up binding the United States to some of the country's most notorious figures for years.

Slaoui told CBS's Face the Nation that giving half-doses to people between the ages of 18 and 55 triggers the same immune response as two full shots of the recommended 100 microgram dose and would allow officials to immunize twice as many people with the vaccine currently available. Any changes to the vaccine doses would ultimately require FDA approval.
A year after Khalilzad's Lessons Learned interview, Trump pulled him back into public service by tapping him as the U.S. envoy for negotiations with the Taliban.
In April 2002, Defense Secretary Donald H.

Messonnier said the agency was weighing widening its testing protocols to include people traveling to the United States from countries beyond mainland China, considering the rapid spread of the virus in other places in recent days.
The interviews were conducted by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, an agency created by Congress to uncover fraud and waste in the war zone. In 2014, SIGAR launched a special project titled Lessons Learned to examine policy failings from the war. It interviewed more than 600 people who played a direct role in the conflict, from military commanders to aid workers.
Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan declined to comment on the use of the vaccine beyond the conditions in its emergency authorization. At this point we wouldn't have any further information to share about any potential ongoing regulatory discussions, Jordan said.
Nicole now believes that Alec was rationing his insulin because of the cost. Based upon what he had left when he was found, we came to the conclusion that he had not filled his prescription, so he had to have been rationing for a short period of time, Nicole told me. We realized that he had been taking less insulin and less often than he should, trying to make it stretch until he got his next paycheck. He was found dead three days before payday.
Both declarations backfired spectacularly. Iraq descended into civil war. Meanwhile, as the U.S. government fixated on Iraq, the Taliban steadily regrouped.

While police officers are not directly involved in those tests, authorities usually set up tolerance areas around testing tents, where consumers will not be arrested for drug use. Volunteers inside the tents use laboratory equipment to examine the substances in tests that take about half an hour on average using infrared light. The visual analysis can quickly reveal possible contamination or whether a drug consumer was sold a different drug.
He doesn't exactly have the president's ear, but Buchanan's political thinking neatly lines up with Trump's. Here he makes an argument you might hear a lot of on the right — that the growing diversity of the Democratic Party's coalition will weaken it ahead of 2020.

Rannazzisi, a lawyer himself, told the DEA attorneys that the law was on their side.
To avoid controversy, SIGAR sanitized the harshest criticisms from the Lessons Learned interviews and omitted the names of more than 90 percent of the people it spoke with. It also scrapped plans to publish a separate report on deficiencies in the Afghan war strategy.
The rising prices from Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have raised suspicions. The companies appear to have increased them in lockstep over a number of years, prompting allegations of price fixing. All three companies denied these charges when I contacted them. (In 2010, Mexico fined Eli Lilly and three Mexican companies for price collusion on insulin, an allegation Eli Lilly also denied.) In the United States, a federal prosecutor and at least five state attorneys general are currently investigating the companies' pricing practices, according to Kaiser Health News. In October, Minnesota became the first state to sue the companies over insulin prices. And in January 2017, potential class-action lawsuits alleging price fixing by the three companies began making their way through the courts on behalf of diabetics. The companies denied the suits' allegations.
Kathleen Rice has fatally misjudged Democrats in her district, said Evan Roth Smith of Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. Sixty-five percent of primary voters want to see unity among Democrats, and less than half say they're likely to vote for Rice again after her opposition to Pelosi. Rice may think she's taking a principled stand, but primary voters see it as craven political grandstanding and are punishing her accordingly.
So these questions are for senators to ask the DEA? Pifko asked.
There's a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and minority. This, too, leaves a divided society. And whatever the causes, the effect is discrimination. My friend Phyllis Hunter (ph), of Houston, Texas, calls reading the new civil right. Equality in our country will remain a distant dream until every child, of every background, learns so that he or she may strive and rise in this world. No child in America should be segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt. (APPLAUSE) There's reason for optimism in this land. A great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; to blow the whistle on failure; to provide parents with options to increase their option, like charters and choice; and also remember the role of education is to leave no child behind. I believe in these principles, and I've seen them work; I've seen them turn around troubled schools in my state, schools labeled by the world at-risk. At-risk means you're not supposed to learn, but we've challenged that in the state of Texas. I've seen these schools and principles bring new hope, inspiring new confidences and ambitions. And I'm especially proud, in my state, that we're improve--our minority students are improving faster than almost any other state in the union.

Surfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, Teles explains. There's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. The judges need scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, Teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.

I'm optimistically, and I'm sure naively, hoping that the 2020 elections can cathartically reassure voters of the soundness of the democratic process.
In Afghanistan, patronage has traditionally been at the core of how government and society function. As an example, Boucher admiringly cited Gul Agha Sherzai, a warlord who reportedly amassed a fortune by skimming taxes and contracts while serving as a provincial governor.

Typical of narcissists, Trump demonstrated no capacity for empathy, whether it was letting stand a dubious policy of separating children from their immigrant parents — many of whom remain lost to their families — or demonstrating little concern for hurricane victims beyond their walk-on role in his continuing reality show.
The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.

Not only do the Americans have InSight probing the surface of Mars like a planetary doctor, but now China has a rover, Yutu-2 (or Jade Rabbit-2), on the far side of the moon, a first in space exploration. I like thinking and reading up on space exploration, most times to escape other things in the news, Ortiz says. It also often gives me perspective on how small I am.
In reality, U.S. officials backed off, looked away and let the thievery become more entrenched than ever, according to a trove of confidential government interviews obtained by The Washington Post.
Senator Hatch has had a strong working relationship with DEA for his entire term of service and worked collaboratively for months with DEA here. Any claim that he tried to steamroll DEA or would ever seek to steamroll DEA is simply incorrect.

Although McChrystal's comments were made on ABC two days prior, Trump did not comment publicly until he responded Tuesday morning to a tweet from conservative commentator Laura Ingraham.
But more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the Federalists have achieved. This position might be summed up as: If you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents. Advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the Federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.

Inmate status will not make a difference in terms of timing of receipt of the vaccine, the spokesman said. Someone who falls into a category for early priority of the vaccine and is in custody will receive the vaccine at the same time as someone in the same category who is outside our correctional facilities.
What had been a carefree 20-something existence was now dominated by insulin injections, timing of doses and taking a blood sample four times a day to measure glucose levels. I know he'd get frustrated, Nicole says. Within three months, though, Alec had gotten his blood sugar under control. He maintained healthy levels as that first year wore on. He began dating Laine and worked as a manager at the restaurant where they'd met. Eventually, he moved out of his parents' home and into his own apartment on a tree-lined street near downtown Minneapolis.
The bill would also give drug companies the opportunity to submit corrective action plans — outlines of how they were going to fix problems — before the DEA could sanction them. The DEA would be required to consider those plans before imposing penalties.

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he wants to share the panel's testimony transcripts with Mueller to determine whether any witnesses have committed perjury. I don't want to go into enumerating particularly who I have concerns about, but I do have concerns about certainly multiple witnesses, Schiff said on CNN. Bob Mueller, by virtue of the fact that he has been able to conduct this investigation using tools that we didn't have in our committee, meaning compulsion, is in a better position to determine, OK, who was telling the truth? Who wasn't? And who can I make a case against in terms of perjury? (Politico)
Belatedly, U.S. officials came to realize it was impossible to vanquish the group. Today, Pentagon officials say the only way to end the war is with a political settlement in which the Taliban reconciles with the Afghan government.
In a Lessons Learned interview, Ryan Crocker, who twice served as the top U.S. diplomat in Kabul, said he held no illusions about Fahim Khan.

One of the best elucidations of the two politicians' differences came last year from David Dayen, who's set to become the editor of the liberal magazine the American Prospect. Warren, wrote Dayen, wants to make capitalism work for everyone, while Sanders does not think it can.
There are T1International activists like Hattie Saltzman, a college student in Missouri who went a year without buying insulin because she couldn't afford her monthly $550 insulin bill. Her father shared some of his insulin, and she got free samples from her doctor. At one point, she told me, I had rationed insulin so extensively that it expired. I didn't catch that until I went to the ER because my blood sugars were through the roof. When the diabetic daughter of family friends died of cystic fibrosis, the family donated her leftover insulin to Saltzman. That got her through the year until she qualified for better insurance coverage.
-- Politico Magazine, Jerry Brown's Midnight in America, by John F. Harris: At age 80, Brown is leaving the governorship of the nation's largest state in a few hours, at noon on Monday. If this departure seems a bit reluctant—he pauses slightly, before demurring when I ask him if he wishes he could keep his job—it is emphatically on his own terms. A leader who at times has been treated as a figure of ridicule has vindicated his place as one of the most serious people in American life across two generations. … He is not full of warm words about the native wisdom of the people: They strike him as scared, easily prone to distraction and cynical manipulation. He is not more optimistic than ever: He is worried the planet is hurtling toward catastrophe.
Another unidentified senior U.S. official told government interviewers, however, that U.S. spy agencies had known about troubles inside Kabul Bank a year before the meltdown.
This shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.
In the real world, it hasn't quite worked out that way. Here, for instance, is data on federal spending on supply-side drug control going back to 1981. The numbers are adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars.
The blueprint includes more than 50 proposals. There is not a single silver bullet that's going to reduce drug prices across the board, says Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor and drug-pricing researcher who is a colleague of Luo's at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Some of the proposals are nonstarters, he argues, such as punishing other countries for the low prices they pay on drugs. (Americans pay more for drugs than any other nationality, but the governments of many other developed countries regulate drug prices, which keeps them lower.) A better solution would be to focus on what makes our pharmaceutical market inefficient, Kesselheim says. Focusing on this concept of foreign freeloading is, I think, a political distraction.

Like Sanders, who may end up joining the race, Warren simply does not use the language of compromise or national unity; she uses the language of resistance. As they pile into the race, some Democrats will find themselves arguing for a return to the less divisive politics of the pre-Trump era, while others, such as Warren, will call for a president to dismantle the financial forces that made Trump's win possible. To those in the latter camp, Trump never could have won had he not been able to define himself as a blue-collar billionaire against Clinton's Wall Street supporters; for them, in 2020, the job will be giving him an opponent who can make a populist case against him.
In August 2009, Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, then-commander of U.S. and NATO forces, wrote a classified 66-page assessment of the war that called for a properly resourced counterinsurgency campaign and laid out his proposed strategy in meticulous detail.

Moreover, supply restraints have never really been a problem for the U.S. heroin market, according to Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, a drug law reform group.
Under federal law and DEA policy, pharmaceutical companies such as Mallinckrodt are required to know their customers and monitor the pattern, frequency and amounts of drug orders. When suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their DEA licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.

In its database tracking drug shipments, the DEA could see the flow of opioids from some of the nation's largest manufacturers and distributors to an increasing number of pain management clinics, some of which became fronts for illegal pill mills. The DEA took its offensive to the next level.
In early May, 10 months after Alec died, Nicole flew to Indianapolis to attend a shareholder meeting at Eli Lilly headquarters. Her trip had been coordinated in part by T1International. Before the meeting, a small band of activists gathered outside. One held a neon-pink poster that read: Your insulin is a life saver. Your prices are poison.
In several ways, Manchin is distinct. He was reelected in 2018 after Trump went into his state several times, telling West Virginians that their senator was consistently voting against the president's agenda. An array of presidential surrogates also visited the state to campaign for Patrick Morrissey, Manchin's opponent.
Former DEA agents and agency lawyers have told The Post it would be virtually impossible to show that a drug company thousands of miles from a particular community was posing a present risk.
There is also another, less known corporate entity in the mix: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which include Express Scripts, OptumRx and CVS Health; all are now named in lawsuits on high insulin prices, but these companies also deny any wrongdoing. PBMs manage the prescription drug benefits that are part of insurance plans, working with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate discounts on behalf of insurance providers. Every time a PBM extracts a deeper discount, an insulin manufacturer has the incentive to take a price increase to quote 'make themselves whole,'  says Rena Conti, a health economist at Boston University. That's probably one reason why, even as Eli Lilly's list price for Humalog insulin has increased by 175 percent since 2009, the company maintains that its net price — the amount the company earns after rebates, discounts and fees — has remained steady.
Obama tore up Bush's counterterrorism strategy and approved a polar-opposite plan — a massive counterinsurgency campaign, backed by 150,000 U.S. and NATO troops, as well as tons of aid for a weak Afghan government.

I already put the word out.
Prosecutors noted that the DEA had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. They also said Mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as Florida.
Manchin, 72, isn't the only moderate Democrat who White House aides said they believe could vote to acquit the president. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) are also considered possibilities because they represent states Trump won in 2016.

In a viral web video, a new lawmaker vows to carry her Glock around D.C. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) is seen strapping the Glock to her hip before appearing to embark on a walk around Capitol Hill. A spokesman for Boebert said she was not carrying the gun throughout the video shoot, despite the opening scene. D.C. gun laws do not recognize concealed-carry licenses from other states, and nonresidents must register firearms with D.C. police, Meagan Flynn reports. Asked about the ad on Monday, acting D.C. police chief Robert J. Contee III said Boebert would have to follow applicable laws if she wanted to carry a firearm on city streets, and would be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else if she does not.
It doesn't keep the community safe, said Oliver Merino, co-founder of the advocacy group Comunidad Colectiva, who helped organize the resistance and campaigned independently for McFadden. Studies by the University of North Carolina's Latino Migration Project and the libertarian Cato Institute have concluded 287(g) erodes trust between immigrants and law enforcement, with little to no evidence the program reduces crime.

In Britain, a study published last year in the International Journal of Drug Policy found that 20 percent of all drugs sold at a randomly chosen 2016 festival contained substances other than the ones dealers had declared.
There were more clues: There was some healthy food in his fridge, but no stockpile of insulin. As Nicole cleaned out his cluttered blue car, littered with old prescription receipts, she started to cobble together just how much his insulin and blood sugar testing supplies cost without insurance or discounts. The total, by her count, was nearly $1,300 per month. That was roughly the same amount that Alec's local pharmacy tallied for me nearly a year later, using a list of his medications and medical supplies. It's very expensive to be diabetic without insurance, the pharmacist said. That $1,300 was almost $200 more than Alec's biweekly paycheck.
Colorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.
Others said the strategy was based on buzzwords and lacked substance. U.S. military leaders adopted an approach they labeled clear, hold and build, in which troops would clear insurgents from a district and remain until local government officials and Afghan security forces could stabilize the area with an influx of aid.

Despite the pessimistic assessment, the industry moved forward with the legislative plan.
To close the gala, McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell settle in armchairs below the giant Madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as McConnell calls it. At the appeals court level, in particular, Trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (At the district court level, however, Trump's pace lags behind that of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) My goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, McConnell says. The closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. McConnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting Trump elected. The majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: I hope you are proud of what we've done.
In addition to Blackburn, Marino and Hatch, The Post sought comment from the other nine co-sponsors of the 2016 bill. Only four responded.

Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling (Ret.) criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for being a jerk to a journalist:
Since 1992, Democrats have run elections on a twin promise of cutting middle class taxes while making the rich pay their fair share. But since the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, there's a palpable willingness among Democrats to talk about restoring higher taxes on the very wealthy, and perhaps even returning to rates abandoned decades ago. In Iowa, Warren suggested restoring the 50 percent estate tax on the very highest incomes, so that it would affect perhaps only the 10,000 wealthiest families in the country.
McConnell's stance prompted angry attacks Thursday from new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other Democrats, who insisted they were trying to give Republicans a way out of the standoff by passing two pieces of legislation: one a package of six spending bills that were negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and would reopen nearly all the federal agencies that have been shuttered since Dec. 22, and the second a stopgap spending bill through Feb. 8 covering only the Department of Homeland Security.

The numbers are real, Fauci said during an interview with NBC's Meet the Press. Go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.
Oct. 28, 2018, issue: Are you ready for Halloween? If not, French artist Jean Jullien's piece about reversing roles might get you in the spirit. I've always liked the notion of masks and costumes and [their] symbolism, Jullien says. So the idea [of the art] is just to get rid of the mask and have what's behind as the scariest thing. I also like the reversing of position and having the child show up at the monster's house. In case you were wondering, when asked if the piece has any connection to Washington or politics, Jullien said: Absolutely none.
Some, I assume, are good people, Trump said, referring to the caravans of people crossing our southern border. He might instead have added, I know that most of those trying to enter our country are good people, but some are not, and we have to make sure that drug dealers, thieves and rapists don't get through.
The comments from Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — the only Senate Republicans running for reelection in states Trump lost — pointed to cracks within the GOP that could grow as the shutdown nears the two-week mark. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reiterated Thursday that the Senate will take up only spending legislation that Trump supports.
May 5, 2019, issue: I'm a fan of the music of some of the artists accused of sexual assault, and I don't think it's possible to shut that off after learning about their alleged crimes. But now the specter of what they might have done will always be there — casting a pall over their music.
On her first Mother's Day without Alec, Nicole spent hours planting a memorial garden in a corner of her yard. A week later, on May 20, the family invited loved ones over to visit the space and commemorate Alec's first heavenly birthday. Brittany had driven a half-hour across the Wisconsin state line to buy fireworks. In the kitchen, there were hamburgers and hot dogs waiting. There was even a cake: store-bought with thick white frosting — the kind a diabetic might be told to avoid. In green letters, it read: Forever 26.
The shutdown is affecting about a quarter of the portion of the federal government funded by Congress, since the Pentagon and major agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services have already been funded through Sept. 30 by spending bills passed by Congress earlier in the year. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security also are not affected.
Tiffany Stanley is a writer in Washington.
I met Leo at the Federalist Society's offices in Washington. Despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the Trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.
Trump has been holed up in the White House instead of vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, as planned, because of the government shutdown and his standoff with Democrats over funding for a border wall.
His nomination as drug czar, which would put him in charge of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, is pending.
Prosecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. They noted that the DEA had provided conflicting guidance to Mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as Schultz.
The 2015 clip from a speech he gave at the Aspen Institute might be the starkest example. It isn't new — audio was released in real time by a reporter for the Aspen Times — but it is newly relevant. Here's what Bloomberg said:
Mario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small insurer that is a big player in both the Medicaid market and the exchanges, said that the bill does not inspire confidence.
The representatives identified three areas of attack, according to an email written by H.D. Smith Senior Vice President Tom Twitty on Dec. 12, 2013, and recently unsealed in the case.
The fact that it passed the entire Senate without hearing any sort of communication that would have triggered concern of at least one senator doesn't really pass the smell test, the spokesman said.
July 21, 2019, issue: So many of us sweat it out while confined within four walls, rather than outside, where nature can heal us. I cycle and run; for both, I just need to step out my front door. Exercising inside, on a machine, seems sacrilegious.
Testing and monitoring patients who are being evaluated for possible coronavirus infections;
July 14, 2019, issue: The playground swing — an immediate symbol of the freedom and innocence of childhood — points to the betrayal of that innocence by America's current border policy. I have to believe that if supporters of the policy spent five minutes with children in the detention centers, or in the ultraviolent communities these families are fleeing, they would see that the truth of their hardship is undeniable and sincere.
Monday, July 10, 2000 Following is the transcript of George W. Bush's speech delivered at the NAACP's 91st annual convention. BUSH: Thank you all very much. Well, Herb (ph), I'm glad they picked you. And I'm glad you introduced me. It's a great honor to be here, and I can't think of a better introducer than a fellow Texan. I'm honored to be here with Chairman Bond, President Mfume, members of the board of directors, the executive committee. I want to thank you all for your warm welcome. I've been looking forward to this, I really have, I've been looking forward to coming to tell you something. (APPLAUSE) I'm reminded--I'm reminded--I'm reminded of what the great Jackie Robinson once said when President Kennedy did something that upset him. Jackie Robinson said that he was sure the president was a fine man, but he reserved the right to change his opinion. And for those of you who support me--I see a couple here... (APPLAUSE) Maybe more than a couple. (APPLAUSE) I hope you won't change your opinion. (LAUGHTER) And for those of you who don't, I hope at least you take Jackie's position as your own and give me a chance to tell you what's on my heart. (APPLAUSE) I recognize the history of the Republican Party and the NAACP has not been one of regular partnership. But our nation is harmed when we let our differences separate us and divide us.
A few days later, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, Corruption is a cancer as dangerous to long-term success as the Taliban or al-Qaeda.
A lot of hospitals are trying to do something similar, which is get a test up and running on an instrument, get it validated in-house, Mina said. I think all of us are coming to the same realization that we can't do anything as long as this remains under the control of CDC and state labs.
After shutting down the Internet pharmacies, Rannazzisi and Barber pursued the pain management clinics that replaced them and soon became as ubiquitous in South Florida as the golden arches of McDonald's. To get there, drug dealers and users would take the Oxy Express down Interstate 75.
The president has asked for $5 billion in border money, far beyond the $1.3 billion Democrats plan to vote through this week. Trump, who tweeted his opposition to the plan Tuesday, has reiterated he had no plans to back down.
— In Maine, new Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order to move forward with expanding Medicaid in the state, fulfilling a campaign promise to make doing so her first priority, the Associated Press's Marina Villenueve reports.
Miller, who along with Busch was invited to the governor's mansion for breakfast last week to discuss bipartisanship, said the state is committed to help build and repair schools, but we don't need it to come from the casino money.
The statement, by FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals.
We will continue fighting the opioid crisis and continue to use all the tools at our disposal to combat this epidemic, the statement said.
I'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.
Rosenberg wanted to paint a new face on the DEA for the Hill, said Regina LaBelle, the chief of staff for the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy at the time. He wanted to show them the softer side of the DEA, and he wanted to work with industry.
One of the high-level champions would turn out to be Tom Marino of Pennsylvania. And one of the things he would do was to request an investigation of Rannazzisi, head of the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, by the inspector general of the Justice Department.
DEA officials redacted the information contained in the document above, which was obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act, citing an exemption from the law that protects internal agency discussions. Read the bill and other documents involved in reporting this story.
In particular, they heaped scorn on units known as the Afghan Local Police, or ALP. With about 30,000 personnel, the local police are militias organized at the village level. Although they were established in 2010 at the behest of the United States — and trained by the U.S. military — they quickly generated a reputation for brutality and drew complaints from human rights groups.
McChrystal was forced to resign in 2010 after making disparaging comments about Obama administration officials in a Rolling Stone article. He had been a rising star in the Army, a decorated expert on counterinsurgency tasked with turning around the stalemated Afghanistan war.
From a purely partisan perspective, Republican presidential candidates have won the national popular vote only once in the last 32 years, Roy wrote in his statement. They have therefore depended on the electoral college for nearly all presidential victories in the last generation. If we perpetuate the notion that Congress may disregard certified electoral votes — based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election — we will be delegitimizing the very system that led Donald Trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.
Jan. 5, 2020, issue: I loved the idea of bundling up a pet and owner in matching outfits for the inevitable trek out in the snow, since I dread going outside in the winter — and so does my dog.
