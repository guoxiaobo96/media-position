Meanwhile, Gardner said he is marshaling fellow lawmakers to oppose the new policy. A dozen senators met Tuesday in Gardner's office to talk about what we need to be doing legislatively and the direction we should be pursuing in Congress on this matter, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGardner declined to identify the senators, but he said they include Democrats and Republicans who represent states that have legalized marijuana for medical and recreational purposes and states that are considering doing so.\n\nAlthough marijuana is illegal under federal law, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing recreational consumption. Pot is legal, in some form or under some circumstances, in an additional 22 states.\n\nSessions's directive, issued last week, overturns an Obama-era policy discouraging federal enforcement in states where marijuana is legal. The attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. A survey conducted in October by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of U.S. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. Among Republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among GOP-leaning voters younger than 40.\n\nCannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. Politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.\n\nAmong Republicans, the topic is a particularly treacherous one, because it pulls at the seams of the party's coalition — pitting social conservatives against those who stand most strongly for states' rights, libertarians and fiscal hawks who see the burgeoning marijuana industry as a major source of tax revenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe attorney general is going to find out pretty quickly he's in a distinct minority, not only among the American public, but in the United States Congress, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management and author of the 2016 book Marijuana: A Short History.\n\nThis is one more headache, Hudak said, and one more issue that they do not want to be on the defensive about with the voters.\n\nMany of the places where marijuana legalization is most popular — in California, for instance, where it has just taken effect — are also areas where Republicans are struggling the hardest to hold onto House seats.\n\nAD\n\nSome insist that GOP candidates will not suffer from the new policy if they make clear that they disagree.\n\nRepublican candidates for Congress will answer that question based on what fits their district or state, said Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an evangelical political group that has campaigned against legalization.\n\nAD\n\nWill it really hurt us among young voters? It could, Reed acknowledged, but he added: You cannot ignore a federal law on the books. It breeds cynicism. It undermines respect. It undermines confidence in government itself.\n\nHow important marijuana becomes as a topic of campaign debate is likely to hinge on how Sessions's directive, issued last week, is implemented by U.S. attorneys across the country, many of whom are serving on an interim basis until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nWe now have, in what I believe is a states' rights area, 93 unelected federal officials determining state decisions, Gardner said.\n\nEarly indications are that they could head in significantly different directions, reflecting different priorities.\n\nIn Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim U.S. attorney Bob Troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.\n\nAD\n\nBut in Massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: Deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws Congress has already passed, and that I will not do.\n\nAD\n\nOregon has long had a tolerant attitude toward marijuana. It decriminalized possession of less than 1 ounce in 1973. And the newly legalized recreational pot industry brought in $85 million in tax revenue last year, said state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.\n\nWe have a growing, robust industry. You can't put that genie back in the bottle, Rosenblum said. We're not freaking out. One of the keys is a good relationship with your U.S. attorney.\n\nAD\n\nIn Oregon's case, the acting U.S. attorney, Billy J. Williams — who is awaiting Senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump sent mixed signals on the issue.\n\nHe told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. But as he was campaigning in Colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, Trump said in an interview with Denver's KUSA: I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.\n\nAD\n\nBut after Sessions announced the new policy, the White House declared that Trump was completely in agreement.\n\nThe President believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. That would be his top priority. That is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law.
They are unnecessary, unjustified, unmoored from a cost-benefit assessment, and unlikely to advance the Commission's stated goal of enhancing consumer privacy, wrote the Internet & Television Association, known as NCTA.\n\nThe petition joins a bevy of others from groups representing telecom companies, wireless carriers, tech companies and advertisers.\n\nAD\n\nThe rules, which passed by a 3-to-2 partisan vote favoring Democrats at the Federal Communications Commission in October, are meant to keep Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon and others from abusing the behavioral data they collect on customers as they regularly use the Internet.\n\nInformation such as your Web browsing history, your geolocation logs and even the content of your emails offer service providers a rich source of potential advertising revenue. That data, along with your health and financial information, can also be sold to marketers and data brokers interested in building a profile of you as a consumer. The FCC's rules restricted Internet providers' ability to use and share this information, in what privacy advocates hailed as a historic victory.\n\nAD\n\nBut now the fate of those regulations lies in question as Republicans prepare to take control of the nation's top telecom watchdog. Consumer advocacy groups vowed Wednesday to oppose the cable industry's petition.\n\nAD\n\nNothing in this election changed Americans' fundamental rights, or their need for privacy, said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press, an advocacy organization. The election only gave more power to the party that would seemingly rather side with Comcast and other cable lobbyists than with their own constituents.\n\nOpponents of the rules point out that the FCC's regulation created an imbalance in the law: While Internet providers must (for now) obey the restrictions, nothing forces Web companies such as Google and Facebook to do the same. For the past three years, the FCC under Democratic leadership has repeatedly vowed not to regulate Web companies, giving rise to complaints by telecom and cable lobbyists that the FCC was biased in their favor.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, defenders of the FCC's privacy rules argue that Internet providers are uniquely positioned to see everything a customer does with his or her connection — unlike services such as Facebook, whose understanding of user behavior is generally limited to the boundaries of its own platform.\n\nAD\n\nPolitically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. It was filed days after the departure of one Democratic commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior Democrat, Tom Wheeler, is due to step down. Both moves will leave the FCC with a two-Republican majority and a one-Democrat minority, allowing the GOP to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into the Oval Office.\n\nRepublicans at the FCC were already anticipating the opportunity last month.\n\nWe need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation, said Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai in a December speech to a conservative think tank.
Do you even need an unlimited plan?\n\nThis is the first question you'll want to answer before you grapple with the carriers' various offerings. Let's say you don't use your mobile data for very much beyond basic Web browsing and email. Or maybe the bulk of your smartphone usage happens while you're at home or at the office, where there's WiFi. Under those conditions, you might be better off signing up for a metered plan — that is, one with a monthly data cap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese plans tend to be more affordable than the typical unlimited data plan, assuming you stay within your data limits. For example, the difference in price between a 2 GB plan on Verizon and an unlimited plan on the same network is about $45 a month for a single line.\n\nExceeding your monthly cap on a metered plan could result in additional fees or reduced browsing speeds. If you find yourself blowing past your limit on a regular basis, you might consider upgrading to a larger data bucket or to an unlimited plan.\n\nTo figure out how much data you use in a month, follow these steps if you're an Android user and these instructions if you're on iOS. Spend a few weeks analyzing your habits, and some useful trends should emerge.\n\nAD\n\nUnlimited plans benefit heavy data users\n\nIf you stream lots of music or video over 3G or 4G LTE, then you may want to consider an unlimited plan. But which service to choose? Here's our side-by-side comparison of all the major carriers' offerings. We'll highlight particular points of interest below, but consider this a starting point.\n\nAs you can see, while it may be tempting simply to choose the cheapest option, there are a ton of other factors that may shape your decision.\n\nAD\n\nWhat's the catch?\n\nMany of these plans come with a trade-off of some kind or another, meaning that although they vastly expand the amount of data you're allowed to use compared with other plans, they're still not technically unlimited as their marketing may imply.\n\nAD\n\nAT&T, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, DirecTV or U-verse. It doesn't matter if you already have AT&T cellular service but not TV, or vice versa. You just need to end up with both phone and TV service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. This might not make sense if you already get your TV service through a company such as Comcast or Verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to TV. Note that DirecTV Now, AT&T's online streaming TV service, doesn't count toward this program. So if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (Update: AT&T has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of AT&T's TV services.)\n\nIf you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for T-Mobile or Sprint. Both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; Sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 Mbps and video to 480p resolution. This means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. There doesn't appear to be a way around Sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.\n\nAD\n\nT-Mobile's approach to content is a little more mixed. Customers of its unlimited plan, T-Mobile One, can choose whether to view online videos at reduced quality or at full HD resolution starting Feb. 17 for no extra charge (HD capabilities now cost an additional $15 per month per line).\n\nAD\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/831239592820871169\n\nThis offers greater flexibility, but for those who constantly stream at full HD, there are other risks to consider. Use too much data (more than 28 GB in a month) and T-Mobile may decide to slow down your connection.\n\nT-Mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 GB a month. This may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their Internet usage to a residential broadband plan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCan I share my phone's connection to a PC?\n\nIf you need to do some work on your laptop but there's no WiFi, one option is to share your phone's data connection with your PC. If this is important to you, you may want to choose Verizon or T-Mobile because they offer a lot of tethering data. Verizon's unlimited plan supports up to 10 GB of hotspot usage per month right out of the box, while T-Mobile plans to make 10 GB of monthly hotspot data available to T-Mobile One customers beginning Friday.\n\nWhat do I get if I travel a lot?\n\n\n\nIf you frequently travel to Canada or Mexico, T-Mobile arguably offers the easiest solution in its unlimited plan. Data roaming is included for those countries, and you don't have to go out of your way to add on a roaming package. You use your data just like you would in the United States. T-Mobile was also the first to liberalize its broader international roaming policies, which remain pretty competitive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat if I have a grandfathered unlimited plan?\n\nIf you signed up for an older unlimited plan years ago before companies such as AT&T and Verizon stopped selling unlimited plans, should you switch? The answer depends on what you're paying and whether some of the restrictions mentioned above are dealbreakers for you.\n\nAs an example, suppose you're paying $90 a month for a single grandfathered unlimited plan on Verizon, as this person does. (Note: This is an actual Verizon bill provided by a customer to The Washington Post. The customer provided it on the condition of anonymity to protect their personal financial information.)\n\nIt costs $39.99 a month for the phone line, plus $49.99 for the unlimited data. Because you can't have the unlimited data without the voice service, we can treat the sum as the effective cost of the unlimited plan. This person receives a few discounts here and there that appear tailored to their particular situation, so let's simply use the $90 base figure and move on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompared with the price of one of the new Verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. So switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. Because the customer used only about 7.9 GB of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to Verizon's 8 GB plan. But that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.
But the Taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands. Other factions, including breakaway Taliban groups and others claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, have footholds around the country and potentially could grow stronger without U.S.-led forces to keep them in check.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther major challenges lie ahead: Afghanistan's deepening political crisis, a controversial prisoner swap and complex intra-Afghan talks that could drag on for months or longer.\n\nEven the relative calm in Afghanistan over the past week — a precondition for the peace deal signing — was thrown into question.\n\nThe spokesman for the Taliban's Qatar office, Suhail Shaheen, told The Washington Post that the Taliban hoped for a permanent solution to violence levels. But the pledge for a week-long period of reduced violence has ended, he said.\n\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar inked the deal on an ornate desk in an opulent hall at a hotel in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony and witnessed the signing while seated across from the two men.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo called the moment historic and said the Taliban needed to live up to commitments to break with al-Qaeda and reduce violence.\n\nThe deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which U.S., Afghan and Taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. The agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue. Instead, it notes that a cease-fire would need to be agreed upon in intra-Afghan talks that are expected to start in 10 days.\n\nThe withdrawal will begin with a drawdown to 8,600 troops within 135 days, according to the document. During that time, U.S. allies and coalition members will also proportionally draw down their forces.\n\nAD\n\nTrump called the deal a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home in a statement released Friday.\n\nAD\n\nIn Kabul, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said there is real hope for peace in Afghanistan, but he warned the Taliban to meet its obligations under the deal.\n\nThe United States will not hesitate to nullify the agreement, Esper said at a ceremony with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that was held at the same time as the signing in Doha.\n\nStoltenberg called Saturday a victory for peace and noted increases in women's rights, life expectancy and respect for human rights.\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge now is to secure these gains, he said.\n\nGhani also pointed to advances made in Afghan society, including freedom of speech and the advancement of women's rights.\n\nToday can be the moment of overcoming the past, he said.\n\nBut criticism of the pact came from Trump's former White House team.\n\nAD\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton said the deal brings an unacceptable risk to America's civilian population.\n\nLegitimizing Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists, and to America's enemies generally, Bolton wrote in a tweet.\n\nUnder the deal, the Afghan government must assemble a negotiating team that will work with the Taliban to agree on the makeup of the country's new government. The peace deal stipulates that those talks must begin by March 10.\n\nGhani faces the challenge of building an inclusive negotiating team to represent the Afghans who are not aligned with the Taliban. The announcement of disputed election results earlier this month has left the government in Kabul deeply divided and has the potential to undermine Ghani's mandate to form that team.\n\nAnother potential obstacle is a planned prisoner exchange. The text of the peace deal released by the State Department said the prisoner swap — the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners in Afghan custody for about 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces in Taliban captivity — must occur by March 10 when inter-Afghan talks are set to start.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe peace deal also stated that the United States will work to remove members of the Taliban from sanctions lists and seek economic cooperation and reconstruction with the new post settlement Afghan Islamic government.\n\nFollowing the signing ceremony in Doha, Shaheen, the Taliban spokesman, told The Post that the Taliban is committed to the deal, but that doesn't mean violence levels will remain low in Afghanistan.\n\nThat was for making the environment conducive to sign the deal, Shaheen said. The Taliban hopes to achieve a permanent solution to violence levels in Afghanistan, but right now [there is] no such understanding of a cease-fire or reduction in violence.\n\nShaheen also suggested there may be some gray area in the Taliban's commitment not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil to plan and launch attacks against the United States and its allies.\n\nA peace deal with the Taliban has been a critical foreign policy goal for Trump, who campaigned on ending the war. But he has faced fierce criticism from the Afghan government as well as from fellow Republicans at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfghan officials have repeatedly criticized the United States for excluding them from talks with the Taliban. Any significant withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country is expected to place increased pressure on Afghan government forces, whose casualty rates continue to rise.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican lawmakers released a letter warning that the Taliban has a history of extracting concessions in exchange for false assurances.\n\nA full-scale U.S. withdrawal would allow terrorist groups in Afghanistan to grow stronger and establish safe havens from which to plot attacks against us, the letter continued.\n\nTrump's Friday statement said ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. and Taliban negotiators were close to signing a peace deal in September, but the effort was scuttled by Trump after an attack by the Taliban killed a U.S. soldier.\n\nSince then, Khalilzad has sought confidence-building measures to bring both sides back to the table. In November, the Taliban released two Western hostages in exchange for the release of senior militants linked to the Taliban by the Afghan government. And over the last week, both sides reduced violence nationwide.\n\nIt is unclear if the reduction in violence will hold in the coming weeks as Afghan government officials and the Taliban begin talks. The Afghan government initially demanded a cease-fire before agreeing to talks with the Taliban.\n\nAs peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban gained momentum last year, violence in Afghanistan intensified. The United Nations' annual report on civilian casualties released this month said 3,403 civilians were killed and 6,989 were injured in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has documented more than 100,000 civilian casualties since the organization began its tally in 2009.

Wonder Woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. But while it's a pretty bad DC Comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes DC Comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid Washington, D.C. movie. Given Hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see WW84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the District and its residents can be.\n\nThe bad first: WW84 is scattershot and nonsensical, seemingly designed solely around a desire to get pilot Steve Trevor, who died in the first film, back for a second go-round, even if that means negating his heroic sacrifice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, writers Patty Jenkins (who also directed) and Geoff Johns introduce Maxwell Lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. Where previous entries in the DC expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and Wonder Woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane You can't always get what you want or Be careful what you wish for.\n\nAll of this would be fine if the action sequences were any good; sadly, they are not. Perhaps it's just a function of watching this at home via HBO Max, as most people will, but everything on screen felt cheap and bland. There's nothing as exciting as the German assault on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira or her march through a World War I No Man's Land in the first film; everything is weightless and silly.\n\nStill, it's not all bad, and Wonder Woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. Unlike many Hollywood productions, the movie uses actual D.C. locations for both interior and exterior shots. Watching Wonder Woman stride through the iconic Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's entry and take a resurrected Steve on a tour of D.C.'s Metro system gave the picture a genuine Washington flair so often absent from movies like this. Big setpieces that take place on actual Washington streets in sight of the Capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the Watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the Reflecting Pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis fealty to D.C. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a Silver Line (or a Green Line!) in 1984, a pass. And it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get Toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for D.C.: WW84 joins Breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of D.C. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.\n\nMore than that, though, WW84 nails the mood of a certain sort of D.C. resident who believes that earning an internship in the White House would be enough to give a gangly young dork the gumption to ask a literal Amazon goddess out on a date.\n\nIndeed, in its treatment of folks around town — from the mousy-but-competent workers such as Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) who get lost in the bureaucracy that employs them to the full-of-themselves donors and interns who operate the shadow economy that keeps D.C.'s institutions running — WW84 has a lot in common with Shattered Glass, Billy Ray's movie about the fabulist Stephen Glass, who almost took down the New Republic. That movie captured the sociology of D.C., with its weird mélange of poor pay, idealism and naked ambition in the service of jockeying for social position, in a way that few others have managed. Like that movie, WW84 shows how Washington's institutions and mores leave it at risk of being corrupted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — Ronald Reagan, the architect of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, would have been unlikely to use Maxwell Lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. I will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of Israel Defense Forces vet Gadot taking apart the Egyptian King of Crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 won't top my Washington DC Area Film Critics Association nominations for best picture. But I'd be shocked if it didn't win the group's Joe Barber Award for Best Portrayal of Washington, D.C. More movies that purport to care about the capital and what happens here should take note.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD
Online purchasing is a potential lifeline for SNAP participants living in urban neighborhoods and rural communities where access to healthy food choices can be limited, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a news release last week.\n\nThe program will be tested in seven states, including Maryland. The USDA has partnered with several local and national retailers for the two-year pilot, including Hy-Vee and FreshDirect. In Maryland, SNAP recipients will be able to choose among Amazon, Safeway and ShopRite. Participants will be able to use SNAP to pay for eligible items, but delivery charges will come out of their own pockets. Bread, meat, fruits and vegetables are permitted; household items, beer and cigarettes are among the prohibited goods. (Disclosure: Amazon and The Washington Post share an owner.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program also stands to improve the lives of SNAP recipients who do not have cars and who may have to walk miles to a grocery store. And while come critics of the program might wonder about recipients' access to the Internet, Wonkblog's Rachel Premack reported in July that connectivity is less of a problem than transportation:\n\nAccess to at-home Internet is somewhat more common among the poor than access to a car — 88 percent vs. 79.6 percent . Take Mobile, Ala., where a third of residents are both below poverty level and live farther than half a mile from the nearest supermarket. Ninety-one percent of those below the poverty line have Internet access, and only 76 percent have a car. The option of home-delivered groceries, assuming the Internet access is fast enough to use the websites of grocery providers, could make life less stressful.\n\nPoor families might also choose to shop online for the same reason middle-class families do: They'll get extra time to spend at work or with their families, instead of shopping at a brick-and-mortar store. On the most basic level, time spent with children is a luxury low-income parents often cannot afford, Clio Chang wrote in a report for the Century Foundation. Emotional neglect can adversely affect childhood development.\n\nTo prevent fraud, SNAP purchases must have a higher level of security than other online purchases, the news release notes. The most recent statistics on stamp trafficking, one form of food stamp fraud, peg it at 1.3 percent nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSNAP grew significantly after the recession, but the number of caseloads has declined in recent years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than 44 million Americans benefit from the program; nearly half are children. Another push for access in 2013 expanded SNAP acceptance at farmers markets nationwide.
There is public interest value in the preservation of those stories, said Alex Howard, a government transparency advocate who previously served as deputy director of the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, has been one of the most prominent users of Instagram Stories. She's offered voters everything from videos of herself preparing Instant Pot macaroni and cheese to a behind-the-scenes look at her time on the Hill. Just yesterday she used it to respond to a CBS News 60 Minutes piece about her.\n\nAnd ephemeral messaging is only becoming more prevalent in the run-up to the 2020 campaign: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, cracked open a beer in her Instagram Story last week after announcing her presidential bid. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who's weighing a 2020 run, was a frequent Instagram Stories user during his 2018 campaign for senator, showing personal moments even after he lost of himself eating guacamole while driving.\n\nBut these Stories no longer exist on their Instagram accounts — and Howard says the public shouldn't have to simply rely on journalists or other observers to screenshot them for posterity. Ocasio-Cortez's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on her use of social media or whether they were archiving the ephemeral stories in any way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a stark contrast from federal agencies and the White House, which must comply with strict record-keeping rules, members of Congress have broad discretion over what they archive.\n\nHoward thinks it's time for new record-keeping rules, including ones account for social media and disappearing posts. Though much of the data created by congressional committees and administrative officers is considered official records and archived, individual members can decide what to do with papers and content created by their own offices. It's considered their personal property, and they can determine what they want to preserve. There's lots of reasons that politicians choose not to have things be archived, Howard says.\n\nCompare that to how the executive branch has handled social media. The Presidential Records Act, which went into effect in 1978, mandated that all official presidential records belong to the public. Presidents have kept this law in mind even when using new technologies. For instance, when the White House joined Snapchat in 2016, a senior Obama White House official told BuzzFeed that it would fully comply with those requirements, saving and preserving Snaps for archives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the short-term, Howard would like to see technology companies step up and create archives of photos and videos that verified politicians post to their accounts. He wants journalists and researchers to be able to access these posts, even if the politicians themselves are not preserving them. He said the archives could be similar to those that some technology companies have set up under intense political pressure to allow third parties to review political ads purchased on their platforms.\n\nThat would be the patch, Howard said. [The companies] created a bug in our democratic system of accountability.\n\nRight now politicians largely use this new form of social media to highlight light moments and seem more down-to-earth to voters, but some are worried about the impact this technology could have when it is used for more important policy announcements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Xiao Mina, the author of the upcoming book Memes to Movements, said in a tweet that the posts might seem innocuous because they are interesting selfie videos of cooking meals and attending orientation. But she warned disappearing posts could present problems as people try to document and understand the rise of political leaders:\n\nHoward said on Sunday that Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's use of Instagram Stories put a fine point on the fact that the trend has extended beyond U.S. politicians:\n\nThe controversy over Instagram Stories highlights the challenge for technology companies as the tools they created to connect friends are increasingly being used for political messaging — perhaps with consequences they never intended.\n\nAD\n\nIt is one of the idiosyncrasies of this moment that we are in where private companies are hosting public squares, Howard said.\n\nAD\n\nBITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES\n\nBITS: The big Apple news at this year's CES technology show will be the company's woes in China — a stark departure from the role the company's gadgets typically play in driving news at the annual Las Vegas trade show, Bloomberg News's Selina Wang and Mark Gurman report. It's going to be the elephant in the room at CES, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News. This has been dark days for Apple and for the tech industry. I think there's a lot of questions in regards to the smartphone industry going forward, especially with what Apple said about with demand in China.\n\nApple's warning that its sales would fall short last week has contributed to fears about an economic slowdown and the overall stability of the technology sector. Apple is set to encounter multiple hurdles in China this year amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing as well as increasing competition from local rivals, Reuters's Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis reported. Apple also faces a preliminary injunction by a Chinese court banning sales of several iPhone models, but the ban has not been enforced yet. Apple is not expected to roll out a 5G phone in China before next year, which would place it behind competitors including Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung, Reuters also reported.\n\nThe iPhone XR in particular struggles to convince Chinese consumers, as the Wall Street Journal's Yoko Kubota noted. The XR hasn't sold as expected in China because it is being passed over by both price-conscious buyers and status seekers, analysts say, Kubota wrote. Some Chinese consumers have perceived the sticker price of 6,499 yuan, or about $945, to be too expensive even though it is at least 25% cheaper than the higher-end iPhone XS and XS Max models.\n\nNIBBLES: Democratic operatives and a research firm who played a role in an online effort to influence a 2017 U.S. Senate race in Alabama to help elect Democrat Doug Jones are distancing themselves from the initiative's most controversial tactics that were inspired by Russian disinformation, according to The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe operation, called Project Birmingham, used tactics such as a false flag effort to create bogus evidence that Russian bots supported Jones's Republican opponent Roy Moore on Twitter, according to a 12-page document obtained by The Post. Another component of Project Birmingham was the creation of a deceitful Facebook page targeting conservative voters in Alabama and aiming to hamper Moore's campaign.\n\nIn a second online effort against Moore, progressive Democratic operatives posed as conservatives on Facebook and Twitter and claimed to be part of a Dry Alabama movement that supported the Republican candidate, according to the New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder. The Times reported that the Democratic operatives thought associating Mr. Moore with calls for a statewide alcohol ban would hurt him with moderate, business-oriented Republicans and help Jones.\n\nBYTES: Ford is set to start testing self-driving vehicles in the nation's capital early this year, and officials in Washington and other cities are working to anticipate how technological changes in transportation will affect their communities, according to The Post's Michael Laris. D.C. and other cities partnered with the Aspen Institute and Bloomberg Philanthropies to set common goals for developers of driverless cars. High on the list of priorities is cutting greenhouse gases and other pollution, eliminating congestion and ensuring that officials have the opportunity to adapt as changes barrel ahead, Michael wrote. The initiative also includes Los Angeles, Austin, London, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and other cities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen we think about the future of our city, we see less single-occupancy vehicle trips, more vehicle electrification and an emphasis on building the infrastructure and policy framework to support those goals, Jeff Marootian, director of the District Department of Transportation, told my colleague. For instance, the city added electric buses to its Circulator fleet and has started a push to convert more than 75,000 streetlights into LEDs that save energy, according to Marootian.\n\nPRIVATE CLOUD\n\n-- The Internet and Television Association (known as NCTA), Cable Labs and Cable Europe talked exclusively with me about their plans for 10G broadband networks, an initiative they plan to unveil at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.\n\nSuch a network would be about ten times as fast as the current speeds available to most consumers today, NCTA President Michael Powell tells me. Lab trials of the technology are already underway, and they expect field trials to begin in 2020. He says broadband at these speeds could enable a host of new technologies, by enabling better video streaming or making it easier to use connected home devices. Both trends are expected to be in the spotlight this week at the annual trade show.\n\nIt's more than just watching 'House of Cards,' Powell said. He's hoping faster broadband speeds will enable innovations in fields like healthcare, where the technology could enable new ways to process medical images and videos. Powell's comments come as 5G , the fifth generation of cell networks technology, is setting the agenda at CES. Powell tells me every evolution in the mobile networks needs to be met with new technology in broadband networks. The country critically needs both, Powell said.\n\n— In a report exploring JPMorgan Chase's relationship with Amazon, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer, Laura Stevens and AnnaMaria Andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos established at the online retail giant. Mr. Bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep Amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and FAQs, according to the Journal. Over roughly the past 18 months, JPMorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under Gordon Smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [JPMorgan] employees said. JPMorgan has also embraced Bezos's Customer Obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the Journal.

Netflix confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through iTunes. Instead, subscribers are being redirected to make payments on Netflix's own website, my colleague reported.\n\n— More technology news from the private sector:\n\nPUBLIC CLOUD\n\n— Tesla wants the Trump administration to spare the Model 3's Chinese-made computer brain from tariffs, according to Reuters's David Shepardson. The 25 percent tariffs enacted in August are hurting the company's profitability, according to Tesla. Increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability, Tesla said in a request to the government for tariff exemption, as Shepardson reported. The company also said in the request that it has not been able to find another supplier with the required specifications, at the volume requested and under the timelines necessary for Tesla's continued growth.\n\n— More technology news from the public sector:\n\nFAST FWD\n\n— Four of the nine scheduled keynote speakers at CES this year are women, a sign that the event's organizers are starting to promote gender equity at the technology show, the Associated Press's Barbara Ortutay reported. The activist group GenderAvenger recently gave CES a Gold Stamp of Approval for the show's lineup. The group said the keynote and featured speakers include 45 percent of women, 60 percent of whom are women of color.\n\nBut really leveling the playing field often means more than inviting female CEOs to speak, Ortutay wrote. For starters, women and people of color are underrepresented in the tech industry, especially in leadership and technical roles. So, conference organizers might need to look harder, or be more flexible in who they invite to speak.\n\n#TRENDING\n\n404 ERROR\n\n— Huawei punished two employees for wishing people a happy new year via the company's Twitter account with an iPhone, according to Reuters's Sijia Jiang.

DICKERSON: When I talked to Republicans on the Hill, they wonder, what in the White House -- what have you all learned from this experience with the executive order?\n\nMILLER: Well, I think that it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, John, the idea that you have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before.\n\nThe end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
Stocks surged after Powell's remarks, with the Dow Jones industrial average leaping more than 600 points in late-morning trading. The Fed has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but Wall Street traders and Trump don't want any. Powell's comments indicate the Fed might be revising its views.\n\nAD\n\nWith the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said during a panel discussion at the American Economic Association annual meeting alongside former Fed chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke. We're always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Powell of raising interest rates so fast that it's hurting the economy, but the Fed argues that the economy is expanding faster than normal and no longer needs low rates to stimulate growth.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the central bank raised interest rates in December, Trump asked advisers if it's possible to fire Powell, an unprecedented move that many think isn't legally possible since a Fed governor can only be removed for cause.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked Friday if he would step down if Trump asked, Powell said simply, no.\n\nThe president picked Powell for the Fed's top job in late 2017 but has quickly soured on him after the Fed raised interest rates a full percentage point last year, an action that can slow the economy. Several of Trump's top aides have said publicly that the president can't fire Powell because Fed appointees can only be removed for cause, which courts have interpreted as criminal activity.\n\nThe Fed chair said that he hasn't spoken with Trump, although Powell indicated he would be willing to meet with the president. I can't think of any Fed chairs who didn't eventually meet with the president, Powell said while seated alongside Yellen and Bernanke.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLarry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, said he thinks a meeting between Trump and Powell will happen and that it will help both sides to talk through their differences. But Kudlow and Powell said no meeting has been scheduled yet.\n\nIt would be nice to have a frank and a candid exchange up close and personal, Kudlow said Friday morning in an interview on Bloomberg TV. President Trump would benefit. I think Jay Powell would benefit.\n\nPowell vowed repeatedly Friday that the central bank would be flexible as it decides whether to continue raising interest rates in 2019. Yellen supported the strategy, saying the Fed is in a good position to maintain that flexibility.\n\nAD\n\nAll three said the U.S. economy would grow at a slower rate this year than last but that they saw little sign of a recession.\n\nAD\n\nIt's likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018, Bernanke said. This is not something that is news. We've anticipated this for a long time because it was clear the stimulus would be dying down over time.\n\nYellen added that growth is still likely to end up being above the growth rate of potential, which is consistent with a strong labor market and maybe even some further tightening.\n\nThe Fed recently cut its forecast for growth in 2019 to 2.3 percent (down from 2.5 percent) as concerns grow about the stock market correction and the slowdown in China and Europe dragging down the U.S. economy. But Fed leaders still insist that is above trend and very healthy growth.\n\nAD\n\nUnemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now. We have inflation under control. I think that's a pretty good outcome, and we sure think it can continue, Powell said, adding that he feels fine about capital markets.\n\nAD\n\nPowell's optimism was bolstered Friday when the Labor Department announced the economy added 312,000 jobs in December, blowing out expectations and capping the best year of job growth since 2015.\n\nIf the U.S. economy keeps growing through July, this will be the longest expansion in U.S. history. Bernanke predicted the economy would achieve this milestone and that people shouldn't fear an immediate downturn just because the nation has never experienced economic growth for this long.\n\nExpansions don't die of old age. I like to say they get murdered, Bernanke said.
Soon after he made his announcement at 2 p.m. during a Senate floor speech, the criticism came rolling in fast and furious as he drew denunciations from senior campaign officials, the president's family members, fellow GOP senators and his own niece.\n\nMitt should be expelled from the @SenateGOP conference. #expelMitt, Donald Trump Jr., wrote on Twitter before logging onto Instagram to mock Romney for wearing mom jeans.\n\nAD\n\nOnly the President's political opponents — all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate — voted for the manufactured impeachment articles, said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who worked for Romney's presidential campaign in 2012.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Romney's niece, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, offered him no quarter.\n\nThis is not the first time I've disagreed with Mitt, and I imagine it will not be the last, she said in statement. The bottom line is President Trump did nothing wrong, and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him. I, along with the GOP, stand with President Trump.\n\nWhether the thirst for vengeance against Romney is sustained will hinge on Trump, who has long smarted from the Utah Republican's criticism of him and takes pride in hitting back at perceived and real enemies.\n\nAD\n\nParty and campaign officials said privately that they hoped Trump wouldn't obsess over the lone defection and move on from impeachment, basking in his acquittal instead of engaging in a days-long tiff with Romney. The president has firm control of the party and could dictate a strategy that is more aggressive, advisers said, if his pique at Romney flares.\n\nAD\n\nTrump told advisers in recent weeks that he was more worried about Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) than Romney, according to people who heard his comments. In the end, Collins and Murkowski voted with the president.\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak about the Senate vote to acquit him of the two House impeachment charges at the White House on Thursday — an event that will serve as an indication whether he's ready to move on from Romney's vote or try to make him another of example of what happens to Republicans who cross him.\n\nAD\n\nRomney said he couldn't let concerns over breaking with his party guide his vote, which he cast as one of conscience and rooted in his religious beliefs.\n\nI am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced, Romney said on the Senate floor. I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nAD\n\nThe senator said he had not slept past 4 a.m. since the Senate impeachment trial began last month, wrestling over how he should vote, and eventually decided to buck the president because he saw the evidence that Trump pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals as overwhelming.\n\nAD\n\nRomney told The Washington Post that he asked the White House for more information about actions taken toward Ukraine, particularly concerning acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but none was provided. He wanted former national security adviser John Bolton to testify, which he said could have potentially raised reasonable doubt that the president did anything wrong and lead him to vote to acquit. The Senate rejected subpoenaing Bolton.\n\nRepublican and campaign officials said among the steps that could be taken to punish Romney are continued attacks on Twitter or through paid advertisements. Trump allies could also help fund an opponent in his state, although he's not up for reelection until 2024, or push operatives or donors not to support or work for him. White House officials could block policy or budget priorities that Romney wants, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\nAD\n\nA senior Trump campaign official said the longer the Romney news cycle drags on, the worse it is for the president, because it focuses attention on his impeachment. Advisers were encouraging Trump to not dignify Romney's vote with a response, and there were no immediate plans to campaign against Romney.\n\nAD\n\nIrrelevant relic, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nLittle punch. Move on. It's over, one senior campaign official said, to describe the strategy. We were already done with him.\n\nRomney's colleagues are highly unlikely to kick him out of the Senate Republican conference, but the president's allies could push for such a move and make life uncomfortable for Romney and his colleagues. While several senators criticized Romney's vote, many were quick to oppose giving him the boot.\n\nAD\n\nI'm glad Mitt is a Republican, said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he was surprised and disappointed with Romney's vote but said the Utah Republican was largely supportive of the president.\n\nAD\n\nWe don't have any doghouses here. The most important vote is the next vote, he said.\n\nMcDaniel issued the statement quickly to make clear whose side she was on and to get ahead of potential stories that were likely to question her loyalty to the president if she remained silent, a Republican official said. She did not receive a heads-up from her uncle and the president did not ask her to put out a statement, according to the official.\n\nThe White House did not receive an advance notice of Romney's decision, though some aides were preparing for the idea that he would go against the president.\n\nAD\n\nNeither Trump nor White House staff lobbied Romney, according to aides. It wouldn't have helped, said one senior White House aide directly involved in the impeachment process.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Trump takes particular pride in Republicans sticking with him, regularly peppering aides with questions about any Republican defections on legislation. During impeachment, he repeatedly told advisers that he wanted a bipartisan acquittal — hoping to get at least one Democrat to vote with him, and for Republicans to stick together.\n\nNo Democrats voted to acquit the president, leaving Romney as the only senator to break with his party.\n\nThe president spent much of a weekend in early October attacking Romney on Twitter, but advisers said that was largely designed to telegraph to other Republicans that they should not buck the president.\n\nAD\n\nParty officials said they did not give instructions for anyone to call for Romney's expulsion from the party, but one Republican fundraiser said that donors who once supported Romney are now solidly behind Trump. As the Republican Party noted in its release attacking Romney, the president is more popular than the senator in Utah.\n\nAD\n\nI suspect that donors and operatives are not going to be allowed to play both sides of the field. They are going to have to choose, said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr. He is going to be considered a pariah moving forward.\n\nTrump has complained that he endorsed Romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for Senate and that Romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the Senate in early 2019. Trump met with Romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAides note Romney was at the White House twice in November, including for a lengthy meeting on vaping in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nDuring a November Oval Office meeting with political advisers, some suggested attacking Romney but Trump told them to hold off, hoping he would stick with Republicans on impeachment.\n\nPeople close to Romney say he knows where he currently stands in the Republican Party — on an island — but will not be cowed by Trump's attacks. While he agrees with Trump regularly on policy, his advisers said he sees standing up against some of Trump's behavior as a moral imperative.\n\nHe's not someone who operates from a center of fear. I don't think it had anything to do with his decision, said Stuart Stevens, a former adviser to Romney and a critic of Trump. He tried to look at this as if, what would he do if a Democrat was in office? He wanted to be a true juror. He took it very seriously. I think Mitt Romney will sleep very well tonight.\n\nBrendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said Romney would get attacked repeatedly just as Ryan did when he occasionally criticized the president.
The Afghan war in particular could become a key campaign issue in the upcoming presidential cycle after a decade on the sidelines, and liberal Democrats in the House may have more leeway to raise objections to U.S. military involvement under Democratic leadership.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Warren took issue with the president's style but not his position that the United States should bow out of what she called endless wars.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign Feb. 9, more than a month after announcing her exploratory committee. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nI think it is right to get our troops out of Syria — and, let me add, I think it's right to get our troops out of Afghanistan, Warren said.\n\nThe position is further than other potential 2020 candidates have gone so far, but could open the door for other Democrats calling for a reconsideration of the U.S. mandate in Afghanistan.\n\nPotential 2020 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Afghanistan an unwinnable war in 2008 and as a presidential candidate in 2016 said he opposed continuation of the Afghan occupation.\n\nAD\n\nJoe Biden, who has the most foreign policy experience among frequently mentioned potential 2020 Democrats, opposed the large-scale troop surge when he served as Barack Obama's vice president. He favored a smaller counterterrorism force.\n\nWarren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told interviewer Rachel Maddow that after 17 years of war there remain lots of different problems in Afghanistan, and what seems to be the answer from the foreign policy establishment? 'Stay forever.' That is not a policy. We can't do that.\n\nAD\n\nWarren, like other Democrats and some Republicans, took issue with Trump's abrupt announcement via Twitter last month that he would immediately close out the troop commitment in Syria. Roughly 2,000 U.S. forces are there under a limited mandate authorized by Obama in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement, in which Trump declared that the Islamic State had been defeated, prompted the resignation of retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis as defense secretary and the resignation of the lead U.S. envoy to the coalition fighting the militant group.\n\nYou can talk about our generals. I gave our generals all the money they wanted. They didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan, Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that was open to reporters. They've been fighting in Afghanistan for 19 years.\n\nObama had approved an enormous expansion of the Afghan war during his first term in office — a surge bringing military gains that have now been substantially reversed. Obama also was unable to end the Iraq War as he had hoped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who visited troops in Iraq last month in his first trip to a war zone, has said he supports the continuation of that mission. But he has ordered the gradual departure of about half the approximately 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe merits of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria were a back-burner issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine's long-running effort to force a reconsideration of the George W. Bush-era war authorization.\n\nKaine annoyed some in the Obama White House by pushing for Senate review of the 2001 military authorization, and he argues that congressional oversight is even more essential now. Like other Democrats, however, he takes issue with Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.\n\nAD\n\nI don't trust President Trump's ability to keep us safe by himself, and I'm very concerned that he's making decisions that go against military advice, without consulting Congress or our allies, Kaine said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nIn the House, antiwar Democrat Rep. Barbara Lee of California will continue her efforts to repeal the 2001 military authorization she said has now been used or misused in more than two dozen instances far afield from the original invasion of Afghanistan that it covered. She was the lone member of Congress to vote against the authorization, days after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAD\n\nI've always considered this a top-priority issue, Lee said in an interview. It's a blank check to use force anywhere in the world.\n\nAD\n\nLee would not on speculate whether a majority of her colleagues would support a renewal of that authorization now. But congressional leaders of both parties have long avoided the question in large part out of concern that a no vote would undermine the president and existing military missions.\n\nThe public deserve to understand the costs and consequences of war, Lee said. Congress has been missing in action.\n\nLee may get new support from liberal antiwar Democrats who took their seats on Thursday, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. During her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez said she probably would not have voted in favor of any of the troop commitments approved since the start of the Afghan war, although she voiced some support for Obama's rationale that his troop increase was an attempt to deal with this mess of going into Afghanistan in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Afghan war has not been a major focus for new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and it is not clear whether she has much appetite for a major debate on the U.S. commitment there.\n\nPelosi led a congressional delegation to Afghanistan in March last year. Our meetings confirmed that Afghanistan has come a long way with the support of the U.S. and other international partners but formidable challenges remain, she said at the time.\n\nDan Feldman, who served as Obama's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, supports the current Trump administration efforts to foster peace talks with the Taliban and said Trump undercut that effort by demanding an arbitrary drawdown.\n\nAD\n\nBut Feldman is not surprised that some Democrats align with Trump's larger point on ending conflicts.

Several of them abused pain medications.\n\nI was not a user, so they would ask me if I'd turn them in. My typical response: Do what you want to do, but if I catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, I'll make sure you never work here again.\n\n(Monica Akhtar,Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nMy attitude did not change after I began working in a mine closer to home just outside Clintwood, Va. The company I worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. But the problem was still apparent. We would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.\n\nSome may judge me for not turning people in. But before I rushed to judgment, I considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.\n\nCoal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.\n\nMany of those I worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. They had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. Those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. In many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.\n\nMine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. Few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. Even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.\n\nIn Clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. It is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. The only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. Again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.\n\nIf a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. It is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.\n\nWith recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into Appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. Not only has Wall Street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.\n\nOver the past three decades, I have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. If we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal.
Playing on his nickname, the Observer newspaper in England once dubbed him The Sundance Kid of the Caribbean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was a considered a White Jamaican with European roots, but he was born and bred on the island and retained his Caribbean accent. As well as his resorts, he founded the daily Jamaica Observer to compete with the island's oldest newspaper, the Gleaner (launched in 1834).\n\nLeading a group of investors, he also bought the national airline Air Jamaica in 1994, expanding its routes beyond the Caribbean to destinations including the United States and the United Kingdom. The airline continued to lose money, however, and after Mr. Stewart and his group pulled out in 2004, it bounced between state and private control until it went out of business in 2015.\n\nHe twice put his money where his mouth was for Jamaica when its foreign currency holdings were low and democratic socialism was on the rise: First in the 1970s and '80s when he realized the island had to build tourism hotels. Then, in 1992, when the economy was threatened by currency speculators, he pumped $30 million of his own money into Jamaican banks to keep them afloat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Stewart, 79, died Jan. 4 in Miami, according to his son Adam Stewart, who now takes over the Sandals Resorts International empire and who did not give a specific cause of death. He did say that his father had received a recent medical diagnosis but had kept it quiet so as not to worry his friends or workers. In May last year he had donated $31.5 million to Jamaican authorities to help families suffering from the coronavirus.\n\nGordon Arthur Cyril Stewart was born in the Jamaican capital Kingston on July 6, 1941. His father had been brought to Jamaica from England as a baby and became a radio maintenance technician at the state-run Jamaica Broadcasting Corp., while his mother ran an appliance dealership.\n\nHe first went to school at Campion Hall Jesuit preparatory school in Kingston, where a priest once dubbed him the most unlikely to succeed in life, and later in the parish of St. Ann on Jamaica's north coast. He was sent to England to complete his education at a school in London.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy 10, he was obsessed by the sea and soon began to find any ways to make money. From a tree trunk, he built himself a dugout canoe; later he bought a bigger boat, caught fish and sold it to local hotels. He also learned he could make decent bucks by taking wealthy visitors from their yachts to shore and back.\n\nAccording to his friend, Jamaica Observer founding editor Desmond Allen, he once took glamorous British actress Joan Collins to a secluded reef where she proceeded to have a nude dip. He was still a boy, and she did not invite him to join her. (He could only have dreamed then that he would one day own his own 132-foot, $5 million yacht, the Lady Sandals, on which he sailed until shortly before his death.)\n\nHe was in his early 20s when he saw a moneymaking opportunity while the first James Bond film Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, was being shot in Jamaica. He borrowed his father's motorboat to take Connery and the film crew to location sites, including a shipwreck. He was also of a mechanical bent and bought dilapidated cars, spruced them up and sold them for a healthy profit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter his spell at school in London, he returned to Jamaica and soon became a successful sales manager for the Dutch-owned Curacao Trading Co. In 1968, he set up his own company, Appliance Traders Ltd., to sell air-conditioning units, fridges and freezers, and it remains the parent company to Sandal Resorts International.\n\nHis son Jonathan died in a car accident in 1989, and Mr. Stewart said he plunged into a months-long depression. Survivors include his third wife, Cheryl, and seven children from his three marriages; his mother; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. Stewart ran into serious controversy in the 1990s when, with the gay rights movement blossoming, he was attacked for his no-gay policy at Sandals resorts. The initial policy, from 1981, was that Sandals resorts, starting with the first one at Montego Bay, would be for couples (heterosexuals) only. At the time, homosexuality was still illegal in Jamaica.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Stewart eventually caught up with the times and abolished the policy in 2004, and the Sandals resorts have continued to prosper. He created the Beaches resorts for families, also a major success.\n\nThe anti-gay policy damaged him abroad but not in Jamaica, where he often strolled (without bodyguard) around Kingston to shouts of Mornin', Butch! In his office one morning in 1996, while he lounged in a beige armchair wearing his trademark Harrods of London striped shirt — no tie — and with one foot on a glass coffee table, he was asked by a journalist for the London Independent: What are you worth?\n\nI don't have any money. I sank it all into this, he replied, indicating a model of an Air Jamaica jetliner. We come out of a culture that says everything that happens has to be done by the government. More and more people are realizing you've got to do it on your own.
Beginning in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order denying work to those suspected of sexual perversion, thousands of gay men and women were forced out of the federal bureaucracy. While the exact number of victims claimed by this lavender scare is difficult to quantify, one scholar estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people were affected, far exceeding those expelled in the simultaneous (not to mention much more extensively documented and remembered) red scare.\n\nMany gay and lesbian workers quietly resigned rather than face humiliating security interrogations, others committed suicide without leaving an explanation, and untold numbers never even applied for jobs due to the prohibition on their employment. It was not until 1995, when President Bill Clinton signed an executive order reversing the Eisenhower measure, that sexual orientation was removed from the list of conditions justifying the denial of a security clearance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the Cold War was twofold. The first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. Because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. So shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.\n\nThe genesis for this belief lay in the career of Col. Alfred Redl. A gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the Austro-Hungarian army, Redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to Russia in 1913. Redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his Russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late Belle Époque Vienna. However, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that Redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the Russians over it.\n\nThe revelation of Redl's treason just before the outbreak of World War I inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. Over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. Five decades after Redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the Austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of Washington politics Advise and Consent, later made into a hit film directed by Otto Preminger. The book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. Although Advise and Consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.\n\nFears about gay Americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the Cold War. Previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. In 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. Nonetheless, Hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. Hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of Congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.\n\nHillenkoetter alluded to a case that year involving a Soviet intelligence operation wherein our task will be made considerably easier by the appearance in the area of a known homosexual who we think will be extremely helpful in this particular case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the Cold War inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. The specter of a Homosexual International, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful Communist one. A series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.\n\nIn 1948, Time magazine journalist Whittaker Chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, was a member of his cell. While Chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, Hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.\n\nLikewise, when British diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean defected to the Soviet Union in 1951, and two National Security Agency cryptologists, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, fled to Moscow in 1960, many attributed their defections to deviant sexualities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Burgess was openly gay and Mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. Nonetheless, pressure from the FBI over the Burgess affair led the British government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the Foreign Service, and media portrayed Martin and Mitchell as lovers.\n\nThe sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay Americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. Never in American history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. The more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist Joe Alsop in 1957. When the KGB entrapped him having sex with another man in a Moscow hotel room, Alsop marched straight to the American Embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. Years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across Washington, Alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the Soviet regime.\n\nMoreover, it never seemed to cross the minds of intelligence professionals like Roscoe Hillenkoetter or the senators questioning him that a gay person was by necessity someone skilled at keeping secrets in a homophobic society and therefore might actually be predisposed for espionage work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 1969 Stonewall uprising against police harassment at a Greenwich Village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. But a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in Washington, D.C., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights.
Republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as House speaker, despite dissent.\n\nWhy do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? Parties make a critical trade-off. They empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. But those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.\n\nThis is what my research shows\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. I support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.\n\nParties face a dilemma when writing rules. If the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the Rules Committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. But if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.\n\nSince the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. A variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow does Pelosi maintain power?\n\nHouse chamber and Democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the House. Since the November elections, Pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. That included creating a leadership position for Rep. Barbara Lee; reviving the House administration subcommittee on elections for Rep. Marcia L. Fudge to chair; and promising the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group within the House that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.\n\nPelosi's entrenchment echoes that of Boehner (2011-2015): The Ohio Republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every GOP House member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be sure, Boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. He ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. Still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly Boehner neutralized potential rivals.\n\nPast partisans often preferred weaker leaders\n\nParties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. Throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. As a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.\n\nAD\n\nOnly the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers Nicholas Longworth (R), 1925-1931, and Sam Rayburn (D), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. Party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. With leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as Charles Halleck (R), 1959-1965; Frederick Gillett (R) 1919-1925; and John McCormack (D) 1962-1971.\n\nAD\n\nThis system had serious shortcomings. When party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the House struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. For example, McCormack failed to pass most of the Kennedy legislative program in the 87th Congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large Democratic majority.\n\nAs parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. But a leader who engendered dissent within the party like Pelosi likely would not have survived.\n\nAD\n\nPelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power\n\nIf Democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until Pelosi leaves office. Since Pelosi was elected House minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.\n\nAD\n\nConsider the rule changes to which Pelosi reportedly agreed. The changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. Pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.\n\nBut that is not a significant change. The rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. The new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. The other promised changes have such large loopholes that Pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the House floor.\n\nLikewise, Pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. In 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as House speaker. She will have served as the top Democrat in the House for 19 years. If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, Pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. And if the Republican experience provides any guidance, Democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.
A bipartisan meeting on immigration policy at the White House on Tuesday is designed to bring the sides together. If Trump and lawmakers can strike an immigration deal, negotiators on both sides think that other issues, including how to fund a children's health insurance program and a roughly $80 billion package to pay for disaster relief, could be resolved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese former congressional interns share why the battle in Congress over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is so personal. (Melissa Macaya, Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nAhead of the meeting, the Trump administration released to lawmakers a request to pay $18 billion over 10 years for a mix of walls, fencing and other security technology. GOP lawmakers have said they were waiting for the plan to know the parameters of talks with Democrats.\n\nInstead of the saber-rattling, let's get in a room and figure out reasonable, sound policy for securing the border, helping [dreamers] . . . and solving this problem for the first time in two decades, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a lead GOP immigration negotiator, told Fox News Channel on Sunday.\n\nBut Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who voted against the temporary spending plan in December, characterized the looming shutdown as an opportunity for Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAD\n\nI believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, Democrats will regain the House and Senate. But you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, Sanders said in an interview. If it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'It doesn't make a difference. Why should I be involved?' \n\nHere's a look at the dreamers whose DACA protections are set to expire. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans control Congress but Democrats hold significant leverage over spending talks. In the House, hard-liners on the right have regularly voted against recent spending bills, requiring GOP leaders to rely on at least some Democratic votes to pass. In the Senate, spending bills require at least 60 votes to avoid procedural hurdles, and Republicans only hold 51 seats.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a lead Democratic negotiator on immigration, called Trump's detailed request outrageous and said he would continue working instead with Republicans who understand what is at stake in hopes of striking a bipartisan deal.\n\nAD\n\nProgressives such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose Harlem-area district is home to more than 2,000 constituents protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, said he will continue voting against GOP spending plans that don't include protections. Over the holiday recess, he said DACA was the issue I heard about the most when I'm walking in my district.\n\nEvery time it's delayed, the movement just gets stronger, the outcry gets louder, he added.\n\nProgressive groups are planning to apply fresh pressure on Democrats who voted to temporarily extend government funding in December without addressing DACA — a mix of moderates facing reelection this year in states Trump won in 2016 and others from states with sizable populations of federal government workers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe are laser-focused on January 19 as a do-or-die moment, said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group organizing protests on Capitol Hill against Republicans and Democrats who have voted for previous GOP spending bills.\n\nAlthough the situation facing dreamers is a crisis that was created by Donald Trump, Martinez said Democrats are not without power, especially now that Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) has joined the caucus. They have a closer margin now, and we expect them to meet their public and private commitment to us that they'll use every leverage they have.\n\nIndivisible, the progressive grass-roots network of citizen groups, said it will focus its efforts on six Democratic senators from left-leaning states — Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall of New Mexico and Tim Kaine and Mark R. Warner of Virginia. Kaine, Stabenow and Heinrich face reelection this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have done a poor job of playing hardball, said Angel Padilla, the group's policy director. They said for three months they would use their leverage in December to get this done, and that didn't happen. In order to have leverage, the other side has to believe you'll use that leverage, and I don't think that [Republicans] think that [Democrats] will use that leverage.\n\nSpokesmen for the senators said the lawmakers support dreamers but had various reasons for backing the last spending bill.\n\nUdall said a government shutdown would be a disaster for New Mexico and the 45,000 residents who work for the federal agencies and research labs in his state.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, said he will keep pushing for a solution for dreamers and he'll evaluate a deal once he's seen it.\n\nAD\n\nDespite Trump's renewed calls for a border wall, Republicans remain frayed over how to move forward. Some moderates are willing to either pass a bill giving dreamers a path to citizenship or craft a deal with Democrats that would include some border security measures. But the bulk of the conservative rank-and-file want more in exchange for accepting an immigration policy that much of the Republican base opposes.\n\nAs the fulcrum of the immigration talks has shifted decisively toward the Senate, lawmakers on the hard right are pressuring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to be more assertive. They are wary that House members will get jammed with a Senate bill that they will have no choice but to pass mainly with Democratic votes.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said it was essential that House Republicans pass a stand-alone immigration bill that promotes conservative priorities in line with Trump's agenda.\n\nAD\n\nIf the only thing you do is wait for something the Senate can pass, then what we might as well do is have the House recess for the next nine months, he said. Allowing Democrats to dictate immigration policy at a time of Republican control of Congress and the White House is distasteful and certainly not in keeping with what we promised the American people.\n\nAmid a slate of partisan and bipartisan proposals, another conservative immigration plan may emerge in the coming days. According to a lawmaker and a GOP aide familiar with the plans, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is expected to unveil a bill as soon as this week that would address DACA in exchange for a raft of conservative priorities on immigration.\n\nAD\n\nGoodlatte's plan would grant legal status to DACA recipients, provide funding for a border wall, end a visa lottery program criticized by Trump, take action against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and roll back rules allowing legal immigrants to sponsor the entry of certain family members. But House Republican leaders do not think the bill will be able to garner enough support to pass by the deadline.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for Goodlatte declined to comment.\n\nBipartisan immigration talks in the House have produced little visible progress. A bipartisan group of moderates, the Problem Solvers Caucus, created an immigration task force that formed the outlines of a deal, said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), one of the participants, but the larger caucus wouldn't sign on.\n\nWe're not there right now, and we're going to start working on it again when we come back, Coffman said.\n\nAshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said he was continuing to speak with lawmakers in both chambers but isn't committed to permitting a vote on a bill granting dreamers a path to citizenship.\n\nBeyond DACA, Republicans and Democrats say they're making progress over how much money should go to the military vs. domestic programs, something that has to be settled to raise automatic spending caps.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House wants to set discretionary defense spending levels at about $603 billion, which would exceed current automatic spending caps by $54 billion. Republicans think non-defense levels should see less of an increase, closer to $35 billion. But Democrats are insisting on parity, arguing in recent weeks that non-defense spending bolsters programs to fight opioid addiction and terrorism and protect the southern border.\n\nSanders said he would urge Congress to reject any deal that increases military spending by more than what is spent on domestic programs. If we're going to spend a dollar more in the military, we must spend a dollar more on the enormously important issues facing working families. All of these issues are in crisis mode, and they have to be dealt with right now.
If you're doing any Cargill-related business – if for example you have a conference call and you think you should take it from home on your commute into work in the morning — that's absolutely not acceptable, company spokeswoman April Nelson said. She said GPS devices necessary for navigation may be used so long as they are programmed before travel and mounted for hands-free use.\n\nAD\n\nThe Minnesota-based company, whose new policy applies to about 150,000 employees worldwide, is not the first or the largest to institute such a strict ban. But advocates at the National Safety Council believe Cargill is the largest privately held corporation to do so.\n\nAD\n\nDeborah A.P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. It's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.\n\nThey're really just looking at their risks and looking at the data, Hersman said.\n\nThe National Safety Council says motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of work-related fatalities and account for about 24 percent of all work-related injuries. The nonprofit organization, using 2010 data, estimates that at least 24 percent of all fatal crashes involved drivers using cell phones and that at least 160,000 crashed involved drivers who were texting.\n\nIf anything, driving while texting or talking on a mobile device has become ever more widespread since then. Some experts believe that recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in traffic deaths can be blamed at least in part on the widespread habit of texting or talking while driving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCargill — whose businesses range from agriculture to financial services — decided to act because of the ubiquity of smartphones and a growing number of statistics suggesting that these devices are too often the culprits in traffic crashes, Nelson said. There was no specific incident that caused the company to to implement the policy, she said.\n\nOverall, it's making sure employees know of the dangers of driving while distracted and how important that Cargill feels that safety is first, Nelson said.\n\nEmployees could be disciplined for infractions, with actions ranging from a talk with the boss to termination, but that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, Nelson said. She said the company is relying mostly on an honor system and peers to monitor and enforce the new policy.\n\nAD\n\nRight now, we are focused on stopping distracted driving and less on what the punishments will be for violating the policy, Nelson said. We will look at factors such as how egregious a violation is, if someone is doing it repeatedly, if they have received warnings in the past, and other factors to determine the appropriate consequences.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Safety Council, again citing 2010 figures, says 20 percent of the Fortune 500 companies imposed total bans. Some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as Pokemon Go, are not on them, Hersman said. And a survey cited by the Council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.\n\nThere's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. Hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. Some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.\n\nAD\n\nBut a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. Over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.\n\nAD\n\nOne company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a Saturday night. In a 2010 case in Texas cited by the Council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.\n\nSo it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. A National Safety Council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.\n\nAD\n\nBut at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. Hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as Cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use. At one time, smoking was accepted almost everywhere, and now it's not. And people are no longer shy about asking others to put out the cigarette. Hersman said she hopes that eventually, more Americans will no longer view texting while driving as acceptable behavior, either.\n\nAD\n\nYou really have to change your mindset to put your employees' safety and the safety of others on the road first, she said.
Adam Staveski, 22, policy analyst, and Maddie Csere, 22, financial analyst. (Photo courtesy of daters)\n\nInterviews by Amanda McGrath\n\nPolicy analyst Adam Staveski, 22, and financial analyst Maddie Csere, also 22, are fresh-faced and fresh out of local colleges, enjoying their first year as D.C. young professionals. We sent them to Maple in Columbia Heights to see if a shared love of running, economics and a laid-back attitude was enough to spark a fresh romance.\n\nMaddie: I was freaking out all week — this is a little out of my comfort zone. I almost didn't come. But within 30 seconds, I was like, This is going to be absolutely fine.\n\nAdam: She was exactly my type. She's very pretty, she's friendly and gregarious — our personalities seemed to click right off the bat.\n\nMaddie: I know exactly why they paired me with him: He's tall, athletic, has a slimmer build, which is what I said my type was.\n\nAdam:We could pick up the conversation like we were old friends.\n\nMaddie: He was very kind and definitely excited to be there, which made me excited to be there.\n\nAdam: We both grew up in small-town environments [and] came to D.C. for college.\n\nMaddie: We both studied economics. He told me about his job, and it was really cool and interesting. I don't get to talk to other econ people that often.\n\nAdam: My job is very niche — most people think it's the most boring thing of all time. I was glad she didn't think it was super lame.\n\nMaddie: I went to [George Washington University] and he went to American University; we talked about D.C. school rivalries.\n\nAdam: It seems like everyone hates Georgetown, but it's like [American] is rivals with [GWU], jockeying for position as the second-best school in D.C.\n\nMaddie: I don't know. I don't really believe in the school rivalries.\n\nAdam: She said, No, people at GW don't care. I was like, shoot, maybe American kids are way more petty. [Laughs.]\n\nMaddie: He's a really good runner. I recently ran a marathon for the first time; he ran the Marine Corps in an insane time and is running [in] Boston next year.\n\nAdam: She asked for my time and I said I ran 2:43. She was astounded. I was like, Nice, she's impressed!\n\nMaddie: We talked about meeting famous people. I was obsessed with One Direction at one point in my life and met Harry Styles after waiting outside the British Fashion Awards for four hours. It was ridiculous. [Adam] was on The Daily Show once; they came up to him on the street and interviewed him for a segment.\n\nAdam: We both found out — weird fact — we're both missing our front teeth.\n\nMaddie: We both have fake teeth — I'm pretty sure that's not something I put in my application.\n\nAdam: She's very genuine. I'm like, Wow, you are a cool, amazing, interesting person that I'm excited to talk to.\n\nMaddie: He's one of the most genuinely nice people I've ever met in my whole life. If you meet him, you immediately know he's not a very judgmental person.\n\nAdam: There seemed to be depth to her. She's not predictable. We delved briefly into politics, and rather than being a staunch partisan, she's able to look at situations with a lot of nuance, more so than a lot of people in the D.C. area.\n\nMaddie: We align a bit [politically], but my family is a little divided, so I was talking about how growing up in rural Michigan gives me a different perspective.\n\nAdam: I would say the overall vibe was more friendly than flirtatious. It's hard on a first date to really give out too strong of a signal without it being weird.\n\nMaddie: I got more of a friend vibe from our conversation. There wasn't totally a spark there, [but also] I'm not quick to fall for people. I'm still processing things.\n\nAdam: Both of us were surprised by the time we left that we'd been there so long.\n\nMaddie: We sat for three hours, and I really didn't think it had been that long. It was 10:30 at that point; I'm normally home by 8 on weeknights. We left and he walked me to the Metro, even though it was out of his way.\n\nAdam: I walked her back to the Metro and asked for her phone number.\n\nMaddie: I hugged him and then we left. He texted me that night to make sure I got home okay.\n\nAdam: I'd personally be interested in a second date. I'm on a quest to go to every Metro station on the map; she seemed interested in that, so maybe it could be an informal, casual way to see if there's something there.\n\nMaddie: I could see us being pretty good friends in the future; he's such a nice human, which is kind of rare to find at our age. I don't think we clicked romantically, but I'm not sure — my thoughts aren't very clear on this yet.\n\nRate the date\n\nAdam: A 4.5 [out of 5]. It was an extremely pleasant evening. I left feeling very happy.\n\nMaddie: A solid 3.5. I really, really liked talking to him. It didn't feel like a date totally for me, but it was a great night.\n\nUpdate\n\nThey've stayed in touch via text; a second date is possible, they say, but so far they haven't set any plans.
1. How does the system work?\n\nIt's an opaque process. Vietnam has a collective four pillar leadership structure made up of general secretary, prime minister, president and chair of the National Assembly, the nation's parliament. It governs in consultation with a 17- to 19-member politburo. Nguyen Phu Trong, the current general secretary, also became president in 2018 following the death of President Tran Dai Quang, meaning the top leadership was down to three. Observers anticipate the government will revert to four pillars in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. Who chooses what?\n\nThe 13th National Party Congress is scheduled to be held Jan. 25 through Feb. 2. About 1,600 delegates from across the country will vote to select about 200 members to the Central Committee, which in turn will pick the politburo and from that group the party general secretary. The politburo will then nominate candidates for prime minister and the cabinet. These will go to a vote in the National Assembly mid-year.\n\n3. Who's in contention for the top job?\n\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, 66, who has won plaudits for guiding the country through the pandemic relatively unscathed, may be in the running for the party chief. His chief rival could be the incumbent's protege, Tran Quoc Vuong, 67, head of the party's central office, who spearheaded Trong's aggressive anti-corruption campaign. Trong, 76, may even pursue another full or partial third term. Possible contenders for other top jobs:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n• Vuong Dinh Hue, 63, a former minister of finance, deputy prime minister and head of the Party's Central Economic Commission, may be in the running for prime minister.\n\n• Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, 61, who holds a master's degree from Tufts University in the U.S. and is also deputy prime minister, is a possible candidate for president.\n\n• Truong Thi Mai, 62, a Central Committee member, could be the second woman elected as chair of the National Assembly.\n\n4. What challenges await?\n\nOn the one hand, boosting growth in the export-dependent nation following a sharp global recession. On the other, doing so without further upsetting the U.S., its biggest export market. The U.S. put Vietnam on notice in October by opening a trade investigation into its currency policy and then imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties on Vietnamese car and truck tires, citing an undervalued currency. In December, the U.S. Treasury designated the Southeast Asian country a currency manipulator, which comes with no immediate penalties but can escalate trade tensions. Vietnam's authorities will be keen to secure greater access to American consumers while tamping down concerns about the surging trade surplus, on pace in 2020 to break the previous year's record $56 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n5. How has Covid-19 affected the country?\n\nAt year-end Vietnam had one of the lowest virus death counts globally, having contained the pathogen. However, economic growth slowed to 2.91% at the end of 2020 as the global downturn brought on by the pandemic sapped demand for made-in-Vietnam products, from smartphones to dress shirts. The government forecasts a 2021 expansion of about 6% compared with 7.02% in 2019.\n\n6. What about superpower relations?\n\nVietnam depends on China for key materials and equipment to supply its factories. Yet relations with its powerful neighbor -- the two countries fought a brief border war in 1979 -- are fraught and further inflamed because of competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Vietnam's coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, or 2,100 miles, follows one of the world's busiest sea cargo lanes.) Vietnam favors greater U.S. economic and military presence in the region to counter China's growing might and is expected to push for a close relationship with the Biden administration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n7. How are Vietnamese faring?\n\nAs decades of market-oriented economic reforms boost incomes and nurture a growing middle class, Vietnam is among the world's most optimistic countries, according to a Nielsen survey. Yet human rights advocates criticize restrictions of basic political and civil freedoms. Arrests and trials of Vietnamese who speak out on issues such as corruption have grown markedly following a new cybersecurity law in 2019, according to Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia. There's typically an up-tick in arrests before the party congress, he said.\n\n8. What will a new government mean for investors?\n\nAD\n\nMore of the same. Vietnam's successful handling of the pandemic, improving infrastructure, investor-friendly policies, political stability and its well-educated, young and low-cost workforce is likely to continue attracting international companies. Expect further efforts by the new leadership to sell Vietnam as an increasingly high-tech manufacturing base for suppliers of global giants such as Apple Inc. One concern for companies will be the risk that the trade rift with the U.S. could trigger additional tariffs.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
It sounds like the Broncos want to have their cake and eat it, too, getting Romo without giving up anything to the Cowboys in return. That may prove impossible, as Dallas is well aware of the highly valuable commodity of which it is in possession, given the NFL's perpetual shortage of quality starting quarterbacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, holding on to Romo while waiting for just the perfect moment to deal him to another team that suddenly finds itself with a need at his position, as the Eagles did in trading Sam Bradford to the Vikings just before the regular season started, could prove problematic for the Cowboys. Beginning with offseason training activities in the spring, every day that Romo spends with the team will provide opportunities for reporters to ask him, owner Jerry Jones and everyone else in Dallas how they feel about the awkward situation.\n\nRomo, who graciously turned the quarterbacking reins over to rookie Dak Prescott in November, would surely be upset with such a hardball strategy by his longtime team. In addition, Romo is close with Jones, who may feel that, as matter of courtesy and respect, he owes it to the 36-year-old to simply release him and let him choose his own team. Another possibility is that Dallas hangs on to Romo, as a valuable and well-paid insurance policy, but again, Jones risks tension in his locker room.\n\nIn 2012, the Colts released Peyton Manning, knowing that they were set to draft Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick. Another factor in that decision was that Indianapolis had salary-cap issues while Manning was set to make a huge amount of money (he was due a $28 million roster bonus), which also made him nearly impossible to trade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, once Manning was released, he eventually landed with the Broncos, which worked out very well for everyone in Denver. Coming off multiple neck surgeries, the decorated quarterback not only rewrote the record book but won a Super Bowl in February 2016.\n\nIt's not hard to see a similar dynamic playing with Romo, who recovered this season from a back injury, not the first of his career. The Broncos still have a terrific defense, talent at wide receiver and running back and, just as importantly, a potential need at his position and the ability to absorb a hefty contract.\n\nDenver drafted a quarterback, Memphis's Paxton Lynch, in the first round last year, but it gave the bulk of the starts this past season to an unheralded second-year player, Trevor Siemian. The Northwestern product acquitted himself respectably, but he led a struggling offense that was called out by members of the Broncos' defense, and there is little doubt that a healthy Romo would represent an upgrade, at least for a couple of seasons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven that Siemian and Lynch are both playing on rookie contracts, the Broncos should be able to accommodate Romo's salary, which will be $14 million next year, after which he will have two more seasons left on a six-year, $108 million contract. The website Spotrac lists Denver as having $38,410,833 in 2017 salary-cap space, and teams can usually find ways of freeing up more room when necessary.\n\nThe Denver Post's Mark Kiszla recently asked in a column advocating the acquisition of Romo, Can Denver really afford to waste another year of this championship defense with a young quarterback not ready for prime time? Gary Kubiak tried that bluff this year, and it ended with ugly shouting in a locker room divided by the frustration of seven losses.
This Sunday, Feb. 4, will mark the one-year anniversary of the death of student Timothy Piazza. The university continues to mourn his tragic passing. In the immediate aftermath, it became clear wholesale changes were needed to create a sustainable Greek system. We resolved to turn the pain and anguish radiating through our community into decisive reform.\n\nOver the past year, the university instituted extensive new measures , which depart significantly from the Greek system's self-governance model. We are making progress:\n\nThe university assumed control of the fraternity and sorority organizational misconduct and adjudication process, and established a team of monitors who perform regular spot checks. These compliance checks have surfaced violations of our new safety rules and resulted in several chapters receiving sanctions.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the university held a signing ceremony with 70 Greek organization leaders representing 49 chapters and the four governing councils . . . acknowledging the expectations that the university has for its Greek organizations and members.\n\nWe instituted our new deferred recruitment policy. Now, new students may not rush a sorority or fraternity until they have completed a full semester. Many sorority students report that waiting to rush this past semester was helpful, because they adjusted to academic and social life on campus, and are now better prepared to consider participation in Greek life.\n\nTo help students and their families make more informed decisions about Greek life at Penn State, we instituted a scorecard that reviews the performance of each chapter.\n\nUniversity-hired chapter monitors are working with representatives of each fraternity house with respect to their chapter's specific risk-management programs. Risk-management programs must be in place and approved by the university and must include details on how our restrictions on the size of gatherings, our ban on hard liquor and various other required safety protocols will be implemented. The university must approve each plan before any socials involving alcohol are permitted.\n\nOur campus police participate in joint nightly patrols with State College Police as part of the Neighborhood Enforcement Alcohol Team at University Park. These patrols have detected safety violations and helped to hold students and chapters accountable for unsafe behavior.\n\nOur zero tolerance rule for serious hazing is in place, and will result in the permanent revocation of recognition of any chapter found to have violated the university's requirements.\n\nThese measures are making a difference. I am encouraged that we have received letters from our local community about improved chapter behavior in State College. Local law enforcement and others report reduced crowd sizes at fraternity gatherings. Fraternity and sorority leaders are working more closely with the university to implement the new safety programs. This is important progress.\n\nUnfortunately, however, significant problems remain. In addition to the permanent Beta Theta Pi ban, a total of 13 other Greek organizations at Penn State have received multiyear suspensions for safety violations. While these consequences demonstrate that we mean business, the large number of suspended chapters also shows that many students have ignored the call for behavior change and fallen short of our values and expectations.\n\nOne of the underlying tenets of belonging to a community is the shared responsibility for the safety and well-being of its members.\n\nTo that end, as we approach the one-year anniversary of a terrible tragedy we must do more:\n\nAll of our students, as adults, must recognize the importance of safety and make changes in your own lives that will create a safer community.\n\nOur Greek-letter community needs to embrace the need for change and rededicate yourselves to a mission of service and community. We must do better.\n\nNational Greek organizations absolutely must assume leadership responsibility. Three chapters that lost university recognition, Alpha Chi Rho, Alpha Sigma Phi and Sigma Alpha Mu, did not receive chapter suspensions from their national offices. That is unacceptable.\n\nParents and Greek alumni should provide a much higher level of support to their chapters and provide guidance and mentoring. Sadly, we found in our monitoring that parents of students in some chapters helped students violate the law and university rules against alcohol consumption.\n\nWe must set a national example for reform. To that end, on April 23 and 24, I look forward to gathering university presidents, provosts and student affairs leaders from across the country to begin to explore ideas for cooperative action.\n\nWe also continue to work with Pennsylvania and federal legislators toward stricter hazing penalties. In short, we will not rest in our efforts, with the hope that this kind of tragedy never occurs again.\n\nThank you for your attention, and for your commitment to these efforts. Much remains to be done, and the memory of Timothy Piazza deserves nothing less than our collective action.
The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.\n\nThe combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.\n\nThere are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.\n\nUnemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.\n\nThis intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.\n\nSomething we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.\n\nAll of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.\n\nTurning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.\n\nThis is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.\n\nSecond, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.
Many foreign observers, already glued to news of the final chapters of the election saga, reacted with alarm and even grief, especially in allied countries that have looked to U.S. democracy for inspiration.\n\nThe United States Congress has been the symbol of freedom and democracy around the world for centuries, tweeted Armin Laschet, the leader of Germany's most populous federal state. The attacks on the Capitol by fanatical Trump supporters hurt every friend of the United States.\n\nLeaders around the world condemned the pro-Trump mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and reaffirmed their faith in American democracy. (The Washington Post)\n\nAcross much of Europe, top officials echoed these sentiments. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the scenes of chaos disgraceful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canada's News 1130 radio station in Vancouver that his government is concerned and following the situation minute by minute.\n\nI think the American democratic institutions are strong, and hopefully everything will return to normal shortly, he said.\n\nThe surge of reactions from allies and foreign observers illustrated one of the Trump era's key consequences, which has become only more apparent as it winds to a chaotic close: The beleaguered but persistent role of the United States as a model for democratic norms and institutions — in its own self-conception and in the eyes of friends — has been severely tarnished.\n\nAD\n\nIn the view of the world, the Trump era provided no shortage of captivating spectacle, sometimes grim. Wednesday's events went beyond that, into disconcerting territory: far-right attacks on democracy made literal. Chilling footage from the scene circulated globally, of lawmakers fleeing, Capitol Police with their guns drawn inside the Capitol building and a mob of angry Trump supporters running loose in the halls. One photo showed a man sitting in the chair of a member of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) staff, his feet on the desk. Another showed a man appearing to carry away the speaker's lectern.\n\nAD\n\nThe turmoil also gave an opening for countries with poor track records on human rights and democracy to lecture a superpower.\n\nTurkey, a NATO ally that has been widely condemned for jailing thousands of critics, academics, journalists and artists and has seen its partnership with the United States deteriorate in recent years, called on all parties in the U.S.A. to show restraint and common sense, in a statement released by its Foreign Ministry.\n\nAD\n\nIn Venezuela — which has been embroiled in political and social crises for years — Jorge Arreaza, the foreign minister in authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro's government, issued a statement condemning the political polarization and the spiral of violence that reflects the profound political and social crisis the United States is currently experiencing.\n\nAD\n\nJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader who was supported by the Trump administration in his claim to the interim presidency of Venezuela, said the attack on the Capitol was an attack on democracy. My thoughts are with the citizens and officials who feel the roots of their country were attacked.\n\nDmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, also took the opportunity to allege U.S. hypocrisy.\n\nAD\n\nAllies struck a different tone.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, described the situation as utterly horrifying and called for solidarity with those … on the side of democracy and the peaceful and constitutional transfer of power. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tweeted that the people of Ireland have a deep connection with the United States and that many, like me, will be watching the scenes unfolding in Washington DC with great concern and dismay.\n\nAD\n\nEnemies of democracy will be happy to see these unbelievable pictures from #WashingtonDC. Riotous words turn into violent acts — on the steps of the Reichstag, and now in the #Capitol, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted, referring to far-right protesters who rushed the historic German parliament building in August. The disdain for democratic institutions is devastating.\n\nAD\n\nSome foreign outlets, including the BBC and the Australian newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald, maintained live coverage of Wednesday's developments in Washington.\n\nMany eyes were already turned on the United States, as foreign observers tracked the closely contested runoff Senate race in Georgia. By Wednesday afternoon, both Democratic candidates, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, had been declared winners — tipping the Senate to the Democrats, thereby granting the party control of both the White House and Congress.\n\nAD\n\nHow I would like to be a voter of the #DekalbCounty in #Georgia! And vote #Ossoff, former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta tweeted earlier in the day, referring to a Georgia county with a large number of Democratic voters.\n\nAD\n\nU. S. and international politics over the next few years will depend on his victory, he wrote. Those votes will affect us too.\n\nLetta has been a vocal critic of Trump's handling of the election. When Trump tweeted, STOP THE COUNT the day after polls closed in November, Letta responded, IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY!\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described a man sitting at the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The story has been updated to correct that the man was sitting at the desk of a member of Pelosi's staff.
With that in mind, an intriguing possibility emerged: What if the ultimate goal of that trade was to pry Jimmy Garoppolo away from the Patriots?\n\nAmong others proposing that scenario was Mary Kay Cabot, a longtime Browns beat writer. The Browns have the ammunition to acquire Jimmy Garoppolo and will try to put together a strong package that the Patriots will accept, she wrote at cleveland.com.\n\nAs Cabot noted on Twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for Tony Romo to possibly join the Texans. Having lured Osweiler away from the Broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, Houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. Osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup Tom Savage, and the Texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land Romo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Browns signaled that they don't have much use for Osweiler, either, with football operations chief Sashi Brown starting off his official statement on the deal with, We're really excited to acquire a second-round draft choice in this trade.\n\nDraft picks are extremely important to our approach in building a championship caliber football team, Brown added. We are intent on adding competition to every position on our roster and look forward to having Brock come in and compete.\n\nIt Cleveland doesn't turn around and trade Osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — Osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. That may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what NBA teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the NFL, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. In any event, if it helps land the highly regarded Garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the Browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA second-round pick in 2014, Garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when Tom Brady was serving his Deflategate suspension. The 25-year-old completed 68.3 of his passes for 502 yards, four touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 113.3 rating, showing impressive decision-making and pocket presence.\n\nWith the 39-year-old Brady's play showing no signs of deterioration en route to a championship season, the Patriots have the luxury of dangling Garoppolo for a king's ransom or simply keeping him for one more season as an excellent insurance policy against a possible Brady injury. New England recently signaled it was more than willing to take the latter approach, but that could be a negotiating stance.\n\nCabot and others had already reported that the Browns were interested in trading for Garoppolo, and it's entirely possible that the Patriots have been playing hardball with them behind the scenes. Cleveland holds the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, but understandably wants to keep it. The Browns also have the No. 12 pick, which could be in play but possibly not enough to get a deal done.\n\nNow the Browns have another high-value pick to offer, even after amassing a war chest that includes two second-rounders this year and 11 selections altogether. They also have extra picks in 2018's fourth and sixth rounds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf there's an NFL team known for a strategy of stocking up on draft picks, it's the Patriots, who have often traded back from their first-round positions, sometimes to the dismay of their fans (although they obviously can't complain much about the results). Could this year's No. 12 pick, plus a second-rounder, get them to give up Garoppolo? How about three second-round picks? We may find out, but the team can hardly expect to see a stronger offers than those for an essentially still-unproven player.
Intel Drops Plans for ID Numbers By Robert O'Harrow Jr. and Elizabeth Corcoran\n\nWashington Post Staff Writers\n\nTuesday, January 26, 1999; Page E1 Intel Corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the Internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. The turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott Intel products in protest of the chip's ID component. This is a significant victory for privacy, said Barry Steinhardt, associate director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who praised Intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. They did it on Internet time. In announcing the ID feature of the new Pentium III microprocessor last week, Intel officials described it as an important step for Internet security. The ID number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. While each chip still will have a unique number, Intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the ID function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif., company, acknowledged that Intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. We're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, Mulloy said. You must account for privacy if you're going to have security. But some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. Computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. Instead, users must electronically fetch the program from Intel's Web site. In addition, the utility program is available only for Windows software. -Those who use the Linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. Privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the World Wide Web – in essence, allowing businesses at those Web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other Web sites. The default for privacy should be no ID number, said David Banisar, policy director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a advocacy group in Washington that helped organize the Intel boycott. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. I have great concerns about any unique identifier Web sites might use without any rules, said Markey, who wrote a letter to Intel complaining about the chip last week. © Copyright The Washington Post Company Back to the top
AD\n\nPlenty of that is going to happen behind the scenes, but we already know what many of the campaign benchmarks will be this year. The political calendar is slowly filling in, and the window for candidates to announce is fairly narrow; no one who went on to win his or her party's nomination in this century announced (or formed an exploratory committee) any later than April the year before the election.\n\nAD\n\nJan. 18-21: The AFL-CIO will hold its Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference, which is open to 2020 contenders; there's little buzz about this so far, but it has the potential to be the Democrats' first cattle call, and the AFL-CIO has the clout to call Democrats in whenever it wants.\n\nJan. 19: The third Women's March will take place around the country, with special plans for Washington, where organizers are putting together a lobbying day focused on getting a House vote on Medicare-for-all and where they'll release a Women's Agenda, This will be the first of these marches since a battery of controversies for the umbrella Women's March organization, especially of the association between one organizer and Louis Farrakhan. But most Democrats with presidential ambitions have spoken at previous marches and are expected to again.\n\nAD\n\nJan. 31-Feb. 3: The Republican National Committee meets in Washington, where it will continue to clarify its 2020 primary rules, amid serious discussion of altering them to make any challenge to President Trump impossible.\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 13-16: The Democratic National Committee meets, also in Washington, and will make one of the final big decisions before the primary: the site of the 2020 convention. In the past, this meeting has also drawn in a few presidential contenders, though changes to primary rules have diminished the delegate voting power of DNC members.\n\nFeb. 22: New Hampshire's McIntyre-Shaheen Dinner will unfold in Manchester. It's likely to be the first cattle call in an early voting state, coming after a number of first-tier candidates have entered the race.\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 27-March 2: The annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, will be held again in suburban Washington. Trump has appeared there every year since entering the 2016 Republican primary, and the local reception for him has evolved from contempt (2016) to jubilation (2017) to outright adoration (2018).\n\nAD\n\nMarch 10-13: The annual International Association of Fire Fighters conference comes to D.C., and the first day typically takes place in a ballroom near the Capitol, with prominent politicians invited to speak on any topic to members. The union's longtime president Harold Schaitberger has already all but pledged to back Joe Biden if he enters the race.\n\nMarch 24-26: One of the largest annual political events in the country, the AIPAC Policy Conference, will be held in downtown Washington. Traditionally, the off-year sessions don't give many speaking slots to presidential candidates; that's reserved for election years. But the event, anchored by a lengthy speech from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is built to showcase the clout of pro-Israel lobbyists, and worries about declining support for Israel among Democratic voters have become a topic there.\n\nAD\n\nMarch 31: It's the end of the first fundraising quarter, the first traditional gut check and re-sorting of any presidential field. In the 2008 cycle, this was the moment when Barack Obama nearly matched Hillary Clinton's money haul, firming up the idea that he was a credible challenger. Note that Obama announced his numbers in the first week of April; campaigns are not required to turn everything in to the Federal Election Commission until April 15, but increasingly, campaigns like to get a jump on the official filing and calculate their totals for the press.\n\nAD\n\nLate April: One of the last Fridays in this month is devoted to House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry, an annual event that stands out for Democrats for a simple reason: It's the biggest political gathering for African American voters in an early primary state.\n\nMay 21: Statewide primaries will take place in Kentucky, one of three states that will elect a governor this year. In 2015, eventual Democratic nominee Jack Conway spent the whole campaign evading questions about who he'd back for president, saying he would support Joe Biden, who was not running. Why should a candidate for governor answer that question? It's fair to ask, but tying the Democratic candidate to his national party has become a go-to tactic for Republicans here. Any Democrat who wants to prove his or her strength outside of blue America will be paying attention.\n\nAD\n\nMay 31-June 2: The California Democratic Party Convention is happening in San Francisco this year, and, for the first time since 2008, the state has secured an early slot on the primary calendar. That's likely to turn this into a showcase for multiple Democrats, in a forum where a good speech, in front of a massive audience, can get national attention. It was here in 2003 that Howard Dean pronounced himself a member of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party and assailed Democrats who'd backed the Iraq War.\n\nAD\n\nJune: The first official Democratic presidential primary debate will take place, location to be determined. The DNC has sanctioned six debates in 2019, all of them to be held outside the first four primary states. That means, in practice, that the candidates who make it onstage will burn 12 to 18 days this year on prep, travel and the debates themselves.\n\nMid-June: Mitt Romney's annual donor summit is expected to celebrate its fifth year in Park City, Utah, — the first, obviously, with the host representing the state as a senator. There will be several moments when Republicans ask (or the press prods them to ask) if the party can go into 2020 with Trump still leading it; this will be the most scenic of those moments.\n\nAD\n\nJune 30: The end of the second fundraising quarter, which can be a winnowing moment for candidates who have not yet shown any ability to stack money.\n\nAD\n\nJuly. The NAACP Convention will take place in Detroit; typically, the event includes a candidate forum where presidential contenders get equal time to speak and are encouraged to discuss civil rights.\n\nJuly 11-13: The 14th Netroots Nation conference will take place in Philadelphia; for the third time, it will feature some sort of forum for Democratic presidential candidates. In 2007, that took the form of a debate, which made some news when Hillary Clinton got into an argument about lobbyists (they represent real Americans). In 2015 it became a series of Q&As with the candidates who had bothered to show up; both Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders were interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists. This year, organizers say the format is to be determined.\n\nAD\n\nAug. 8-18: It's the most cliche-rich event in politics: the Iowa State Fair. It's also a focusing event for candidates, who are given time at a Des Moines Register-sponsored soapbox to deliver their stump speech.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 2: Multiple primary states will be holding Labor Day events; the AFL-CIO's breakfast in New Hampshire has frequently become a go-to event for Democrats that day. (Sanders has attended it every year since 2016.)\n\nMid-September: The New Hampshire Democratic Party holds its convention in Manchester, giving candidates the biggest captive audience they'll have in that state until the new year.\n\nSept. 28: Since 2017, the last Saturday of the month has been given over to the Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry, a successor to the Iowa candidate cattle call that former senator Tom Harkin held for years.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 30: This is the end of the third fundraising quarter, and by this point in previous cycles, candidates who've struggled have seen their futures and dropped out. In 2011 and 2015, the first two Republican primaries in the era of the super PAC, several candidates plowed forward despite raising nearly nothing for their own campaigns. The toxicity of big money PACs in Democratic politics is likely to alter that trend.\n\nAD\n\nOctober: Iowa Democrats will hold their Fall Dinner, formerly known as the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. This was the event that turned Obama into the Iowa front-runner, after months of slogging through and underperforming at candidate forums.\n\nDec. 31: Every New Year's Eve before the Iowa caucuses marks the end of the fourth fundraising quarter; by Jan. 15, just a few weeks before voting, every candidate will have revealed his and her totals for the year. Then, and only then, will we know who endured the marathon, who ran out of money, and who kept raising money after being completely written off. And we're just 363 days away.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nWarren's Iowa adventure. Since the Massachusetts senator's last visit to Iowa, in 2014, a few parts of the state have grown a bit bluer. There's a lot more of Iowa that's gotten redder — and that's where Warren will be going.\n\nThree of Warren's five scheduled stops this weekend will take her to the 4th Congressional District, represented by Republican Steve King. Pottawattamie County backed Trump by 21 points, Woodbury County by 20 points, Buena Vista County by 24 points. And all went by double digits for Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) in last year's statewide elections. Just 10 years ago, Barack Obama had lost them by only a few points.\n\nThat itinerary has turned some heads in Iowa. I'm excited that with so many people focused on Des Moines and urban areas, that she's coming out here, said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who narrowly lost to King last year. She's going to hear about health care. She's going to talk to people who are worried about market consolidation and how farmers are being squeezed, both on the input side and the output side.\n\nScholten, who ran 14 points ahead of Hillary Clinton in the district, had campaigned with a number of lesser-known Democrats with presidential ambitions. Warren, he said, had sent three fundraising letters on behalf of his campaign; when he was at the 2018 Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans, Warren made time for a meeting with him.\n\nMost of Warren's events are being promoted as organizing gatherings, as opposed to policy listening tour stops of the sort Clinton made in 2015. One is a roundtable in Storm Lake, a city in Buena Vista County, but Iowa Democrats point out that there's a unique local story there.\n\nI'm proud of her for choosing Storm Lake, said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democratic Party. It's one of the few Iowa cities that's growing, and it's because it's been very welcoming to immigrants. It's known as a melting pot in rural Iowa; I'd love to see more Democrats heading there.\n\nBut after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to Iowa, the stakes for Warren are high. This is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. Warren's first event on Saturday is at one of Sioux City's largest arts venues, one that Clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. Turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another Democrat who may run for president.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nNancy Pelosi is once again the speaker of the House, returning to the job after eight years despite 15 members of her party not voting for her. What matters for 2020 is that 20 Democrats in districts carried by the president backed the new speaker; Republicans, who need to win at least 19 seats to flip the House, immediately painted targets on them.\n\nWith the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them, said Dan Conston, the new president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, in a statement from the Republican super PAC. CLF will make sure voters know that their member of Congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch San Francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.\n\nThere's actually a spirited disagreement among Republicans about whether this attack works; Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the new chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, has worried that the obsessive focus on Pelosi in 2018 did little to boost Republicans outside of very safe districts.\n\nAnd the 20 Pelosi-backing Trump district Democrats really fit into two camps. One camp come from places where Trump performed more weakly than previous Republican nominees: Reps. Tom O'Halleran (Ariz.), Lucy McBath (Ga.), Lauren Underwood (Ill.), Haley Stevens (Mich.), Angie Craig (Minn.), Josh Gottheimer (Mass.) and Kendra Horn (Okla.).\n\nThe remaining 13 Democrats come from a range of districts, from the most Trump-friendly place represented by a Democrat (Minnesota's 7th) to Nevada's 3rd District, where Trump actually won a smaller share of the vote than Mitt Romney; third-party voters were responsible for his win margin.\n\nThe point: If Republicans knocked off every Democrat from a red-tinted district who voted for Pelosi today, and reelected every one of their incumbents, they'd come out of 2020 with a majority. But the map isn't that simple.\n\nStill, Republicans ended their first day of divided government by promising to hold pro-Pelosi Democrats accountable. America Rising blasted out a list of 21 Democrats who went back on their word to back Pelosi that included 11 from increasingly blue districts carried by Clinton. The House GOP's own rapid-response team called out 11 Democrats, nine of whom won in safe blue seats.\n\nAlso worth noting: While a few Democrats pledged specifically not to back Pelosi, many more found routes around the Pelosi question, saying that they wanted to see new leadership, or see who was seeking the gavel — and then, after the election, saying that Pelosi had won them over.\n\n2020\n\nBernie Sanders. The New York Times published the most comprehensive investigation so far of allegations of sexual harassment against staffers in the senator's 2016 campaign, an issue that had been bubbling under the surface for months. Sanders, who dislikes discussing scandal or campaign details more than most politicians, appeared on CNN on Wednesday and said that he supported changes in harassment reporting policy; then, he added that he was a little busy on the trail and thus unaware of the details as harassment was reported.\n\nTom Steyer. The next three stops on his five rights tour are Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada; he announced as much last month but clarified this week that the Iowa stop will be in Des Moines.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. She told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that she will decide soon on a 2020 bid.\n\nTerry McAuliffe. He published an op-ed in The Post today, urging Democrats to run on realistic solutions in 2020 — one way of saying they risked swinging too far to the left.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She sat down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night, making news when she criticized the foreign policy establishment that had criticized the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, though she said that the president's process for doing so was too slapdash.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nMedicare-for-all. It's official: The new Democratic House will hold hearings on single-payer health care, for the first time in decades — the first time, ever, that the current version of Medicare-for-all will go through the committee process.\n\nThat does not mean that the dream of the modern left will become law this year. But advocates know that. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the sponsor of the House legislation, said having public hearings and traditional scoring for the bill will elevate it as a 2020 issue.\n\nIt will ensure that this will be part of the 2020 presidential platforms, said Jayapal. We will be looking at every single candidate from this lens.\n\nWithin hours of Jayapal's announcement, potential 2020 candidates were celebrating. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), arriving at a party held for supporters Wednesday, told them that the House would be doing what cynics called impossible just years earlier.\n\nI want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare-for-all, he told The Post. I'm confident the results will show that Medicare-for-all is the way forward if we want to guarantee health care to all people in a cost-effective way.\n\nLeft-wing activists will step up their advocacy for Medicare-for-all in the coming days, with rallies for the policy around the Jan. 19 Women's March. MoveOn is also about to distribute a memo, written by Data for Progress, that crunched data from the 2018 election to argue that Democrats running on the policy were not effectively attacked for it by Republicans.\n\nNeither polling data nor actual election results suggest that embracing Medicare for All or the broader progressive agenda hurt Democratic politicians in 2018, Data for Progress concludes in the memo.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nFor the first time in decades, the House of Representatives opened a new session with one vacant seat — the 9th District of North Carolina. Mark Harris, the Republican who declared victory in that race in November, spent Thursday filing a motion in Wake County Superior Court, asking to be certified as a member of Congress.\n\nThe voters of the Ninth Congressional District are entitled to have their elected representative in place by the time Congress convenes, Harris's attorneys wrote in their brief for the court.\n\nUnfortunately for Harris, that's not how this works. Democrats, whose majority gives them the power to seat or refuse to seat new members, have been adamant: There will be no member from this district until there is a judgment on allegations that Harris paid a Republican operative to discard ballots that could have swung the election.\n\nWhat could happen next? North Carolina Republicans, who now say that Harris should be seated, are sticking with him and filing lawsuits on his behalf, attempting to move the matter to federal court. But if they lose there, a law passed by the Republican-run legislature would mandate any vacancy to be filled in a special election, preceded by a primary. One potential timeline: Both parties pick their nominees in a late spring primary, then elect a new congressman as late as November.\n\nThis would not be the longest vacancy in recent congressional history; a full year passed between the December 2017 resignation of Michigan's John Conyers and the seating of a Democrat who won the special November 2018 election to replace him. But it could mean that for most of the next year, Republicans have just 199 votes in the House, making it incrementally easier for Democrats to pass bills.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nWhy the New Democratic Majority Could Work Better Than the Last, by Ronald Brownstein\n\nThis point really can't be made enough: For the first time, Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives that does not include a conservative bloc from the South. The median member of the conference is now a center-left suburbanite.\n\nThe piece itself is funny, but it also gets at something that greatly aided Warren this week: As the first credible female candidate in the Democratic race, she endured the first attempts to brand a female candidate as unlikable, and that rallied even some Democrats who don't plan to support her.\n\nYou may already be running, by Alexandra Petri\n\nJust read it.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
But unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when Russians worked to help elect Donald Trump, the people behind the Alabama effort — dubbed Project Birmingham — were Americans. Now Democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in Project Birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.\n\nJones's narrow, upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. Moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in The Post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRecent revelations about Project Birmingham, however, have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign.\n\nAs the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and Facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the Project Birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. Those included a false flag effort that generated phony evidence that automated Russian accounts called bots had supported Moore on Twitter and the creation of a misleading Facebook page, aimed at Alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine Moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival Republican through a write-in campaign.\n\nBut all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProject Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\n\nHoffman gave $750,000 to a progressive technology start-up called American Engagement Technologies — founded by Mikey Dickerson, a former Obama administration official — that aimed to help Democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person said Dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire New Knowledge, a Texas-based social media research firm, to work in Alabama in support of Jones during the special election in December 2017.\n\nDickerson — who is best known for leading the effort to fix HealthCare.gov, the glitchy portal for President Barack Obama's signature health-care initiative — said in a statement to The Post that he learned of the extent of Project Birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI received the report in early 2018, which is when I first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics, Dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.\n\nThat report, he said, came from New Knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. More recently, it co-authored a report last month on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nJonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the Project Birmingham document and disputed Dickerson's claim that New Knowledge authored it.\n\n'Influence the outcome'\n\nWhat is known about Project Birmingham comes mainly from the 12-page document labeled Project Birmingham Debrief, which was obtained by The Post. It is dated Dec. 15, 2017, three days after the Alabama vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe document describes the effort as a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the AL senate race by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing Jones. Jones has said he had no knowledge of Project Birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.\n\nThe goal of the effort was to radicalize Democrats, suppress unpersuadable Republicans (hard Rs) and faction moderate Republicans by advocating for write-in candidates, the document states.\n\nThe document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving enough votes to ensure a Doug Jones victory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolitical analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.\n\nMy initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign I've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started, said University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith.\n\nLast September, Dickerson presented what he said was a truncated version of the Project Birmingham debrief at a meeting of technology experts — several of them alumni of the Obama administration — in downtown Washington. The 13 attendees of that meeting were required to sign nondisclosure agreements.\n\nAD\n\nIn the version of the document distributed at the meeting, a black rectangle obscured part of a sentence that would have made clear the name of the entity that conducted Project Birmingham. After weeks of declining to comment, Dickerson told The Post that the redaction was NK — for New Knowledge.\n\nAD\n\nPrior to presenting the report in September, I edited New Knowledge's report for length and to redact identifying information, Dickerson wrote in his statement to The Post. This was the only firsthand account of this kind of operation that I knew of, so I presented it to the group to analyze and discuss.\n\nDickerson declined to answer numerous other questions about the campaign, including what he knew of Hoffman's role.\n\nSome 'experiments'\n\nBefore Dickerson had sent his statement to The Post, Morgan, the New Knowledge chief, had publicly denied writing the Project Birmingham report or knowing about most of what it describes.\n\nAD\n\nMorgan, in comments to The Post and in a blog post on the self-publishing site Medium, acknowledged conducting some experiments with disinformation tactics during the Alabama election. Those included creating a Facebook page called Alabama Conservative Politics that shared news links with its followers. He also said that New Knowledge spent about $30,000 on targeted Facebook advertising during the Alabama election season and that he bought some retweets to test his ability to lift social media messages.\n\nAD\n\nMorgan characterized the work as a small, limited research project on Facebook while speculating that Project Birmingham as described in the debrief document was a combination of his efforts and those that might have been conducted by others. He described the Project Birmingham document as AET's report — suggesting it had been a product of Dickerson's start-up, American Engagement Technologies, also known as AET.\n\nI acknowledge working with AET, but I don't recognize the claims they're making now, Morgan said on Medium. We did not write the leaked report and we could not have because it didn't reflect our research. The leaked version of the report made a number of claims that did not originate with us.\n\nAD\n\nHoffman also has denied knowing about the operation in Alabama, though he has acknowledged providing the money to AET and apologized for his role in how it was eventually used.\n\nAD\n\nI find the tactics that have been recently reported highly disturbing, Hoffman said in a statement. For that reason, I am embarrassed by my failure to track AET — the organization I did support — more diligently as it made its own decisions to perhaps fund projects that I would reject.\n\nHoffman's financial relationship with AET was brokered by his political adviser, Dmitri Mehlhorn, who heads a group called Investing in US that helps direct Silicon Valley money into left-leaning political causes.\n\nMehlhorn said he too was unaware of key details about Project Birmingham, but he defended the idea of learning from the Russian disinformation operatives at the Internet Research Agency, who backed Trump in the 2016 election and in his first year in the White House, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency engaged in many, many tactics, some of which I think it is appropriate for us to mirror and some of which I think we should disavow. The tactics they engaged in [that] we need to disavow [include] misinformation and promoting racial hatred, Mehlhorn said. The tactics we need to mirror are really good social microtargeting.\n\nAnger after losing in 2016\n\nProject Birmingham had its roots in the anger and frustration Democrats felt after losing the White House and Congress in 2016 — with the assistance, many were convinced, of online disinformation peddled by Russians and also U.S. conservatives active on social media, who pushed damaging but false information about Democrat Hillary Clinton's health, honesty and suitability for office.\n\nOne person who expressed a desire to fight back was Dickerson, according to social media researcher Renee DiResta, who met him at a conference in Chicago in the same month that Trump was inaugurated. Dickerson told her at the time about his desire to create a start-up to battle political disinformation, she said.\n\nThere was a feeling after the Trump election that Democrats hadn't prioritized tech, that Republicans had built this amazing juggernaut machine, said DiResta. The right wing was running a meme war, and there were these crazy dirty tricks. People wanted to build countermeasures.\n\nDiResta briefly advised AET, offering technical guidance and helping them meet potential supporters in the months before Hoffman agreed to fund the company.\n\nDiResta, who also accepted a single share in AET and a seat on its board, said she became concerned with the opaqueness of the project, and severed ties with the company a few months after joining. She became research director at New Knowledge in January 2018 but said that, while she had heard of an experiment in Alabama, she did not know about the tactics.\n\n'The shifting of votes'\n\nWhile debate continues over who did what in Project Birmingham, The Post was able to find some evidence for several of the claims in the explanatory document.\n\nThe document, for example, says it planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet. We then tied that botnet to the Moore campaign digital director, making it appear as if he had purchased the accounts. Morgan denied any knowledge of the incident involving Russian bots.\n\nDuring the campaign, journalists wrote stories about Twitter accounts that appeared to be Russian followers of Moore.\n\nThose accounts were later suspended by Twitter. The Post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the Alabama election describing evidence that Russian bots were supporting Moore. The Project Birmingham document cited an article in the New York Post with the headline Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers.\n\nOther journalists, however, expressed skepticism at the time, noting that the supposed Russian bots made obvious mistakes, leaving profile information in some tweets in Cyrillic, the Russian-language alphabet.\n\nEvidence also supports the document's claims about creating a conservative Facebook page to siphon support away from Moore. In a section headed Splitting Republican votes, the document says that a Facebook page created by Project Birmingham had contact with a Republican write-in candidate beginning on Nov. 18, 2017, and later endorsed this candidate, who was not named.\n\nThe description and timing fits the experience of Mac Watson, the owner of a patio supply store who ran a Republican write-in campaign and said he had communications with a Facebook page beginning on that date.\n\nThe document also describes Project Birmingham helping the unnamed write-in candidate gain new Twitter followers — something Watson recalls as well, with 10,000 suddenly appearing on his account. He also gained some exposure with the help of the operator of the Facebook page, which the document claims acted as a media advisor helping to arrange interviews with news organizations. The document included an image of a Dec. 5 Washington Post story on Watson. The author of that piece, David Weigel, said he does not recall anyone arranging interviews for his story.
It slammed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, saying he was partly to blame because he had changed active shooter policy to say that deputies may enter a building to engage a shooter, indicating it wasn't necessary. Israel has changed the policy again. The report also noted that some sheriff's deputies said they could not remember the last time they underwent training for an active shooter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the report was critical of the school security program operated by Broward County Public Schools. The report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school Feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. Neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. It took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.\n\nThe report starts with this warning:\n\nSchool safety in Florida needs to be improved. We can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on K-12 school campuses. Not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. Safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSDHS) on February 14, 2018.\n\nThe 15-member commission included sheriffs from several Florida counties, including Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who served as chairman. The fathers of three students killed during the rampage were also appointed. The report will be sent to the Florida legislature and governor. The panel interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed a massive amount of evidence, it said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the most controversial recommendation among dozens made by the commission called for training and giving weapons to teachers willing to carry arms. It is not clear how that will be received by administrators, teachers, students and parents. Some of the student survivors of the shooting have become leaders in a national youth gun-control movement, and the Broward County School Board voted in April not to accept state money appropriated for that purpose.\n\nThe South Florida Sun Sentinel quoted Broward County School Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed in the shooting:\n\nTeachers went to school to teach. That is their expertise. Law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage a threat. Unfortunately, that didn't happen on 2/14, but I still think we should leave it in the hands of law enforcement.\n\nThe commission made recommendations it said schools should adopt immediately, including keeping school gates and doors locked when not in use, and making sure school personnel are present when gates and doors are being used. All doors should be locked, too, and teachers should be able to lock them from the inside, with access to the keys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also said every school should have a Code Red plan for emergencies and should train staff to execute that plan and communicate it to everyone at the school.\n\nAnd the panel said school safety requires attention to the mental health of students and acknowledged:\n\nFlorida's mental and behavioral health system is underfunded. Florida needs a better case management system, but no case management system can be effective unless there are effective services through which a person can be managed.
But a fighting force — even one as formidable as the United States military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. For service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. Currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. These choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.\n\nA recent survey of current and former military personnel conducted by my organization, the Collaborative for Student Success, along with the Military Times, a leading publication widely read by active duty and former U.S. military personnel, puts a finer point on the connection between the quality of K-12 education of military-connected children and readiness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than one-third of respondents, 35 percent, said dissatisfaction with a child's education was or is a significant factor in deciding whether to continue military service; 40 percent said they either have declined or would decline a career-advancing job at a different military installation to remain at their current military facility because of high performing schools. When asked, Did moving between states as part of your military service add challenges to your children's education, 70 percent answered yes.\n\nThe vast majority of survey respondents — 90 percent — reported having spent more than five years in the military. They have years of experience and expertise that our armed forces can ill-afford to lose.\n\nTheir core concern is one that all American parents contend with: schools with standards that are inconsistent from district to district or state to state and that, in many instances, don't adequately prepare children for career or college. But what sets military families apart is that, by design, they are highly nomadic. Our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many U.S. military installations. Children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their K-12 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result: Over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. As the Military Child Education Coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality. Military parents are often left to make career-related decisions based on keeping kids in schools they are comfortable with or moving their families and placing kids in unfamiliar schools where they might wind up either ahead of or behind their new classmates.\n\nA new assessment of several states with large military populations found that military families face a number of education obstacles, with the performance of students varying dramatically depending on geography. The Lexington Institute concluded that a shortage of high-quality educational programs for military-connected students, such as Advanced Placement classes in high school, often restricts educational opportunities, negatively impacts educational achievement, causes military families to make tough choices, inhibits quick assimilation into school communities, and can reduce a family's satisfaction with a military career.\n\nThe study focused on four states with large military populations, including Virginia. Among the findings, it noted overall success in the state, which has a wide distribution of military families and has military kids in every district. But it also found that many districts struggle to meet the academic and social emotional needs of military-connected students.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. military leaders are beginning to recognize the readiness connection.\n\nBefore he retired, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno indicated that local school performance would be a factor in the placement of Army units around the country. If state and local officials intend to keep military bases in their communities, Odierno said in 2013, they better start paying attention to the schools that are outside and inside our installations. Because as we evaluate and as we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria. He commissioned a study, highlighting which schools are successful — and which are not — to examine the quality of schools that serve the children of soldiers.\n\nLast year, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter unveiled a policy allowing service members to remain at a particular duty station for an extended period in exchange for extended service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, taking effect next year, creates a tool, the military student identifier number, that will allow schools to keep tabs on test scores, graduation rates and other metrics for military-connected students.
The double-edged advocacy reflects the quandary facing many industry leaders as President Trump continues his unprecedented attempt to overturn the election with the backing of a majority of Republican lawmakers.\n\nBusiness interests covet the check a Republican-controlled Senate would provide on the incoming Biden administration. But the version of the Republican Party many of them once called home — one that took fidelity to the Constitution for granted — is critically endangered. That fact is exemplified by the chaos engulfing the GOP as top party officials take sides over whether Trump's evidence-free claims of massive voter fraud justify his attempt to subvert the vote.\n\nTop CEOs and business groups made explicit their objection to the election challenges.\n\nNearly 200 senior executives signed on to a letter leaning on lawmakers to certify Biden's win in the most significant push yet to ensure Trump's assault on the election outcome falls short, Josh Dawsey reports. Signers included a wide array of executives of Fortune 500 companies, from the leaders of banks, airlines, investment firms, pharmaceutical companies, professional sports leagues, real estate conglomerates, top law firms and media companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the finance titans adding their names to the letter, organized by the Partnership for New York City: Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga; BlackRock CEO Larry Fink; Blackstone president Jonathan Gray; Lazard CEO Kenneth Jacobs; KKR co-CEO Henry Kravis; Carlyle Group CEO Kewsong Lee; Deutsche Bank Americas CEO Christiana Riley; Evercore Partners Co-CEO Ralph Schlosstein; Guggenheim Partners Executive Chairman Alan Schwartz; Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon; and Apollo Global Management Co-President James Zelter.\n\nAttempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they write, adding there should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power.\n\nLeading business lobbies in Washington joined the chorus.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue said, Efforts by some members of Congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.\n\nNational Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons said disappointment in the election outcome does not justify harming our democracy or undermining faith in our elections based on unproven charges and conspiracy theories… Now we ask Congress to join us in healing our nation, instead of fostering more division and vitriol.\n\nAnd the Business Roundtable, representing its roster of Fortune 200 CEOs, said it opposes efforts to delay or overturn the clear outcome of the election. With our country in the midst of a pandemic, business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs.\n\nYet in the last several weeks, donors from Wall Street and beyond have stepped up support for two Trump stalwarts in Georgia.\n\nBoth Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have proven loyal allies of the president. And the incumbents underlined the point this week as they defended the Trump's push to overturn Biden's victory in their state. Perdue reacted to the news Trump tried to bully Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) into reversing the election outcome by condemning as disgusting the taping and releasing of their Saturday conversation. And Loeffler on Monday declared she would join the dozen Republican senators who have pledged to oppose certifying Biden's electoral college win, repeating the pledge onstage with Trump at a rally in Dalton, Ga.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wave of publicly reported contributions predates those latest developments. But Loeffler and Perdue both have campaigned for months as lockstep Trump backers, including by refusing to acknowledge Biden's win. Wall Street donors nevertheless have been showering the pair with contributions because they are worried that a Democratic Senate would help President-elect Joe Biden push for tighter regulations on the financial industry, CNBC's Brian Schwartz reports, citing an unnamed GOP strategist with banking industry clients.\n\nThe roster of high-profile financiers cutting checks directly to one or both of the incumbents in recent weeks, per Schwartz and our own review of the candidates' most recent federal election filings, includes: hedge fund billionaire John Paulson; Fortress Investment Group CEO Randal Nardone; Arsenal Capital partner Stephen McLean; Silver Point Capital CEO Edward Mule; AQR Capital Management co-founder Clifford Asness; Owl Rock Capital co-founder Doug Ostrover; and Soroban Capital co-founder Eric Mandelblatt.\n\nThey join a handful of industry titans who have backed the Republicans on an entirely different scale by giving to the Senate Leadership Fund, the Mitch McConnell-affiliated super PAC. Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen Schwarzman gave that group $15 million on Nov. 12, the same day Citadel founder Ken Griffin forked over $10 million.\n\nAs Dawsey notes, Schwarzman didn't sign the CEO letter on Monday, but Jonathan Gray, the firm's president and chief operating officer, did.\n\nLoeffler and Perdue personify the challenge facing right-leaning business leaders uncomfortable with the party's trajectory.\n\nBoth appear willing to do whatever it takes to stay in Trump's good graces. They are also reliable corporate allies, hailing from C-suites themselves. Perdue was a senior executive at Reebok during a business career he capped by serving as CEO of Dollar General.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLoeffler's husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange. Loeffler spent years as a top executive at the company. At the time Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) tapped her to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson in 2019, she was serving as CEO of Bakkt, International Exchange's platform for trading digital currencies.\n\nBoth senators faced Justice Department scrutiny for stock trades they made early last year in the wake of briefings on the threat posed by the then-impending coronavirus pandemic. The Justice Department ended up dropping the probes.\n\nLatest on the federal pandemic response\n\nHouse Democrats vow new efforts on relief.\n\nElusive $2,000 checks are among the items being considered: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said that the $2,000 checks amount to 'unfinished business that should be continued as part of our effort to provide additional relief to the American people,' Erica Werner reports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats anticipate writing a new relief bill once Biden is sworn in Jan. 20. Its contours are uncertain, however, and the path forward will depend on the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections … Aid to state and local governments, left out of the most recent relief bill, remains a top priority for Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that 'we owe them more.'\n\nGoldman Sachs economists are predicting Democrats will approve $600 billion in new emergency relief if they sweep the Georgia runoffs to claim control of the Senate. Via AEI's Jim Pethokoukis:\n\nFed loan program for midsize firms had few takers: Washington was happy to rely on the Fed because it had the chops to get a program for medium-size businesses up and running fast. Its apolitical reputation reduced concern about loans being steered to big donors. The Treasury Department became a Fed partner to absorb any loan losses, the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos reports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the experience revealed the limitations of running a relief program through the Fed and exposed gaps in the government's ability to deliver aid to companies that can't raise money on Wall Street. For months, many banks weren't interested in participating.

So you take a look at other countries, Pakistan is there, they should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting, the reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union.\n\nWell, where to begin? For starters, the syntax is so mangled one could be genuinely skeptical he was saying anything more than, Russia. Afghanistan. Give it to Putin.\n\nBeyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that Trump endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the United States and the Free World. (You'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist Communist dictatorship.) Former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:\n\nThis strikes me as a typical Trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of Afghanistan, says former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to prop up one faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) against another. Their invasion catalyzed the existing Islamist opposition to the PDPA but I digress. (In other words, Trump's claim Russia went into Afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) Edelman adds, Simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. If Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would Russian President Vladimir Putin go back in?\n\nI am glad Trump brought up the end of the Soviet Union, however. The U.S.S.R. didn't magically change its name; the West won the Cold War (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things Trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran.\n\nMore to the point, why is Trump handing off chunks of the world — Syria, Afghanistan, the Sea of Azov — to America's greatest international foe? (Some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) And where does this giveaway stop — at the Baltics? At Berlin? (It's stunning that hawks such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who'd melt down if President Barack Obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. His policy is not America First — as in America leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. Rather it is, Russia First as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. If Ronald Reagan's response when asked how the Cold War would end was, We win, they lose, Trump's is: Putin wins. Let's bury our heads in the sand.\n\nEliot A. Cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious Trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, The president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of U.S. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the United States has sustained for nearly eight decades. He explains, The real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the United States should accept a more modest role in world affairs.\n\nIn short, at a time when we should fortify alliances, enhance diplomacy, bolster foreign aid, draw clear distinctions between democracies and authoritarians, and expand trade, we are doing the opposite, which merely encourages the go-it-alone voices on the right and the we-can-do-no-good-anyway voices on the left.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe should be worried, as Cohen points out, that Trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for America. Perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among American leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of U.S. foreign policy. . . . Trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the United States is merely one great power among others. In this view, Washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of U.S. leaders so carefully built.\n\nThe result of Trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by China; a less dynamic American economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change. It's not a world any of us should want to live in.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD
In a nutshell, Robb argues that trade — rather than national security — dominates Trump's foreign policy thinking, inverting decades of U.S. practice. By implication, that makes any country running a large trade surplus with the United States a direct competitor.\n\nAD\n\nIf Robb is right, that's very bad news for China, but it doesn't make welcome reading for countries such as Mexico, Germany and Japan. Unless they can take steps to reduce their trade imbalances with the United States, they are unlikely to be fully trusted by a man who sees trade as a zero-sum game, and sees anyone beating the United States as a threat.\n\nAD\n\nFirst, here's the analysis, in Robb's own words:\n\nSince WW2, U.S. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. In fact, it's hard to imagine a U.S. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. This means that ALL other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. In particular, U.S. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the Cold War) even if these trade relationships damage U.S. economic performance.\n\nTrump inverts that policy relationship. In Trump's post-Cold War world, U.S. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. Even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. If trade policy is dominant, we'll see China, Mexico and the EU (Germany) become competitors. Russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? China runs by far the largest trade surplus with the United States, some $319 billion in 2016. That's nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. In fact, China bought just $104 billion in U.S. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the United States.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Trump took less than 10 seconds into the first presidential debate to slam China for devaluing its currency and stealing American jobs.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, has also taken issue with China over its island-building in the South China Sea, and he has publicly questioned American adherence to the one-China policy, the basis for diplomatic relations between the two countries that rules out independence for the island of Taiwan.\n\nAD\n\nBut the implication of the trade-first philosophy is that neither Taiwan nor the South China Sea really matters to Trump, except as ways to beat up on a country he sees as a direct economic threat.\n\nIndeed, he has suggested as much, telling Fox News last month that he didn't know why the United States had to be bound by the one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\n\nAD\n\nThe other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in U.S.-China relations is probably here to stay, as long as Trump sticks around in the White House.\n\nBeijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and Trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from Asia to the United States. But China's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.\n\nAD\n\nHere's Robb again:\n\nNational security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. For example, military tension with China creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the U.S. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). In a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the U.S. The U.S. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the U.S. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).\n\nOf course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. Indeed, China's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across Asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the United States. Yet Robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.\n\nAD\n\nThe second-largest U.S. trade deficit in 2016 was with Japan, at $62.4 billion. Japan largely got a pass from the United States when it used protectionism and state subsidies to build its industries after World War II: then, it was seen as a key strategic ally worth supporting despite running a large trade surplus with the United States.\n\nTrump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. Japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. He has also warned Toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in Mexico, and he argued that Japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing U.S. troops in Okinawa.\n\nAD\n\nThe same goes for South Korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. Trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the Obama administration.\n\nAD\n\nThird on the list comes Germany, with a trade surplus with the United States running at $59.6 billion in 2016. If trade is all that matters, perhaps, it should not have come as such a surprise to hear Trump strike right at Berlin's heart when called NATO obsolete and argued that U.S. partners are not paying what they are supposed to be paying.\n\nIndeed, he implicitly argues, why should the United States be bearing a disproportionate burden of the cost of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when, as he suggested in a recent interview, Germany is just another one of those countries being very unfair to the U.S.?\n\nAD\n\nTrump has also taken aim at German carmakers, asking why so many Americans drive a Mercedes-Benz when Germany buys so few Chevrolets, and criticizing BMW over plans to build a new plant in Mexico. His criticism may have been unjustified, as Bertel Schmidt argues in Forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of ruining the country with her immigration policy, and the two leaders clearly have a very different worldview. But perhaps trade is the real root of Trump's distrust of Germany.\n\nFourth on the list comes Mexico, which ran a trade surplus with the United States of $58.8 billion in 2016. Trump, of course, is already preparing to build that wall, and get the Mexicans to pay for it.\n\nOf course, this framework is only one way of looking at Trump's foreign policy priorities, and it doesn't explain his hawkish stance over Iran or concern over North Korea's nuclear program.
Children from Oyster Adams Elementary walk to their school. A new policy aims at giving parents more choices to enroll students in charter schools within walking distance of their homes. (Kate Patterson for The Washington Post) (Kate Patterson/For The Washington Post)\n\nThousands of D.C. children who live near public elementary charter schools could soon qualify for a new admission preference to help them enroll in those schools under a plan Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced Monday.\n\nUnder the city's current policy, students have a guaranteed seat in a traditional public school near their home. But those assigned neighborhood schools — all part of the D.C. Public Schools — are sometimes more than a half mile away. That can make it hard for elementary students to walk to school.\n\nIn those cases, Bowser said, families that live no more than a half mile from a charter school should get special consideration through the city's school lottery system. The mayor said she wants to make it easier for more of our students to enroll in charter schools that are within walking distance of their home.\n\nBowser's proposal for a walkability preference would target an estimated 10,000 students who live more than a half mile away from their assigned traditional school but less than a half mile from a charter school. Charter schools would not be required to offer an admission preference to those students, but they would be allowed to do so.\n\nThe policy, if approved by the D.C. Council, would take effect in the 2018-19 school year. It could have a significant effect on a public education marketplace that gives parents many options. About 29,000 students from pre-kindergarten through 5th grade were enrolled in D.C. Public Schools in 2015-16, compared to about 21,600 in charter elementary schools that year.\n\nBowser has pushed to increase school choice in the District. But some education advocates questioned Monday's proposal. They said it could drain students from traditional D.C. schools and make it harder for students from low-income families to get into top charter schools, which are often located outside of their neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2012, a 12-member D.C. task force considered whether to require all charter schools to offer a neighborhood preference, but the idea was rejected.\n\nCouncil member David Grosso (I-At Large), who chairs the Council's education committee, said he has some reservations about the proposal and has already heard some vocal uproar.\n\nThis is very complicated stuff that could perpetuate divisions within our city and communities, and it will have to be very thought through, Grosso said. I am not too inclined to support it, but I am open to having a conversation.\n\nUnder the lottery system, there are charter school enrollment preferences for children of founding board members and siblings of current students. Grosso said adding another preference would possibly deny students an equal opportunity to enroll in quality schools.\n\nIt is unknown how many of the District's 82 elementary charter schools support the measure. Scott Pearson, executive director of the D.C. Public Charter School Board, called the measure an interesting enrollment proposal that addresses real issues families face.\n\nHe added, All preferences have complex effects so we're speaking with school leaders and others to better understand their perspectives.\n\nEboni-Rose Thompson, the chair of the Ward 7 education council, said she fears the changes would mean less access to high-quality schools. In Ward 7, for example, there are no dual-language charter schools. Most of those schools are in Wards 1 and 4. Under the proposal, some students in Ward 1 might have greater access to those schools because they live near them. That would leave fewer seats available for students from Ward 7.\n\nWhen we accepted charters into the city, they were supposed to be city-wide schools. What happened to that? Thompson asked. Do we just throw that away because we are trying to get at a different problem?\n\nCaryn Ernst, a parent activist, sits on a mayoral task force that aims to increase collaboration between charters and the school system. Ernst said she was surprised to learn about Bowser's proposal. The task force last fall considered and rejected a similar idea, according to Ernst.\n\nThe idea that she would announce this is astonishing to me and it completely undermines the purpose of a task force, Ernst said.\n\nBowser also proposed raising annual facilities funding for charter schools, to $3,193 per pupil. That would be 2.2 percent more than the current level of $3,124 per pupil.\n\nBowser announced her proposals at D.C. Bilingual Public Charter School in Northeast Washington, along Pearson and Deputy Mayor for Education Jennifer C. Niles. John Davis, the interim chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, was not present.\n\nAntwan Wilson, the incoming chancellor of DCPS, starts his new job Wednesday.\n\nMichelle Lerner, the spokeswoman for DCPS, said the school system looks forward to working with the city on the lottery changes so that all families can access high-quality schools.
According to standard conceptions of democracy — which focus on violations of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly and the press — Hungary's status as an autocracy is ambiguous. The two most widely used indexes of democracy — conducted by Freedom House and Polity — continue to code Hungary as democratic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClearly, Hungary is not a democracy. But understanding why requires a nuanced understanding of the line between democracy and autocracy.\n\nDemocracy requires a level playing field\n\nIn our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. Leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. These autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.\n\nIn any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. But an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. Let's look at how that works.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirst, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. Governing parties may also create a biased news media. In Malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.\n\nGoverning parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. The most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win. A country is not a democracy when gerrymandering makes it all but impossible for the opposition to win national power.\n\nFinally, ruling parties may pack judiciaries, electoral commissions and other nominally independent bodies to ensure that the incumbent will win critical electoral, legal or other disputes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAuthoritarianism, Hungarian style\n\nOrban's Hungary is a prime example of a competitive autocracy with an uneven playing field. In 2010, Orban's Fidesz party won 53 percent of the vote and 68 percent of parliamentary seats. Since then, the party has increasingly denied opposition access to resources necessary to compete for power.\n\nFirst, Fidesz infiltrated much of the state bureaucracy. By 2012, Fidesz loyalists were already entrenched in every corner of the state, as Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele documented — including in the constitutional court, budget council, electoral commission, national judicial office, state audit office, public prosecutor's office and national bank. That brings significant advantages. For example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, Fidesz has changed the electoral rules in ways that make it easier for the party to dominate. That includes significant gerrymandering — splitting off constituencies with a leftist majority to dilute the opposition vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with Orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power. But the uneven playing field creates a daunting obstacle to opposition victory at the ballot box.\n\nThe advantages of an uneven playing field\n\nKilling a journalist or firing on crowds of protesters can easily rally international opinion and turn an autocrat into a pariah. But few notice or care if party supporters infiltrate the electoral commission or a pro-government entrepreneur uses government funds to take control over an opposition website. And using the legal system to force out independent voices enables the government to argue that it has not abused power. For example, after forcing a leading independent university out of Hungary, the government argued that this was the result of a perfectly reasonable requirement under Hungary's legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFidesz's ambiguous tactics have succeeded. Most importantly, the European Union has, with a few exceptions, failed to confront Orban's government about its democratic backsliding. As long as Orban is able to maintain such ambiguity, he is unlikely to face serious consequences for his country's democratic failures.\n\nLucan Ahmad Way is a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\nSteven Levitsky is a professor of government at Harvard University.
She continued in her role as editor in chief of the Texas Tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. In March last year, she sat down with Amanda Zamora, the Tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit ProPublica, and presented her idea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou could tell she was completely taken with this idea of a site that looked at the impact of politics and policy on women, Zamora said. Once she is set on something, you have no doubt that she's going to make it happen, and I knew it was something I wanted to participate in.\n\nThe two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.\n\nOn Monday, Ramshaw and Zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and Kathryn Murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.\n\nThis isn't the day's news but pink. This is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said Ramshaw, who is CEO of the nonprofit. We are not doing turn-of-the-screw reporting, but rather what that turn of the screw means for different parts of the women's electorate.\n\nThe name derives from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. Given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the American media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, Ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 19th Amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said Zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. The 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.\n\nThe organization is launching with a single reporter in the field, Errin Haines, who previously covered race and ethnicity for the Associated Press. She will cover the 2020 race. A bare-bones site is launching Monday. Until 19thnews.org is fully built later this year, the 19th's articles will publish on The Washington Post's website.\n\nNewmark was among the first donors and made a $500,000 gift. We need a news outlet about gender politics that does a lot of fact-checking with absolutely no mansplaining, he said in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKathryn Murdoch, the wife of Rupert Murdoch's younger son, James, pledged $1 million to the venture. Convinced by polling showing women had vastly different views from men on issues such as climate change and Trump, Murdoch saw the relevance of Ramshaw's idea.\n\nYou need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and I look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting Band-Aids on them after they develop, Murdoch said.\n\nWhen asked how the 19th was different from the news outlets her family owns, which include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, she simply said the 19th and the foundation she and her husband operate are reflective of her values.\n\nAD\n\nShe and her husband were recently critical of the way Murdoch media properties have covered the Australian wildfires. In an interview with The Post, she shied away from commenting about Fox News or other Murdoch outlets. This is what I do, and I'm happy to be taken to task on any of it, but that is all I control.\n\nAD\n\nA few years ago I might have said, 'No, no [to Ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  Murdoch said. But the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: It was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.\n\nRamshaw is not accepting anonymous donations to the site and will maintain a list of funders on the site in an effort to be as transparent as possible about who is supporting the journalism at the 19th.\n\nAD\n\nOn launch day, the organization, which has hired an editor in chief, will post 17 jobs; nine in the newsroom including beats covering women in Congress, in the economy, statehouses and several others. They are hiring to fill positions to cover specific demographics that make up the female electorate, including black and Latina women. The site will have no opinion or editorial section.\n\nAnd the publication is not averse to hiring men — its CFO is male.
You shouldn't be enduring this, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said during a conference call Friday with federal union leaders and members. This is truly a shutdown [that] makes no sense whatsoever. Government should be open, should never have closed.\n\nAD\n\nHearing from rank-and-file feds might give Trump a better idea of the difficulties they are facing and a more realistic sense of their views on being locked out of their jobs and required to work with no guarantee of pay. Payday this Friday is in grave danger of disappearing.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who suggested the shutdown could last for months or even years, displayed woeful ignorance of the plight of federal workers at a news conference Friday, when he said they would encourage him to keep going with the shutdown, because a border wall is far more important than a fully operational government. He apparently got that impression from Border Patrol officers he met with Thursday. These officers, federal workforce outliers, endorsed his wall, just as they did his candidacy, even though they are also victims of his shutdown.\n\nIt comes down to border security. … We are extremely grateful to President Trump, and we fully support what he is doing to take care of our nation's borders, Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, said during a Thursday news conference with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nTalk with federal employees and you'll quickly learn that sentiment doesn't reflect the views of many, including those in the council's parent union, the American Federation of Government Employees. During the conference call Friday, AFGE's policy director Jacqueline Simon made it clear that the council's stance does not reflect that of the union.\n\nAD\n\nNo matter what some of our members may think of Mr. Trump's agenda on immigration and border security, we know that all of them, they need their paychecks and they can't go to the grocery store, pay their rent or their child-care expenses with their love of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, Simon said. We know our members and every single agency affected by the shutdown are terrified that when the day comes that there's no paycheck on payday.\n\nIf Trump talked to more federal employees, he would hear stories from people like Katherine Scheflen, a lawyer in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. She needs her check on time. I am a single mother of two disabled children. I live paycheck to paycheck, as do many Americans, she said. It is not complicated — if I miss a paycheck, I cannot pay my mortgage and my other bills. It is as simple as that.\n\nAD\n\nCongress will probably provide backpay for furloughed federal employees such as Scheflen. But the likelihood of money in the future doesn't pay bills due today. Backpay for low-wage contractors, like those who serve lunch in federal cafeterias, is less likely.\n\nAD\n\nI live pay check to pay check like nearly all of my coworkers, and I'm scared that with losing weeks of income and my healthcare benefits, one family medical emergency for myself, my children, or my grandchildren during Donald Trump's shut down could make us homeless, said Lisa Earle in a statement provided by Unite Here, which represents the Smithsonian worker. It's not fair that politicians playing games put me out of work, and it's even worse that my coworkers and I may never get back pay for the shutdown when we're just as impacted as all other federal workers.\n\nIt's ludicrous that Americans are denied federal services and workers like Scheflen and Earle suffer because Trump and Democrats differ over $4 billion for the border wall in a $4 trillion budget. Trump bogusly and repeatedly promised during his 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for his unpopular wall proposal.\n\nAD\n\nYet, while there is certainly an argument to be made for Democrats to meet Trump's hostage demands, make no mistake, this is Trump's shutdown, and increasingly that of congressional Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nTrump's intransigence demonstrates the hollowness of the Republican position. He rejects, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to consider, appropriation measures the Senate approved last month that would end the shutdown. The House voted for the legislation after Democrats took control last week, but McConnell won't call for a necessary vote in the Senate.\n\nThe legislation would fund agencies indirectly related to border security. The Department of Homeland Security would receive temporary funding, providing a month for the discussions to continue.\n\nAD\n\nIt should be a no-brainer. McConnell called the House approval a time-wasting act of political posturing, even though the House followed the lead of his Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nWe're just going to have to work very hard, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on the call with Cardin, to increase the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold that vote.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican voters will increase that pressure as government services continue to deteriorate.
The Georgia elections, if they go the way of Democrats, would expand the ranks of senators backing a public option.\n\nDemocrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are seeking to unseat Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, and give their party 50 seats in the Senate, making Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris the tie-breaking vote. Polls in Georgia close at 7 p.m., concluding a race that has seen record-breaking spending for a nonpresidential election.\n\nGeorgia's two Republican Senate candidates careened over the weekend toward a rocky end to their high-stakes dual runoff races, trying hard to avoid becoming collateral damage in a series of raging disputes that have embroiled the GOP, our colleague Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth Ossoff and Warnock have said they want to expand health insurance incrementally through broadening the Affordable Care Act and creating a government-backed public option plan for Americans, rather than overhauling the whole system with Medicare-for-all or something like it.\n\nThis is the approach advocated by Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Democrats. Yet the Republicans spent the last two months pummeling Ossoff and Warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as Medicare-for-all proponents.\n\nThe Republican talking points are the things we heard in the general elections, [that the Democrats are] radical socialists who want a government-run health-care system, said Ken Thorpe, professor of health policy at Emory University. On almost every ad it's either directly talked about or implied.\n\nYet even incremental health coverage expansion won't necessarily be possible in the Senate, even if Ossoff and Warnock win.\n\nWith 50 seats and a tie-breaking vote from Harris, Senate Democrats would have to get every single one of their members in line — or nab the help of some Republicans to pass legislation. And unless there's a budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass, they'd need 60 votes to get around any filibusters.\n\nAny significant health-care legislation will likely originate in the Democrat-run House.\n\nAnd now House Democrats have tweaked rules around paying for legislation, potentially making it easier for their members to pass bills if they can be reasonably seen as related to the coronavirus pandemic or climate change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNormally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. This requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.\n\nBut House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) advanced two major exceptions, which the House approved yesterday. Legislation to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic or public health consequences of the coronavirus pandemic or climate change will be exempted from the pay-as-you-go rules.\n\nThis could make it easier for the lower chamber to pass bills related to the coronavirus pandemic and send them over to the Senate, putting pressure on that body to approve them.\n\nAD\n\nThe move will likely spur House Democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand Medicare and Medicaid during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nThis is a rules package that encourages us to tackle the most pressing issues facing our nation today, McGovern said in a floor speech Monday. It makes reforms to our budget rules so we can deal with these dual challenges through an all-hands-on-deck approach while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n\nAhh, oof and ouch\n\nAHH: U.S. health officials are rejecting suggestions to defer the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIn recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimens that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.\n\nAD\n\nThe United Kingdom has already announced it will prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose of an authorized vaccine, even if it means delaying the booster shot. Limited data suggests the first vaccine dose may offer partial protection, and some prominent public health officials argue it's worth taking the risk to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nAD\n\nBut top government health officials dismiss the suggestion. Leading infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui have all recently roundly rejected proposals to alter the timeline of the two-dose vaccine regimen.\n\nThere really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. Fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.\n\nSo far, the United States has only administered a small fraction of the vaccine doses that have been distributed to states, according to a Washington Post tracker, which looks at vaccine priorities and administration state by state.\n\nVaccine administration rates vary across states. While Georgia has vaccinated 0.7 percent of its population, South Dakota has vaccinated 3 percent of its population.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost states have adopted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. But states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.\n\nOOF: England is entering a new national lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak driven by a new, more contagious virus variant.\n\n\n\nWith most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday. In England, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe shutdown is the country's third after lockdowns initiated in March and November, The Post's Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Ben Guarino report. Johnson said the new variant of the virus, which has so far spread to at least 30 countries, is thought to be 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a new national lockdown in England on Jan. 4 to try to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. (Reuters)\n\nNew York confirmed its first case of the new U.K. strain on Monday. The case was identified in a 60-year-old man who had no recent travel history and comes after cases have also been identified in California, Florida and Colorado.\n\nSouth Africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. Britain's health minister Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the UK new variant. The South Africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of Britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.\n\nOUCH: Young ER doctors who risked their lives in the pandemic are struggling to find jobs.\n\nYoung doctors, called residents, who specialize in emergency medicine are struggling to find full-time employment even while working on the front lines of the covid-19 response. The doctors, many of whom are saddled with debt from medical school, find themselves in a predicament that would have been unimaginable for them a year earlier, The Post's Ben Guarino reports.\n\nThe dearth of jobs is the result of a domino effect: Many people stayed away from hospital emergency rooms this past year, wary of contracting the virus. As patient numbers dropped, emergency departments brought in less money. As a result, cash-strapped employers stopped recruiting new doctors, Ben writes.\n\nSome residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls. A survey from the American College of Emergency Physicians found that 20 percent of emergency medicine practices laid off doctors this year. It's a strange paradox in the midst of a pandemic when it seems like emergency medicine doctors should be in high demand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're putting our own lives at risk, our family's lives at risk, emergency medicine physician R.J. Sontag, the president of the Emergency Medicine Residents' Association, told The Post. We're in, frankly, a financially precarious position with a ton of debt and limited income. And the fact of the matter is that employers just aren't hiring.\n\nMore in coronavirus\n\n\n\nA Florida state representative is calling for Mar-a-Lago to be shut down after President Trump's private club held a New Year's Eve bash in which attendees did not wear masks in violation of a Palm Beach County mask order, The Post's Lori Rozsa reports .

The following day the U.S. agency said that China reported its first cases to the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019, and that at least 44 cases had been reported, The Post's Siobhán O'Grady reports\n\nBecause vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. This happened, for instance, at a Giant Foods store in Northeast Washington, D.C., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, The Post's Lola Fadulu reports . The decision was in line with guidance from the D.C. Department of Health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.\n\nElsewhere in health care\n\nA high-profile venture that promised to disrupt health care is disbanding.\n\nHaven, created two years ago by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website Monday that it will shutter, The Post's Jay Greene reports.\n\nAD\n\nThe venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy, Berkshire's Warren Buffett said in a statement at the time. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\n\nBut the initiative is ending with little to show for its efforts, as health-care costs continued to grow in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. A spokesperson for Haven said that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase would continue to leverage insights gained from the joint-venture. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).\n\nChildren's hospitals may be partially to blame to for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA growing body of research shows that overuse and misuse of antibiotics in children's hospitals — which health experts and patients say should know better — helps fuel these dangerous bacteria that attack adults and, increasingly, children. Doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, Kaiser Health News's Laura Ungar reports.\n\nAD\n\nA study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in U.S. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. The study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.\n\nResearchers say that the overprescription of antibiotics is fueling drug resistant strains of dangerous bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
But it's now far from clear when — or even if — the panic-inducing drawdown will take place. Trump seemed chastened by the backlash in Washington and extended his initial 30-day deadline for the pullout to four months. Administration officials have since muddied the waters further, briefing reporters that there is no timeline for withdrawal whatsoever.\n\nWe're pulling out of Syria, Trump said Sunday, before offering a significant caveat. But ... we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the chaos is a clear split within the White House. Trump, who espouses a kind of nationalist isolationism, is keen on disentangling the United States from costly military adventures that offer him minimal political returns at home.\n\nUnlike many Republican wonks in Washington, Trump was never interested in removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. In December, he perfunctorily declared that the Islamic State had been defeated — despite mountains of evidence to the contrary — and said it was largely the responsibility of Turkey and other Arab countries to carry on the fight.\n\nNational security advisor John Bolton said on Jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that Turkey will not target Kurdish forces. (Reuters)\n\nLeading hawks in Washington, including key figures within the administration, see things much differently. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and Trump's special envoy to Syria, former diplomat James Jeffrey, all argue that U.S. military involvement in Syria is aimed not just at defeating Islamist militants but also at countering Iranian influence in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA U.S. official told The Washington Post that Trump never personally endorsed this strategy, and the president has publicly hinted as much. During a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump offhandedly remarked that Iran's leadership can do what they want in Syria.\n\nThe top brass in the Pentagon, meanwhile, is hardly convinced that the Islamic State has been defeated. Military officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and Turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it considers part of a Kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the Islamic State, my colleagues reported.\n\nThis week, senior administration officials are jetting around the Middle East in a bid to assuage allies that the White House is still committed to their security interests. But so far, they're mostly betraying the discord within the administration over what comes next.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo, a vocal advocate of the anti-Iran strategy, will make an eight-country swing through all six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman — as well as Egypt and Jordan. He will try to present a united front despite the White House's increasingly incoherent approach to the region.\n\nThe counter-Iran campaign continues, Pompeo told right-wing outlet Newsmax on Thursday. We'll do all of those things. … We will simply do it at a time when the American forces have departed Syria.\n\nBolton, meanwhile, was in Israel over the weekend and will later head to Turkey, where he'll be accompanied by Jeffrey — the Syria envoy — and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seemingly contradicting Trump, Bolton told reporters that no withdrawal from Syria will take place until the Islamist militants are fully defeated and Turkey guarantees the safety of Syrian Kurdish units allied with the United States but considered terrorist enemies by Ankara.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton said. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThe facts on the ground suggest the timetable will be rather open-ended. The diplomatic wrangling with Turkey — which has vowed a military operation against Kurdish units across its southern border — may prove to be deeply complicated. A security guarantee for the Syrian Kurds could just be a new unobtainable condition, tweeted Faysal Itani of the Atlantic Council. Seeing their options dwindling, the main Syrian Kurdish armed faction has opened talks with the Assad regime, requesting military support from Damascus against a potential Turkish offensive.\n\nHawks in the Washington establishment have cheered Trump's apparent about-face. I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), telling CBS's Face the Nation that the bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the president for reevaluating what he's doing. ... He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut others see the latest changes as more evidence of an administration conflicted and confused about its agenda overseas. Bolton got way out ahead of the policy, and it's his job to understand what the president wants, Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador in Syria, said to my colleagues. When the president is nervous or cautious about something, it's the NSC's job to relay that back to State and the Pentagon, and warn them not to go too far. Apparently they didn't get the message.
In normal times, restaurant and bar writers look for the new and different: breaking trends, hot chefs or bars that offer a vibe their neighbors don't. This inherent tendency to seek what's fresh and exciting is, I think, why businesses are so often praised and admired for pivoting to new models during the pandemic, when whiplash changes to menus and physical spaces are often born less of creative innovation than desperately trying to find a way for the business to stay afloat. For some, it was building a beer garden in the parking lot; for others, it was tossing out their critically acclaimed menus to make sandwiches and simpler fare.\n\nBut despite the chaos, there were some innovations that made the lives of staff and customers easier, or even better. The District changed alcohol laws to allow bars to sell cocktails and six-packs for carryout and delivery, providing a source of income when indoor spaces were closed to the public. The idea proved so popular that the regulations became permanent in October. No one can predict exactly when we'll get back to normal, but whenever that happens, I hope these other changes stick around.\n\nLet us drink (and dine) in closed streets and parking spaces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarly in the pandemic, cities across the country began closing streets to traffic to provide more room for socially distanced running and biking. And by summer, as restaurants took their first steps toward reopening, they began to stake their own claims to the streets, moving tables into pedestrianized roads. The result was charming, comfortable and provided a sense of quasi-normalcy after spring's stay-at-home orders.\n\nThis wasn't a radical new idea: Annapolis closes busy West Street for a weekly street festival each summer, and Old Town Alexandria voted in 2019 to close a stretch of King Street on weekends between April and October. But the dire situation facing restaurants and bars forced local jurisdictions to reconsider their priorities: Diners enjoying a meal, a beer garden and entertainment outdoors were judged more important than drivers going a few blocks out of their way. With restaurants staring into a financial abyss, these models should continue for the foreseeable future. Make outdoor dining the destination, whether that's tables with waterfront views in Annapolis's historic downtown, or Bethesda's food court-style tables, which let visitors choose from any nearby restaurant — perfect for the group who can't decide on one cuisine.\n\nD.C., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of Dupont Circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of Eighth Street NW in Penn Quarter. (The closure of 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) Where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. It was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. Even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.\n\nReplace tips with mandatory 20 percent service charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTipping is a difficult topic. It's a vestige of Reconstruction-era discrimination that, according to study after study, perpetuates racism, sexism and ageism in dining rooms. But restaurant owners are loath to raise menu prices to the point where tipping isn't necessary to pay staff a real wage, because customers have become used to low, tip-subsidized prices. Some customers seem to really enjoy the feeling of power they have over restaurant and bar workers, mentally dinging percentage points off a tip if the steak isn't medium-rare or the wine glasses aren't topped up every time.\n\nBut when servers who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing both a decline in tips and a rise in sexual harassment, should we really be leaving an employee's rent money in the hands of people who ask servers to remove their masks before deciding to add or subtract a few bucks? Of course not.\n\nTo guarantee a decent wage, a number of places I've visited in the past year, from fancy restaurants to casual cocktail spots to rooftop beer gardens, have levied mandatory service charges of around 20 percent. They offer the chance to leave more, but not less, preventing customers from stiffing a server over a perceived slight. It's a great start — we should all be adding 20 percent anyway, right? — while the industry and governments come to grips with the mechanics and failures of tipping. Gratitude is a buzzword this year. Let's start with restaurant employees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLet us keep making reservations.\n\nI am not much for planning, partially because I don't want to tie myself down to being at a specific place at a set time weeks from now. (Maybe that's an issue for a professional to address.) I am also a traditionalist who is opposed to reserved seating in bar areas, as well as at beer gardens and breweries. Or at least I was.\n\nWith bar patios operating at a fraction of their capacity, an increasing number of establishments began to offer the ability to make reservations. In addition to higher-end destinations, I've made them for low-key neighborhood spots, like All Souls and Trusty's, where I've always just been happy to take my chances walking in and standing around until a seat opened up. And you know what? Having a guaranteed seat has been a godsend.\n\nAD\n\nDuring weekend visits to Archipelago or Cotton and Reed — two places where I had never made a reservation in my life — I repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. In the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. In fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. Visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: Attempts to visit Wunder Garten or Dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.\n\nAD\n\nSome big outdoor spaces, such as the Midlands Beer Garden and Biergarten Haus, take reservations while leaving most space available for walk-ins — consider a booking an insurance policy — and I'd even think twice about making the trip out to some of the region's bigger farm breweries, including Wheatland Spring and Waredaca, if I hadn't reserved a table in advance. Will we return to a more laissez faire system of bar crawls in the future? Maybe. In the meantime, I'm going to stick to my calendar.\n\nContactless ordering and payment should stay an option — at some places.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. After all, it's not just, If I eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, If I eat at this restaurant, could I make my server sick? As a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. I have to admit, I kind of liked it.\n\nAD\n\nFarewell to the little dance where a server brings you water and disappears; comes back to take your drink order and disappears; returns with cocktails, recites the specials and disappears while you decide on what to have for dinner. The pace of the evening is now in your hands. Know what you want to drink? Order as soon as you sit down, and you can sip while deciding what to snack on. Anyone who's needed to make a quick exit because of a cranky child (or cranky adult who's had one too many), appreciates the ability to settle the bill instantly and quietly.\n\nThat said, there are bars where I want to engage the staff about new beers and cocktails on the menu, or solicit opinions about the best wine to complement an entree. Contactless ordering has the effect of turning professional servers into glorified food runners. But for large, busy spaces, such as beer gardens or slammed happy hour spots, tech might offer a better way forward.\n\nAD\n\nBreweries and distilleries: Please keep leaving booze on my doorstep.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. breweries and distilleries have always had the legal ability to deliver their products directly to consumers. Virginia and Maryland producers had a few more hoops to jump through, but could also deliver or ship beer. But it wasn't until the pandemic shut bars and tasting rooms, denying them much needed revenue, that most began to look into it.\n\nIt soon became a lifeline, with some brewery owners delivering cases by hand, and Rockville's True Respite setting up the popular biermi online order and delivery service, which they shared with breweries across the region. As shelves in supermarkets and liquor stores have become more crowded, delivery has become a new niche where breweries can stand out — look at 3 Stars and its monthly CSB delivery program, which puts unreleased, ultra-fresh beers in the hands of members before the general public. But more importantly, this is a way for breweries to use a perceived convenience as a way to introduce themselves to new audiences.\n\nI'd rather pay for rounds than run up a tab.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the United Kingdom, I've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. For those unfamiliar with the concept: You order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. When glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. Repeat. No waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me. (Dealing with people who duck out on rounds is a discussion for another time.)\n\nBartenders in the United States, though, tend to dislike the concept, because time is money, and they could be pouring beers or whipping up drinks instead of stopping to take cash or run credit cards from the same group multiple times throughout the night. It's more economical to just wait until everyone is leaving.
